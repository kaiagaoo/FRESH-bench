CRISPR has been used to correct for this. Similarly, for Dravet syndrome, an epilepsy disorder, CRISPR has been used to correct the SCN1A gene mutation. Despite the progress that has been made, there are still challenges with using CRISPR, one of which being the transfer of CRISPR components across the blood-brain barrier. However, recent advancements in nanoparticle delivery syste"}}, "change_classification": {"type": "FACTUAL_UPDATE", "subtype": "content_update", "complexity": "complex", "reversal": false}, "temporal_gradient": {"T-4": {"date": "2023-01-01", "fact_state": "old", "doc_id": "doc_crispr_gene_editing_2023-01-01"}, "T-3": {"date": "2023-06-01", "fact_state": "old", "doc_id": "doc_crispr_gene_editing_2023-06-01"}, "T-2": {"date": "2024-01-01", "fact_state": "old", "doc_id": "doc_crispr_gene_editing_2024-01-01"}, "T-1": {"date": "2024-06-01", "fact_state": "old", "doc_id": "doc_crispr_gene_editing_2024-06-01"}, "T0": {"date": "2024-09-16", "fact_state": "change_event"}, "T+1": {"date": "2025-01-01", "fact_state": "new", "doc_id": "doc_crispr_gene_editing_2025-01-01"}}, "derived_qa_ids": ["freshrag_00767_1", "freshrag_00767_2", "freshrag_00767_3"], "verification": {"wikidata_verified": false, "human_verified": false, "confidence": 0.0}}
