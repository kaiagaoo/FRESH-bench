The tumor [[antigens]] are often [[protein]]s or other macromolecules (e.g., [[carbohydrate]]s). Normal antibodies bind to external pathogens, but the modified [[immunotherapy]] antibodies bind to the tumor antigens marking and identifying the cancer cells for the immune system to inhibit or kill. The clinical success of cancer immunotherapy is highly variable between different forms of cancer; for instance, certain subtypes of [[gastric cancer]] react well to the approach whereas immunotherapy is not effective for other subtypes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kodach LL, Peppelenbosch MP | title =  Targeting the Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell Compartment for Inducing Responsiveness to Immune Checkpoint Blockade Is Best Limited to Specific Subtypes of Gastric Cancers. | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 161 | issue = 2 | pages = 727 | date = August 2021 | pmid = 33798523  | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2021.03.047 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, American immunologist [[James P.

Examples include therapeutic cancer vaccines (also known as treatment vaccines,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-09-30|title=What are Cancer Vaccines?|url=https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-treated/immunotherapy-and-vaccines/what-are-cancer-vaccines|access-date=2021-08-15|website=Cancer.Net|language=en}}</ref> which are designed to boost the body's immune system to fight cancer), [[Chimeric antigen receptor T cell|CAR-T cells]], and targeted antibody therapies. In contrast, passive immunotherapy does not directly target tumor cells, but enhances the ability of the immune system to attack cancer cells. Examples include [[checkpoint inhibitor]]s and [[cytokine]]s.\n\nActive cellular therapies aim to destroy cancer cells by recognition of distinct markers known as [[antigen]]s. In cancer vaccines, the goal is to generate an immune response to these antigens through a vaccine. Currently, only one vaccine ([[sipuleucel-T]] for prostate cancer) has been approved. In cell-mediated therapies like CAR-T cell therapy, immune cells are extracted from the patient, [[genetically engineer]]ed to recognize tumor-specific antigens, and returned to the patient. Cell types that can be used in this way are [[natural killer cell|natural killer (NK) cell]]s, [[lymphokine-activated killer cell]]s, [[cytotoxic T cell]]s, and [[dendritic cell]]s. Finally, specific antibodies can be developed that recognize cancer cells and target them for destruction by the immune system. Examples of such antibodies include [[rituximab]] (targeting CD-20), [[trastuzumab]] (targeting HER-2), and [[cetuximab]] (targeting EGFR).\n\nPassive antibody therapies aim to increase the activity of the immune system without specifically targeting cancer cells. For example, cytokines directly stimulate the immune system and increase immune activity. Checkpoint inhibitors target proteins ([[immune checkpoint]]s) that normally dampen the immune response. This enhances the ability of the immune system to attack cancer cells. Current research is identifying new potential targets to enhance immune function. Approved checkpoint inhibitors include antibodies such as [[ipilimumab]], [[nivolumab]], and [[pembrolizumab]].\n\n==Cellular immunotherapy==\n===Dendritic cell therapy===\n[[File:Dendritic_cell_therapy.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Blood cells are removed from the body, incubated with tumour antigen(s),  and activated.

This can be achieved by either genetically engineering tumor cells to produce GM-CSF or by infecting tumor cells with an [[oncolytic virus]] that expresses GM-CSF.\n\nAnother strategy is to remove dendritic cells from the blood of a patient and activate them outside the body. The dendritic cells are activated in the presence of tumor antigens, which may be a single tumor-specific peptide/protein or a tumor [[cell lysate]] (a solution of broken-down tumor cells). These cells (with optional adjuvants) are infused and provoke an immune response.\n\nDendritic cell therapies include the use of antibodies that bind to receptors on the surface of dendritic cells. Antigens can be added to the antibody and can induce the dendritic cells to mature and provide immunity to the tumor. Dendritic cell receptors such as [[TLR3]], [[TLR7]], [[TLR8]] or [[CD40]] have been used as antibody targets.<ref name=\"pmid23890062\" /> Dendritic cell-NK cell interface also has an important role in immunotherapy. The design of new dendritic cell-based vaccination strategies should also encompass NK cell-stimulating potency. It is critical to systematically incorporate NK cells monitoring as an outcome in antitumor DC-based clinical trials.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}\n\n==== Drugs ====\nSipuleucel-T (Provenge) was approved for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant [[prostate cancer]] in 2010.

It is an evolution of [[Chimeric antigen receptor T cell|CAR T cell]] therapy. T cells are extracted from the patient and mixed with a genetically engineered virus that contains a cancer targeting gene (as with CAR T). The mixture is then added to a MASTER (scaffold), which absorbs them. The MASTER contains [[antibodies]] that activate the T cells and [[interleukins]] that trigger cell proliferation. The MASTER is then implanted into the patient. The activated T cells interact with the viruses to become CAR T cells. The interleukins stimulate these CAR T cells to proliferate, and the CAR T cells exit the MASTER to attack the cancer. The technique takes hours instead of weeks.

Different sources of antibodies can provoke different kinds of immune responses. For example, the human immune system can recognize mouse antibodies (also known as murine antibodies) and trigger an immune response against them. This could reduce the effectiveness of the antibodies as a treatment and cause an immune reaction. Chimeric antibodies attempt to reduce murine antibodies' [[immunogenicity]] by replacing part of the antibody with the corresponding human counterpart. Humanized antibodies are almost completely human; only the [[complementarity determining regions]] of the [[variable region]]s are derived from murine sources.

Antibodies are formed of a binding region (Fab) and the Fc region that can be detected by immune system cells via their [[Fc receptor|Fc surface receptors]]. Fc receptors are found on many immune system cells, including NK cells. When NK cells encounter antibody-coated cells, the latter's Fc regions interact with their Fc receptors, releasing [[perforin]] and [[granzyme B]] to kill the tumor cell.

Generally, the system deals with foreign pathogens but can be activated with therapeutic antibodies in cancer. The system can be triggered if the antibody is chimeric, humanized, or human; as long as it contains the [[IgG1]] [[Fc region]]. Complement can lead to cell death by activation of the [[membrane attack complex]], known as complement-dependent [[cytotoxicity]]; enhancement of [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]; and CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity occurs when antibodies bind to the cancer cell surface, the C1 complex binds to these antibodies and subsequently, protein pores are formed in cancer [[cell membrane]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gelderman KA, Tomlinson S, Ross GD, Gorter A | title = Complement function in mAb-mediated cancer immunotherapy | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 158\u201364 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15036044 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2004.01.008 }}</ref>\n\n'''Blocking'''\n\nAntibody therapies can also function by binding to proteins and physically blocking them from interacting with other proteins. Checkpoint inhibitors (CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1) operate by this mechanism. Briefly, checkpoint inhibitors are proteins that normally help to slow immune responses and prevent the immune system from attacking normal cells. Checkpoint inhibitors bind these proteins and prevent them from functioning normally, which increases the activity of the immune system.

These mutations potentially create new targetable antigens (neoantigens) for use in T-cell immunotherapy. The presence of CD8+ T cells in cancer lesions, as identified using RNA sequencing data, is higher in tumors with a high [[Tumor Mutational Burden|mutational burden]]. The level of transcripts associated with the cytolytic activity of natural killer cells and T cells positively correlates with mutational load in many human tumors. In non\u2013small cell lung cancer patients treated with lambrolizumab, mutational load shows a strong correlation with clinical response. In melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, the long-term benefit is also associated with a higher mutational load, although less significantly.
