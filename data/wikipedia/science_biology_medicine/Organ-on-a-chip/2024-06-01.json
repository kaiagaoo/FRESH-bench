Culture cells were grown on either side of the membrane: human alveolar epithelial cells on one side, and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells on the other.\n\nThe compartmentalization of the channels facilitates not only the flow of air as a fluid which delivers cells and nutrients to the [[apical surface]] of the epithelium, but also allows for pressure differences to exist between the middle and side channels. During normal inspiration in a human's [[breathing|respiratory cycle]], [[transpulmonary pressure|intrapleural pressure]] decreases, triggering an expansion of the alveoli. As air is pulled into the lungs, alveolar epithelium and the coupled endothelium in the capillaries are stretched. Since a vacuum is connected to the side channels, a decrease in pressure will cause the middle channel to expand, thus stretching the porous membrane and subsequently, the entire alveolar-capillary interface. The pressure-driven dynamic motion behind the stretching of the membrane, also described as a cyclic [[deformation (mechanics)|mechanical strain]] (valued at approximately 10%), significantly increases the rate of nanoparticle translocation across the porous membrane, when compared to a static version of this device, and to a Transwell culture system.\n\nIn order to fully validate the biological accuracy of a device, its whole-organ responses must be evaluated. In this instance, researchers inflicted injuries to the cells:\n\n* ''Pulmonary [[inflammation]]'': Pulmonary inflammatory responses entail a multistep strategy, but alongside an increased production of epithelial cells and an early response release of [[cytokines]], the interface should undergo an increased number of [[leukocyte]] adhesion molecules.<ref name=\"pmid19238447\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hermanns MI, Fuchs S, Bock M, Wenzel K, Mayer E, Kehe K, Bittinger F, Kirkpatrick CJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Primary human coculture model of alveolo-capillary unit to study mechanisms of injury to peripheral lung | journal = Cell and Tissue Research | volume = 336 | issue = 1 | pages = 91\u2013105 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19238447 | doi = 10.1007/s00441-008-0750-1 | s2cid = 25897300 }}</ref> In Huh's experiment, the pulmonary inflammation was simulated by introducing medium containing a potent proinflammatory mediator.

The bacteria were introduced onto the apical surface of the alveolar epithelium. Within hours, [[neutrophils]] were detected in the alveolar compartment, meaning they had transmigrated from the vascular microchannel where the porous membrane had [[phagocytosis|phagocytized]] the bacteria.\n\nAdditionally, researchers believe the potential value of this lung-on-a-chip system will aid in toxicology applications. By investigating the pulmonary response to [[nanoparticles]], researchers hope to learn more about health risks in certain environments, and correct previously oversimplified in vitro models.  Because a microfluidic lung-on-a-chip can more exactly reproduce the mechanical properties of a living human lung, its physiological responses will be quicker and more accurate than a [[Transwell culture]] system. Nevertheless, published studies admit that responses of a lung-on-a-chip do not yet fully reproduce the responses of native alveolar epithelial cells.\n\n=== Heart ===\n\nPast efforts to replicate in vivo cardiac tissue environments have proven to be challenging due to difficulties when mimicking [[contractility]] and [[electrophysiological]] responses.

For example, the large majority of passive transport of water occurs in the proximal tubule and the descending thin limb, or the active transport of [[NaCl]] largely occurs in the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb. The device's design requirements would require the [[filtration fraction]] in the glomerulus to vary between 15\u201320%, or the filtration reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule to vary between 65\u201370%, and finally the urea concentration in urine (collected at one of the two outlets of the device) to vary between 200\u2013400 mM.<ref name=\"pmid18609503\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weinberg E, Kaazempur-Mofrad M, Borenstein J | title = Concept and computational design for a bioartificial nephron-on-a-chip | journal = The International Journal of Artificial Organs | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 508\u201314 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18609503 | doi = 10.1177/039139880803100606 | s2cid = 44477687 }}</ref>\n\nOne recent report illustrates a biomimic nephron on hydrogel microfluidic devices with establishing the function of passive diffusion.<ref name=\"pmid23455642\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mu X, Zheng W, Xiao L, Zhang W, Jiang X | title = Engineering a 3D vascular network in hydrogel for mimicking a nephron | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 1612\u20138 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23455642 | doi = 10.1039/c3lc41342j }}</ref> The complex physiological function of nephron is achieved on the basis of interactions between vessels and tubules (both are hollow channels).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Eaton DC, Pooler JP | title = Vander's Renal Physiology | publisher = McGraw-Hill | date = 2009 }}</ref> However, conventional laboratory techniques usually focus on 2D structures, such as petri-dish that lacks capability to recapitulate real physiology that occurs in 3D.

However, such methods currently require manually skilled personnel and are not scalable. An artery-on-a-chip could overcome several of these limitations by accommodating an artery onto a platform which would be scalable, inexpensive and possibly automated in its manufacturing.\n\nAn organ-based microfluidic platform has been developed as a lab-on-a-chip onto which a fragile blood vessel can be fixed, allowing for determinants of resistance artery malfunctions to be studied.\n\nThe artery microenvironment is characterized by surrounding temperature, [[Smooth muscle#Contraction and relaxation basics|transmural pressure]], and [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal & abluminal]] drug concentrations. The multiple inputs from a microenvironment cause a wide range of mechanical or chemical stimuli on the [[smooth muscle cells]] (SMCs) and [[endothelial cells]] (ECs) that line the vessel's outer and luminal walls, respectively. Endothelial cells are responsible for releasing [[vasoconstriction]] and [[vasodilator]] factors, thus modifying tone. [[Vascular tone]] is defined as the degree of constriction inside a blood vessel relative to its maximum diameter.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Klabunde RE | publisher = Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins | date = 2011 | title = Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts | edition = 2nd }}</ref> [[Pathogenic]] concepts currently believe that subtle changes to this microenvironment have pronounced effects on arterial tone and can severely alter [[peripheral vascular resistance]]. The engineers behind this design believe that a specific strength lies in its ability to control and simulate [[heterogeneous]] spatiotemporal influences found within the microenvironment, whereas myography protocols have, by virtue of their design, only established [[homogeneous]] microenvironments.<ref name = oc23/>  They proved that by delivering [[phenylephrine]] through only one of the two channels providing [[superfusion]] to the outer walls, the drug-facing side constricted much more than the drug opposing side.\n\nThe artery-on-a-chip is designed for reversible implantation of the sample. The device contains a microchannel network, an artery loading area and a separate artery inspection area. There is a microchannel used for loading the artery segment, and when the loading well is sealed, it is also used as a [[perfusion]] channel, to replicate the process of nutritive delivery of arterial blood to a [[capillary]] bed in the biological tissue.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Marieb N, Hoehn K | date = 2006 | title = Human Anatomy & Physiology | edition = 7th }}</ref>  Another pair of microchannels serves to fix the two ends of the arterial segment. Finally, the last pair of microchannels is used to provide superfusion flow rates, in order to maintain the physiological and metabolic activity of the organ by delivering a constant sustaining medium over the abluminal wall. A [[thermoelectric]] heater and a [[thermoresistor]] are connected to the chip and maintain physiological temperatures at the artery inspection area.\n\nThe protocol of loading and securing the tissue sample into the inspection zone helps understand how this approach acknowledges whole organ functions. After immersing the tissue segment into the loading well, the loading process is driven by a syringe withdrawing a constant [[Discharge (hydrology)|flow rate]] of [[buffer solution]] at the far end of the loading channel. This causes the transport of the artery towards its dedicated position. This is done with closed fixation and superfusion in/outlet lines. After stopping the [[pump]], sub-atmospheric pressure is applied through one of the fixation channels. Then after sealing the loading well shut, the second fixation channel is subjected to a sub-atmospheric pressure. Now the artery is symmetrically established in the inspection area, and a transmural pressure is felt by the segment. The remaining channels are opened and constant perfusion and superfusion are adjusted using separate syringe pumps.<ref name = oc23/>\n\nVessel-on-chips have been applied to study many disease processes.

A new testing platforms based on multi-compartmental perfused systems have gained a remarkable interest in pharmacology and toxicology. It aims to provide a cell culture environment close to the in vivo situation to reproduce more reliably ''in vivo'' mechanisms or ADME processes that involve its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. Perfused in vitro systems combined with kinetic modelling are promising tools for studying in vitro the different processes involved in the toxicokinetics of xenobiotics.\n\nEfforts made toward the development of micro fabricated cell culture systems that aim to create models that replicate aspects of the human body as closely as possible and give examples that demonstrate their potential use in drug development, such as identifying synergistic drug interactions as well as simulating multi-organ metabolic interactions. Multi compartment micro fluidic-based devices, particularly those that are physical representations of physiologically based pharmacokinetic ([[PBPK]]) models that represent the mass transfer of compounds in compartmental models of the mammalian body, may contribute to improving the drug development process. Some emerging technologies have the ability to measure multiple biological processes in a co-culture of mixed cell types, cells from different parts of the body, which is suggested to provide more similarity to in Vivo models.   <ref>{{Cite web |title=FluoSphera - BIO International Convention {{!}} BIO |url=https://www.bio.org/events/bio-international-convention/exhibitor-directory/00865925 |access-date=2023-09-04 |website=www.bio.org |language=en}}</ref> \n\nMathematical pharmacokinetic (PK) models aim to estimate concentration-time profiles within each organ on the basis of the initial drug dose. Such mathematical models can be relatively simple, treating the body as a single compartment in which the drug distribution reaches a rapid equilibrium after administration. Mathematical models can be highly accurate when all parameters involved are known. Models that combine PK or [[PBPK]] models with PD models can predict the time-dependent pharmacological effects of a drug. We can nowadays predict with [[PBPK]] models the PK of about any chemical in humans, almost from first principles. These models can be either very simple, like statistical dose-response models, or sophisticated and based on systems biology, according to the goal pursued and the data available. All we need for those models are good parameter values for the molecule of interest.\n\n[[Microfluidic cell culture]] systems such as micro cell culture analogs (\u03bcCCAs) could be used in conjunction with PBPK models. These \u03bcCCAs scaled-down devices, termed also body-on-a-chip devices, can simulate multi-tissue interactions under near-physiological fluid flow conditions and with realistic tissue-to-tissue size ratios . Data obtained with these systems may be used to test and refine mechanistic hypotheses. Microfabricating devices also allows us to custom-design them and scale the organs' compartments correctly with respect to one another.\n\nBecause the device can be used with both animal and human cells, it can facilitate cross-species extrapolation. Used in conjunction with PBPK models, the devices permit an estimation of effective concentrations that can be used for studies with animal models or predict the human response. In the development of multicompartment devices, representations of the human body such as those in used PBPK models can be used to guide the device design with regard to the arrangement of chambers and fluidic channel connections to augment the drug development process, resulting in increased success in clinical trials.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Microphysiometry]]\n* [[ChIP-on-chip]]\n* [[Emulate]]\n* [[Precision cut lung slices]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiversity|Ethical medical research/Alternatives to animal testing#Biochip}}\n*[https://www.organonachip.org.uk UK Organ-on-a-Chip Technologies Network] \n*[https://h2020-orchid.eu/ EU H2020 Project (ORCHID) grant agreement No 766884, Organ-on-Chip in development]\n*[https://www.hdmt.technology/ hDMT] human organ and disease model technologies: pre-competitive non-profit, organ-on-chip research consortium, based in the Netherlands, aims for open access dissemination of research and data.\n\n[[Category:Microfluidics]]\n[[Category:Nanotechnology]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology]]\n[[Category:Tissue engineering]]"}
