However, the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th \u2013 beginning of the 20th century, to the so-called \"[[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]]\" (end of the century) period, denoted as an \"end of an epoch\" and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism, entailing the pursuit of life extension (or life-extensionism). Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist [[Elie Metchnikoff]] (1845-1916) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris, and [[Charles-\u00c9douard Brown-S\u00e9quard]] (1817-1894) -- the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Stambler I |title=A History of Life-Extensionism in the Twentieth Century|date=2014|publisher=Longevity History|isbn=978-1500818579|url=http://www.longevityhistory.com/}}</ref>\n\nSociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He cites [[Francis Bacon]] (1561\u20131626) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life, noting Bacon's novel ''[[New Atlantis]]'', wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627\u20131691), founding member of the [[Royal Society]], also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension, according to Hughes, and proposed such experiments as \"to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young\".

Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan.
