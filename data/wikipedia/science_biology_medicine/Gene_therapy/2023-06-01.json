If, for instance, a mutation in a certain gene causes the production of a dysfunctional protein resulting (usually recessively) in an inherited disease, gene therapy could be used to deliver a copy of this gene that does not contain the deleterious mutation and thereby produces a functional protein.

permanent cure for a condition, the therapeutic DNA introduced into target cells must remain functional and the cells containing the therapeutic DNA must be stable. Problems with integrating therapeutic DNA into the nuclear [[genome]] and the rapidly dividing nature of many cells prevent it from achieving long-term benefits. Patients require multiple treatments.\n* Immune response \u2013 Any time a foreign object is introduced into human tissues, the immune system is stimulated to attack the invader. Stimulating the immune system in a way that reduces gene therapy effectiveness is possible. The [[immune system]]'s enhanced response to viruses that it has seen before reduces the effectiveness to repeated treatments.\n* Problems with viral vectors \u2013 Viral vectors carry the risks of toxicity, inflammatory responses, and gene control and targeting issues.\n* Multigene disorders \u2013 Some commonly occurring disorders, such as [[heart disease]], [[high blood pressure]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[arthritis]], and [[diabetes]], are affected by variations in multiple genes, which complicate gene therapy.\n* Some therapies may breach the [[Weismann barrier]] (between soma and germ-line) protecting the testes, potentially modifying the germline, falling afoul of regulations in countries that prohibit the latter practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=The implications of Steele's soma-to-germline feedback for human gene therapy|url=http://wasdarwinwrong.com/kortho39a.htm|vauthors=Korthof G}}</ref>\n* Insertional [[mutagenesis]] \u2013 If the DNA is integrated in a sensitive spot in the genome, for example in a [[tumor suppressor gene]], the therapy could induce a [[tumor]]. This has occurred in clinical trials for [[X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency]] (X-SCID) patients, in which [[hematopoietic]] stem cells were transduced with a corrective transgene using a [[retrovirus]], and this led to the development of [[T cell leukemia]] in 3 of 20 patients.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Woods NB, Bottero V, Schmidt M, von Kalle C, Verma IM|date=April 2006|title=Gene therapy: therapeutic gene causing lymphoma|journal=Nature|volume=440|issue=7088|pages=1123|bibcode=2006Natur.440.1123W|doi=10.1038/4401123a|pmid=16641981|s2cid=4372110|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|display-authors=6|vauthors=Thrasher AJ, Gaspar HB, Baum C, Modlich U, Schambach A, Candotti F, Otsu M, Sorrentino B, Scobie L, Cameron E, Blyth K, Neil J, Abina SH, Cavazzana-Calvo M, Fischer A |date=September 2006|title=Gene therapy: X-SCID transgene leukaemogenicity|journal=Nature|volume=443|issue=7109|pages=E5-6; discussion E6-7|bibcode=2006Natur.443E...5T|doi=10.1038/nature05219|pmid=16988659|s2cid=4301764}}</ref> One possible solution is to add a functional tumor suppressor gene to the DNA to be integrated.
