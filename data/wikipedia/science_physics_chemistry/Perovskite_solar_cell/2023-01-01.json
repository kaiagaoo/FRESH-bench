Moreover, the long [[diffusion]] distance of the [[charge carriers|charge carrier]] and the high diffusivity - the rate of diffusion - allow the charge carriers to travel long distances within the perovskite solar cell, which improves the chance of it to be absorbed and converted to power.

This calculated limit sets the maximum theoretical efficiency of a solar cell using a [[P\u2013n junction|single junction]] with no other loss aside from [[radiative recombination]] in the solar cell. Based on the AM1.5G global solar spectra, the maximum power conversion efficiency is correlated to a respective bandgap, forming a parabolic relationship.\n\nThis limit is described by the equation\n\n:<math>\\eta = t_s \\times u (x_g) \\times v(f, x_g, x_c) \\times m(vx_g/x_c)\n</math>\n\nWhere\n\n:<math>x_g = V_g/V_s \\ ; \\  x_c = V_c/V_s</math>\n\nand ''u'' is the ultimate efficiency factor, and ''v'' is the ratio of open circuit voltage ''V''<sub>''op''</sub> to band-gap voltage ''V''<sub>''g''</sub>, and ''m'' is the impedance matching factor, and ''V''<sub>''c''</sub> is the thermal voltage, and ''V''<sub>''s''</sub> is the voltage equivalent of the temperature of the Sun.\n\nThe most efficient bandgap is found to be at 1.34 eV, with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 33.7%. Reaching this ideal bandgap energy can be difficult, but utilizing tunable perovskite solar cells allows for the flexibility to match this value. Further experimenting with [[multi-junction solar cell]]s allow for the Shockley-Queisser limit to be surpassed, expanding to allow photons of a broader wavelength range to be absorbed and converted, without increasing thermalization loss.\n\nThe actual band gap for [[formamidinium]] (FA) lead trihalide can be tuned as low as 1.48 eV, which is closer to the ideal bandgap energy of 1.34 eV for maximum power-conversion efficiency single junction solar cells, predicted by the Shockley Queisser Limit.

In one-step deposition, a perovskite precursor solution that is prepared by mixing lead halide and organic halide together, is directly deposited through various coating methods, such as spin coating, spraying, blade coating, and slot-die coating, to form perovskite film. One-step deposition is simple, fast, and inexpensive but it's also more challenging to control the perovskite film uniformity and quality. In the two-step deposition, the lead halide film is first deposited then reacts with organic halide to form perovskite film. The reaction takes time to complete but it can be facilitated by adding Lewis-bases or partial organic halide into lead halide precursors. In two-step deposition method, the volume expansion during the conversion of lead halide to perovskite can fill any pinholes to realize a better film quality. The vapor phase deposition processes can be categorized into [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD) and [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). PVD refers to the evaporation of a perovskite or its precursor to form a thin perovskite film on the substrate, which is free of solvent. While CVD involves the reaction of organic halide vapor with the lead halide thin film to convert it into the perovskite film. A solution-based CVD, aerosol-assisted CVD (AACVD) was also introduced to fabricate halide perovskite films, such as CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>,<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite journal |last1=Ke |first1=Chun-Ren |last2=Lewis |first2=David J. |last3=Walton |first3=Alex S. |last4=Chen |first4=Qian |last5=Spencer |first5=Ben F. |last6=Mokhtar |first6=Muhamad Z. |last7=Compean-Gonzalez |first7=Claudia L. |last8=O\u2019Brien |first8=Paul |last9=Thomas |first9=Andrew G. |last10=Flavell |first10=Wendy R. |title=Air-Stable Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Thin Films Fabricated via Aerosol-Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition from a Pseudohalide Pb(SCN)<sub>2</sub> Precursor |journal=ACS Applied Energy Materials |date=26 August 2019 |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=6012\u20136022 |doi=10.1021/acsaem.9b01124 |s2cid=201232856 |url=https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/airstable-methylammonium-lead-iodide-perovskite-thin-films-fabricated-via-aerosolassisted-chemical-vapor-deposition-from-a-pseudohalide-pbscn2-precursor(bb8437bb-509e-4b81-9c8c-07e376f19bfd).html }}</ref> CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=David J. |last2=O'Brien |first2=Paul |title=Ambient pressure aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition of (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)PbBr<sub>3</sub>, an inorganic\u2013organic perovskite important in photovoltaics |journal=Chem.

Current issues with perovskite solar cells revolve around stability, as the material is observed to degrade in standard environmental conditions, suffering drops in efficiency (''See also'' [[#Stability|Stability]]).\n\nIn 2014, [[Olga Malinkiewicz]] presented her inkjet printing manufacturing process for perovskite sheets in Boston (US) during the [[Materials Research Society|MRS]] fall meeting \u2013 for which she received MIT Technology review's innovators under 35 award.<ref>{{cite web|title=Olga Malinkiewicz {{!}} Innovators Under 35|url=http://innovatorsunder35.com/innovator/olga-malinkiewicz|website=innovatorsunder35.com|date=2015|access-date=2017-08-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802203850/http://innovatorsunder35.com/innovator/olga-malinkiewicz|archive-date=2017-08-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[University of Toronto]] also claims to have developed a low-cost [[Inkjet solar cell]] in which the perovskite raw materials are blended into a [[Nanosolar]] \u2018ink\u2019 which can be applied by an [[inkjet printing|inkjet printer]] onto glass, plastic or other [[substrate (printing)|substrate]] materials.<ref>[http://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/printable-solar-cells-just-got-little-closer/?_ga=1.195331948.1180808848.1486483274 Printable solar cells just got a little closer].

This strategy substantially reduces the quantity of expensive raw materials in the perovskite precursor ink and reduces the toxic waste production by spin coating through two key routes: minimizing precursor loss during the processing of perovskite films and enhancing the lifetime and shelf-life of the inks by suppressing aggregation of precursor colloids. A PCE of over 24% for laboratory PSCs could be achieved with a co-solvent dilution to a level as low as 0.5\u2009M. In addition, scalability of the co-solvent dilution strategy is tested via fabrication of perovskite solar modules (PSMs) with different sizes using industrial spin coating. The modules fabricated by co-solvent dilution strategy show higher PCEs and far better uniformity and reproducibility than modules prepared with conventional perovskite inks, whilst using a fraction of the precursor. Importantly, more than 70% toxic waste/solvent, perovskite raw material, and fabrication cost are projected to be reduced for module fabrication compared to the same modules made using conventional inks by industrial spin coating, and in doing so make spin coating a sustainable technique for medium scale manufacturing, for instance, for standalone modules or Si wafer-scale integration. This work shows that through judicious selection of a greener co-solvent, we can significantly reduce the usage and waste of toxic solvents and perovskite raw materials, while also simplifying fabrication and cutting costs of PSCs.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n== Physics ==\nAn important characteristic of the most commonly used perovskite system, the methylammonium lead halides, is a [[bandgap]] controllable by the halide content.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"noh\"/>\nThe materials also display a diffusion length for both holes and electrons of over one [[micron]].<ref name=\"stranks\">{{cite journal|last1=Stranks|first1=S.

Perovskite solar cells emerged from the field of dye-sensitized solar cells, so the sensitized architecture was that initially used, but over time it has become apparent that they function well, if not ultimately better, in a thin-film architecture.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite journal|last1=Eperon|first1=Giles E.|last2=Burlakov|first2=Victor M.|last3=Docampo|first3=Pablo|last4=Goriely|first4=Alain|last5=Snaith|first5=Henry J.|title=Morphological Control for High Performance, Solution-Processed Planar Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|volume=24|issue=1|pages=151\u2013157|doi=10.1002/adfm.201302090|year=2014|s2cid=96798077|url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c71608e0-a544-4d28-bb73-e87316f9191e}}</ref> More recently, some researchers also successfully demonstrated the possibility of fabricating flexible devices with perovskites,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Efficient organometal trihalide perovskite planar-heterojunction solar cells on flexible polymer substrates|journal = Nature Communications|volume = 4|doi = 10.1038/ncomms3761|first1 = Pablo|last1 = Docampo|first2 = James M.|last2 = Ball|first3 = Mariam|last3 = Darwich|first4 = Giles E.|last4 = Eperon|first5 = Henry J.|last5 = Snaith|year = 2013|pmid=24217714|page=2761|bibcode = 2013NatCo...4.2761D|doi-access = free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Low-Temperature Solution-Processed Perovskite Solar Cells with High Efficiency and Flexibility|journal = ACS Nano|date = February 25, 2014|pages = 1674\u20131680|volume = 8|issue = 2|doi = 10.1021/nn406020d|pmid = 24386933|first1 = Jingbi|last1 = You|first2 = Ziruo|last2 = Hong|first3 = Yang (Michael)|last3 = Yang|first4 = Qi|last4 = Chen|first5 = Min|last5 = Cai|first6 = Tze-Bin|last6 = Song|first7 = Chun-Chao|last7 = Chen|first8 = Shirong|last8 = Lu|first9 = Yongsheng|last9 = Liu}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Hong|date=2015|title=Pinhole-free and Surface-Nanostructured NiOx Film by Room-Temperature Solution Process for High-Performance Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with Good Stability and Reproducibility|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hong_Zhang174|journal=ACS Nano |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1503\u20131511|doi=10.1021/acsnano.5b07043|pmid=26688212}}</ref> which makes it more promising for flexible energy demand.

As such, research into perovskite recycling is crucial. One tricky component of perovskites to recycle is lead. Currently, producing 1 GW of energy using the most efficient perovskite solar cell would result in 3.5 tons of lead waste. The main strategy used right now to mitigate lead contamination is in-operation of the solar cell. Lead absorbing P,P\u2019-di(2-ethylhexyl)methanediphosphonic acid and sulfonic acid cation-exchange resin are used to prevent lead leaking from any damages the solar panels may incur during use 195.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}\n\nResearch is ongoing to discover means to reduce lead's impact beyond simply lead leakage prevention. Carboxylic acid cation-exchange resin has been found to adsorb lead ions via ion-exchange with hydrogen, and these ions can be easily released via recrystallization from adding sodium iodide to the aqueous solution. This process was found to be low-cost compared to other existing lead recycling techniques, and could theoretically be implemented commercially.<ref name=\"Chen et al 2021\">{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Bo |last2=Fei |first2=Chengbin |last3=Chen |first3=Shangshang |last4=Gu |first4=Hangyu |last5=Xiao |first5=Xun |last6=Huang |first6=Jinsong |title=Recycling lead and transparent conductors from perovskite solar modules |journal=Nature Communications |date=6 October 2021 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=5859 |doi=10.1038/s41467-021-26121-1 |pmid=34615875 |pmc=8494795 |bibcode=2021NatCo..12.5859C }}</ref>\n\nRecently, since the efficiency of the best perovskite solar-cell reached 25.5%, comparable to the best PV cells made of single-crystal silicon, it is optimistic for the perovskite PV cells to be commercial in the future.<ref>{{cite news |title=Best Research-Cell Efficiency Chart |url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html |access-date=19 November 2021 |work=NREL}}</ref> Therefore, the recycling of the lead and transparent conductors are essential for the development of perovskite PV cells since the former reduces harmful environmental impact and the latter reduces costs. The organic solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF) is used in the research to dissolve Pb and separate ITO/glass, then the carboxylic acid cation-exchange resin, in this research WAC-gel is used because of best performance, is utilized to absorb Pb ions in the DMF and release it in a form of Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. By adding NaI into the solution, PbI<sub>2</sub> can precipitate and be recycled. The recycled materials properties are analyzed in that both PbI<sub>2</sub> and ITO/glass have the same performance as the new ones do, and the recycling efficiency reached 99.2%.<ref name=\"Chen et al 2021\"/> Moreover, the cost analysis shows that solar modules based on recycling cost around $12 per square meter, whereas those based on new materials cost around $24.8 per square meter.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Cost Analysis of Perovskite Tandem Photovoltaics |journal=Joule |date=2018-05-24|doi=10.1016/j.joule.2018.05.001 |last1=Li |first1=Zongqi |last2=Zhao|first2=Yingzhi |last3=Wang |first3=Xi |last4=Li |first4=Yujing |last5=Zhou |first5=Huanping|last6=Chen |first6=Qi|volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=1559\u20131572 |s2cid=234153396 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Therefore, it is beneficial to recycle the perovskite PV cells from both environmental and economical perspectives.\n\n== Hysteretic current-voltage behavior ==\nAnother major challenge for perovskite solar cells is the observation that current-voltage scans yield ambiguous efficiency values.<ref name=\"hyst1\">{{cite journal|\nlast1=Snaith|first1=Henry J.|\nlast2=Abate|first2=Antonio |\nlast3=Ball|first3=James M.|\nlast4=Eperon |first4=Giles E.|\nlast5=Leijtens |first5=Tomas |\nlast6=Noel |first6=Nakita K.|\nlast7=Wang |first7=Jacob Tse-Wei|\nlast8=Wojciechowski |first8=Konrad |\nlast9=Zhang |first9=Wei|last10=Zhang|first10=Wei|\ntitle=Anomalous Hysteresis in Perovskite Solar Cells |\njournal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters |\nvolume=5|\nissue=9\n|pages=1511\u20131515|\ndoi=10.1021/jz500113x|pmid=26270088|year=2014}}\n</ref><ref name=\"hyst2\">{{cite journal|\nlast1=Unger|first1=Eva L.|\nlast2=Hoke|first2=Eric T. |\nlast3=Bailie|first3=Colin D.|\nlast4=Nguyen |first4=William H.|\nlast5=Bowring |first5=Andrea R. |\nlast6=Heumuller |first6=Thomas|\nlast7=Christoforo |first7=Mark G.|\nlast8=McGehee |first8=Michael D. |\ntitle=Hysteresis and transient behavior in current-voltage measurements of hybrid-perovskite absorber solar cells |\njournal=Energy & Environmental Science|volume=7|issue=11|pages=3690\u20133698|doi=10.1039/C4EE02465F|year=2014}}\n</ref>\nThe [[Solar cell efficiency|power conversion efficiency]] of a solar cell is usually determined by characterizing its [[Current\u2013voltage characteristic|current-voltage (IV) behavior]] under simulated solar illumination. In contrast to other solar cells, however, it has been observed that the IV-curves of perovskite solar cells show a [[hysteresis|hysteretic]] behavior: depending on scanning conditions \u2013 such as scan direction, scan speed, light soaking, biasing \u2013 there is a discrepancy between the scan from forward-bias to short-circuit (FB-SC) and the scan from short-circuit to forward bias (SC-FB).<ref name=\"hyst1\" /> Various causes have been proposed such as [[ion]] movement, [[Ionic polarization|polarization]], [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectric effects]], filling of [[Deep-level trap|trap states]],<ref name=\"hyst2\" /> however, the exact origin for the hysteretic behavior is yet to be determined. But it appears that determining the solar cell efficiency from IV-curves risks producing inflated values if the scanning parameters exceed the time-scale which the perovskite system requires in order to reach an electronic [[Steady state (electronics)|steady-state]]. Two possible solutions have been proposed: Unger et al. show that extremely slow voltage-scans allow the system to settle into steady-state conditions at every measurement point which thus eliminates any discrepancy between the FB-SC and the SC-FB scan.<ref name=\"hyst2\" />\n\n[[Henry Snaith]] et al. have proposed 'stabilized power output' as a metric for the efficiency of a solar cell. This value is determined by holding the tested device at a constant voltage around the maximum power-point (where the product of voltage and photocurrent reaches its maximum value) and track the power-output until it reaches a constant value.\nBoth methods have been demonstrated to yield lower efficiency values when compared to efficiencies determined by fast IV-scans.<ref name=\"hyst1\" /><ref name=\"hyst2\" /> However, initial studies have been published that show that surface passivation of the perovskite absorber is an avenue with which efficiency values can be stabilized very close to fast-scan efficiencies.<ref name=\"noe1l\">{{cite journal|\nlast1=Noel|first1=Nakita K|title=Enhanced Photoluminescence and Solar Cell Performance via ''Lewis'' Base Passivation of Organic\u2013Inorganic Lead Halide Perovskites|\nlast2=Abate|first2=Antonio |\nlast3=Stranks|first3=Samuel D.|\nlast4=Parrott |first4=Elizabeth S.|\nlast5=Burlakov |first5=Victor M. |\nlast6=Goriely |first6=Alain|\nlast7=Snaith |first7=Henry J.| author-link7 = Henry Snaith|\njournal=ACS Nano |volume=8|issue=10|pages=9815\u20139821|doi=10.1021/nn5036476|pmid=25171692|year=2014}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Abate|first1=Antonio|last2=Saliba|first2=Michael|last3=Hollman|first3=Derek J.|last4=Stranks|first4=Samuel D.|last5=Wojciechowski|first5=Konrad|last6=Avolio|first6=Roberto|last7=Grancini|first7=Giulia|last8=Petrozza|first8=Annamaria|last9=Snaith|author-link9=Henry Snaith|first9=Henry J.|title=Supramolecular Halogen Bond Passivation of Organic\u2013Inorganic Halide Perovskite Solar Cells|journal=Nano Letters|date=June 11, 2014|volume=14|issue=6|pages=3247\u20133254|doi=10.1021/nl500627x|pmid=24787646|bibcode=2014NanoL..14.3247A}}</ref>\nNo obvious hysteresis of photocurrent was observed by changing the sweep rates or the direction in devices or the sweep rates. This indicates that the origin of hysteresis in photocurrent is more likely due to the trap formation in some non optimized films and device fabrication processes. The ultimate way to examine the efficiency of a solar cell device is to measure its power output at the load point. If there is large density of traps in the devices or photocurrent hysteresis for other reasons, the photocurrent would rise slowly upon turning on illumination<ref name=\"inverted\">{{cite journal|\nlast1=Xiao|first1=Zhengguo|\nlast2=Bi|first2=Cheng |\nlast3=Shao|first3=Yuchuan|\nlast4=Dong |first4=Qingfeng|\nlast5=Wang |first5=Qi |\nlast6=Yuan |first6=Yongbo|\nlast7=Wang |first7=Chenggong|\nlast8=Gao| first8=Yongli|\nlast9=Huang | first9=Jinsong|s2cid=16131043|\ntitle=Efficient, High Yield Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices Grown by Interdiffusion of Solution-Processed Precursor Stacking Layers|\njournal=Energy & Environmental Science |volume=7|issue=8|page=2619|doi=10.1039/c4ee01138d|year=2014}}\n</ref> This suggests that the interfaces might play a crucial role with regards to the hysteretic IV behavior since the major difference of the inverted architecture to the regular architectures is that an organic n-type contact is used instead of a metal oxide.\n\nThe observation of hysteretic current-voltage characteristics has thus far been largely underreported. Only a small fraction of publications acknowledge the hysteretic behavior of the described devices, even fewer articles show slow non-hysteretic IV curves or stabilized power outputs. Reported efficiencies, based on rapid IV-scans, have to be considered fairly unreliable and make it currently difficult to genuinely assess the progress of the field.\n\nThe ambiguity in determining the solar cell efficiency from current-voltage characteristics due to the observed hysteresis has also affected the certification by accredited laboratories such as [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory#National Center for Photovoltaics|NREL]].
