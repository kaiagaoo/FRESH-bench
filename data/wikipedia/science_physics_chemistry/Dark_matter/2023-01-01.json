In particular, in the early universe, ordinary matter was ionized and interacted strongly with radiation via [[Thomson scattering]]. Dark matter does not interact directly with radiation, but it does affect the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by its gravitational potential (mainly on large scales) and by its effects on the density and velocity of ordinary matter. Ordinary and dark matter perturbations, therefore, evolve differently with time and leave different imprints on the CMB.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background is very close to a perfect blackbody but contains very small temperature anisotropies of a few parts in 100,000. A sky map of anisotropies can be decomposed into an angular power spectrum, which is observed to contain a series of acoustic peaks at near-equal spacing but different heights.\nThe series of peaks can be predicted for any assumed set of cosmological parameters by modern computer codes such as [[CMBFAST]] and [[CAMB]], and matching theory to data, therefore, constrains cosmological parameters.<ref name=\"Wayne Hu\">The details are technical.

These are predicted to arise in the Lambda-CDM model due to acoustic oscillations in the photon\u2013baryon fluid of the early universe, and can be observed in the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum. BAOs set up a preferred length scale for baryons. As the dark matter and baryons clumped together after recombination, the effect is much weaker in the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe, but is detectable as a subtle (\u22481&nbsp;percent) preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147&nbsp;Mpc, compared to those separated by 130\u2013160&nbsp;Mpc. This feature was predicted theoretically in the 1990s and then discovered in 2005, in two large galaxy redshift surveys, the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] and the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].<ref>\n{{Cite journal |last1=Percival |first1=W.J. |display-authors=etal |year=2007 |title=Measuring the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=381 |issue=3 |pages=1053\u20131066 |arxiv=0705.3323 |bibcode=2007MNRAS.381.1053P |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12268.x}}</ref> Combining the CMB observations with BAO measurements from galaxy [[redshift survey]]s provides a precise estimate of the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]] and the average matter density in the Universe.<ref name=\"Komatsu2009\">{{Cite journal |last1=Komatsu |first1=E. |display-authors=etal |year=2009 |title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Observations: Cosmological Interpretation |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement|volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=330\u2013376 |arxiv=0803.0547 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..330K |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/330|s2cid=119290314 }}</ref> The results support the Lambda-CDM model.\n\n=== Redshift-space distortions ===\nLarge galaxy [[redshift survey]]s may be used to make a three-dimensional map of the galaxy distribution. These maps are slightly distorted because distances are estimated from observed [[redshift]]s; the redshift contains a contribution from the galaxy's so-called peculiar velocity in addition to the dominant Hubble expansion term. On average, superclusters are expanding more slowly than the cosmic mean due to their gravity, while voids are expanding faster than average. In a redshift map, galaxies in front of a supercluster have excess radial velocities towards it and have redshifts slightly higher than their distance would imply, while galaxies behind the supercluster have redshifts slightly low for their distance. This effect causes superclusters to appear squashed in the radial direction, and likewise voids are stretched. Their angular positions are unaffected. This effect is not detectable for any one structure since the true shape is not known, but can be measured by averaging over many structures. It was predicted quantitatively by Nick Kaiser in 1987, and first decisively measured in 2001 by the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peacock |first1=J. |display-authors=etal |title=A measurement of the cosmological mass density from clustering in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey |journal=Nature |year=2001 |volume=410 |issue=6825 |pages=169\u2013173 |arxiv=astro-ph/0103143 |bibcode=2001Natur.410..169P |doi=10.1038/35065528 |pmid=11242069|s2cid=1546652 }}</ref> Results are in agreement with the [[Lambda-CDM model]].\n\n=== Lyman-alpha forest ===\n{{Main|Lyman-alpha forest}}\nIn [[astronomical spectroscopy]], the Lyman-alpha forest is the sum of the [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] arising from the [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]] transition of [[Hydrogen line|neutral hydrogen]] in the spectra of distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s.

Losing energy would be essential for object formation, because a particle that gains energy during compaction or falling \"inward\" under gravity, and cannot lose it any other way, will heat up and increase [[velocity]] and [[momentum]]. Dark matter appears to lack a means to lose energy, simply because it is not capable of interacting strongly in other ways except through gravity. The [[virial theorem]] suggests that such a particle would not stay bound to the gradually forming object \u2013 as the object began to form and compact, the dark matter particles within it would speed up and tend to escape.\n;It lacks a range of interactions needed to form structures<ref name=\"siegel\" />\n:Ordinary matter interacts in many different ways, which allows the matter to form more complex structures. For example, stars form through gravity, but the particles within them interact and can emit energy in the form of [[neutrino]]s and [[electromagnetic radiation]] through [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] when they become energetic enough. [[Proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can bind via the [[strong interaction]] and then form [[atom]]s with [[electron]]s largely through [[electromagnetic interaction]]. There is no evidence that dark matter is capable of such a wide variety of interactions, since it seems to only interact through gravity (and possibly through some means no stronger than the [[weak interaction]], although until dark matter is better understood, this is only speculation).\n\nIn 2015\u20132017, the idea that dense dark matter was composed of [[primordial black hole]]s made a comeback<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Adrian |title=Is dark matter made of black holes? |journal=Science |date=9 February 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.aal0721}}</ref> following results of [[gravitational wave]] measurements which detected the merger of intermediate-mass black holes. Black holes with about 30&nbsp;solar masses are not predicted to form by either stellar collapse (typically less than 15&nbsp;solar masses) or by the merger of black holes in galactic centers (millions or billions of solar masses). It was proposed that the intermediate-mass black holes causing the detected merger formed in the hot dense early phase of the universe due to denser regions collapsing. A later survey of about a thousand supernovae detected no gravitational lensing events, when about eight would be expected if intermediate-mass primordial black holes above a certain mass range accounted for the majority of dark matter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://astronomy.com/news/2018/10/can-black-holes-explain-dark-matter |title=Black holes can't explain dark matter |publisher=astronomy.com |date=18 October 2018 |access-date=7 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe possibility that atom-sized primordial black holes account for a significant fraction of dark matter was ruled out by measurements of positron and electron fluxes outside the Sun's heliosphere by the Voyager&nbsp;1 spacecraft.

The best candidate for hot dark matter is a neutrino ...

Such particles are termed \"warm dark matter\", because they have lower thermal velocities than massive neutrinos ... there are at present few candidate particles which fit this description.

Standard physical cosmology gives the [[particle horizon]] size as 2&nbsp;''c&nbsp;t'' (speed of light multiplied by time) in the radiation-dominated era, thus 2&nbsp;light-years. A region of this size would expand to 2&nbsp;million light-years today (absent structure formation). The actual FSL is approximately 5&nbsp;times the above length, since it continues to grow slowly as particle velocities decrease inversely with the scale factor after they become non-relativistic. In this example the FSL would correspond to 10&nbsp;million light-years, or 3&nbsp;mega[[parsec]]s, today, around the size containing an average large galaxy.\n\nThe 2.7&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[Kelvin (unit)|K]] photon temperature gives a typical photon energy of 250&nbsp;electronvolts, thereby setting a typical mass scale for warm dark matter: particles much more massive than this, such as GeV\u2013TeV mass [[weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]], would become non-relativistic much earlier than one year after the Big Bang and thus have FSLs much smaller than a protogalaxy, making them cold. Conversely, much lighter particles, such as neutrinos with masses of only a few eV, have FSLs much larger than a protogalaxy, thus qualifying them as hot.\n\n==== Cold dark matter ====\n{{Main|Cold dark matter}}\n[[Cold dark matter]] offers the simplest explanation for most cosmological observations.

Predictions based on warm dark matter are similar to those for cold dark matter on large scales, but with less small-scale density perturbations. This reduces the predicted abundance of dwarf galaxies and may lead to lower density of dark matter in the central parts of large galaxies. Some researchers consider this a better fit to observations. A challenge for this model is the lack of particle candidates with the required mass \u2248&nbsp;300&nbsp;eV to 3000&nbsp;eV.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nNo known particles can be categorized as warm dark matter. A postulated candidate is the [[sterile neutrino]]: A heavier, slower form of neutrino that does not interact through the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], unlike other neutrinos. Some modified gravity theories, such as [[scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity]], require \"warm\" dark matter to make their equations work.\n\n==== Hot dark matter ====\n{{Main|Hot dark matter}}\n[[Hot dark matter]] consists of particles whose FSL is much larger than the size of a protogalaxy. The [[neutrino]] qualifies as such particle. They were discovered independently, long before the hunt for dark matter: they were postulated in 1930, and [[Cowan\u2013Reines neutrino experiment|detected in 1956]]. Neutrinos' [[Neutrino mass|mass]] is less than 10{{sup|\u22126}} that of an [[electron]]. Neutrinos interact with normal matter only via gravity and the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], making them difficult to detect (the weak force only works over a small distance, thus a neutrino triggers a weak force event only if it hits a nucleus head-on). This makes them \u201c[[WISP (particle physics)|weakly interacting slender particles]]\u201d ([[WISP (particle physics)|WISP]]s), as opposed to WIMPs.\n\nThe three known [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavours]] of neutrinos are the ''electron'', ''muon'', and ''tau''. Their masses are slightly different. Neutrinos oscillate among the flavours as they move. It is hard to determine an exact [[Upper and lower bounds|upper bound]] on the collective average mass of the three neutrinos (or for any of the three individually). For example, if the average neutrino mass were over 50&nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]]/c{{sup|2}} (less than 10{{sup|\u22125}} of the mass of an electron), the universe would collapse. <ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Huaiyu |last2=Fuller |first2=George M. |last3=Qian |first3=Yong-Zhong |date=2010-11-23 |title=Collective Neutrino Oscillations |url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.nucl.012809.104524 |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |language=en |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=569\u2013594 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.012809.104524 |arxiv=1001.2799 |bibcode=2010ARNPS..60..569D |s2cid=118656162 |issn=0163-8998}}</ref> CMB data and other methods indicate that their average mass probably does not exceed 0.3&nbsp;eV/c{{sup|2}}.

Examples of underground laboratories with direct detection experiments include the [[Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory|Stawell mine]], the [[Soudan mine]], the [[SNOLAB]] underground laboratory at [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], the [[Gran Sasso National Laboratory]], the [[Canfranc Underground Laboratory]], the [[Boulby Underground Laboratory]], the [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]] and the [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory]].\n\nThese experiments mostly use either cryogenic or noble liquid detector technologies. Cryogenic detectors operating at temperatures below 100&nbsp;mK, detect the heat produced when a particle hits an atom in a crystal absorber such as [[germanium]]. [[Noble gas|Noble liquid]] detectors detect [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] produced by a particle collision in liquid [[xenon]] or [[argon]]. Cryogenic detector experiments include: [[Cryogenic Dark Matter Search|CDMS]], [[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers|CRESST]], [[EDELWEISS]], [[European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array|EURECA]]. Noble liquid experiments include [[LZ experiment|LZ]], [[XENON]], [[DEAP]], [[ArDM]], [[WIMP Argon Programme|WARP]], [[DarkSide (dark matter experiment)|DarkSide]], [[PandaX]], and LUX, the [[Large Underground Xenon experiment]]. Both of these techniques focus strongly on their ability to distinguish background particles (which predominantly scatter off electrons) from dark matter particles (that scatter off nuclei). Other experiments include [[SIMPLE (dark matter)|SIMPLE]] and [[PICASSO (dark matter)|PICASSO]].\n\nCurrently there has been no well-established claim of dark matter detection from a direct detection experiment, leading instead to strong upper limits on the mass and interaction cross section with nucleons of such dark matter particles.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Drees |first1=M. |last2=Gerbier |first2=G. |title=Dark Matter |journal=Chin.
