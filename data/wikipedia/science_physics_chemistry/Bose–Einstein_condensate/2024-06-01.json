On the critical region it is possible to define a critical temperature and thermal wavelength:\n\n: <math>\\lambda_c^3 = g_{3/2}(1)v = \\zeta(3/2) v,</math>\n\n: <math>T_\\text{c} = \\frac{2\\pi \\hbar^2}{m k_\\text{B} \\lambda_c^2},</math>\n\nrecovering the value indicated on the previous section. The critical values are such that if <math>T < T_\\text{c}</math> or <math>\\lambda > \\lambda_\\text{c}</math>, we are in the presence of a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate.\nUnderstanding what happens with the fraction of particles on the fundamental level is crucial. As so, write the equation of state for <math>f = 1</math>, obtaining\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\langle n_0\\rangle}{N} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_\\text{c}}{\\lambda}\\right)^3</math> and equivalently <math>\\frac{\\langle n_0\\rangle}{N} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_\\text{c}}\\right)^{3/2}.</math>\n\nSo, if <math>T \\ll T_\\text{c}</math>, the fraction <math>\\frac{\\langle n_0 \\rangle}{N} \\approx 1</math>, and if <math>T \\gg T_\\text{c}</math>, the fraction <math>\\frac{\\langle n_0 \\rangle}{N} \\approx 0</math>. At temperatures near to absolute 0, particles tend to condense in the fundamental state, which is the state with momentum <math>\\vec{p} = 0</math>.\n\n== Models ==\n\n=== Bose Einstein's non-interacting gas ===\n{{Main|Bose gas}}\nConsider a collection of ''N'' non-interacting particles, which can each be in one of two [[quantum state]]s, <math>|0\\rangle</math> and <math>|1\\rangle</math>. If the two states are equal in energy, each different configuration is equally likely.\n\nIf we can tell which particle is which, there are <math>2^N</math> different configurations, since each particle can be in <math>|0\\rangle</math> or <math>|1\\rangle</math> independently. In almost all of the configurations, about half the particles are in <math>|0\\rangle</math> and the other half in <math>|1\\rangle</math>. The balance is a statistical effect: the number of configurations is largest when the particles are divided equally.\n\nIf the particles are indistinguishable, however, there are only ''N''+1 different configurations. If there are ''K'' particles in state <math>|1\\rangle</math>, there are {{nowrap|''N \u2212 K''}} particles in state <math>|0\\rangle</math>. Whether any particular particle is in state <math>|0\\rangle</math> or in state <math>|1\\rangle</math> cannot be determined, so each value of ''K'' determines a unique quantum state for the whole system.\n\nSuppose now that the energy of state <math>|1\\rangle</math> is slightly greater than the energy of state <math>|0\\rangle</math> by an amount ''E''. At temperature ''T'', a particle will have a lesser probability to be in state <math>|1\\rangle</math> by <math>e^{-E/kT}</math>. In the distinguishable case, the particle distribution will be biased slightly towards state <math>|0\\rangle</math>. But in the indistinguishable case, since there is no statistical pressure toward equal numbers, the most-likely outcome is that most of the particles will collapse into state <math>|0\\rangle</math>.\n\nIn the distinguishable case, for large ''N'', the fraction in state <math>|0\\rangle</math> can be computed. It is the same as flipping a coin with probability proportional to ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;exp(\u2212''E''/''T'') to land tails.\n\nIn the indistinguishable case, each value of ''K'' is a single state, which has its own separate Boltzmann probability. So the probability distribution is exponential:\n\n:<math>\\,\nP(K)= C e^{-KE/T} = C p^K.\n</math>\n\nFor large ''N'', the normalization constant ''C'' is {{nowrap|(1 \u2212 ''p'')}}. The expected total number of particles not in the lowest energy state, in the limit that <math>N\\rightarrow \\infty</math>, is equal to\n: <math>\\sum_{n>0} C n p^n=p/(1-p) </math>\nIt does not grow when ''N'' is large; it just approaches a constant. This will be a negligible fraction of the total number of particles. So a collection of enough Bose particles in thermal equilibrium will mostly be in the ground state, with only a few in any excited state, no matter how small the energy difference.\n\nConsider now a gas of particles, which can be in different momentum states labeled <math>|k\\rangle</math>. If the number of particles is less than the number of thermally accessible states, for high temperatures and low densities, the particles will all be in different states. In this limit, the gas is classical. As the density increases or the temperature decreases, the number of accessible states per particle becomes smaller, and at some point, more particles will be forced into a single state than the maximum allowed for that state by statistical weighting. From this point on, any extra particle added will go into the ground state.\n\nTo calculate the transition temperature at any density, integrate, over all momentum states, the expression for maximum number of excited particles, {{nowrap|''p''/(1 \u2212 ''p'')}}:\n\n:<math>\\,\n N = V \\int {d^3k \\over (2\\pi)^3} {p(k)\\over 1-p(k)} = V \\int {d^3k \\over (2\\pi)^3} {1 \\over e^{k^2\\over 2mT}-1} </math>\n:<math>\\,\np(k)= e^{-k^2\\over 2mT}.\n</math>\n\nWhen the integral (also known as [[Bose\u2013Einstein integral]]) is evaluated with factors of <math>k_B</math> and \u210f restored by dimensional analysis, it gives the critical temperature formula of the preceding section. Therefore, this integral defines the critical temperature and particle number corresponding to the conditions of negligible [[chemical potential]] <math>\\mu</math>. In [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] distribution, <math>\\mu</math> is actually still nonzero for BECs; however, <math>\\mu</math> is less than the ground state energy. Except when specifically talking about the ground state, <math>\\mu</math> can be approximated for most energy or momentum states as&nbsp;<math>\\mu \\approx 0</math>.\n\n=== Bogoliubov theory for weakly interacting gas ===\n[[Nikolay Bogolyubov|Nikolay Bogoliubov]] considered perturbations on the limit of dilute gas,<ref name=Bogoliubov:1947/> finding a finite pressure at zero temperature and positive chemical potential. This leads to corrections for the ground state. The Bogoliubov state has pressure (''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0): <math>P = gn^2/2</math>.\n\nThe original interacting system can be converted to a system of non-interacting particles with a dispersion law.\n\n=== Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation ===\n{{Main|Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation}}\n\nIn some simplest cases, the state of condensed particles can be described with a nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, also known as Gross\u2013Pitaevskii or Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation. The validity of this approach is actually limited to the case of ultracold temperatures, which fits well for the most alkali atoms experiments.\n\nThis approach originates from the assumption that the state of the BEC can be described by the unique wavefunction of the condensate <math>\\psi(\\vec{r})</math>. For a [[Schr\u00f6dinger field|system of this nature]], <math>|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^2</math> is interpreted as the particle density, so the total number of atoms is <math>N=\\int d\\vec{r}|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^2</math>\n\nProvided essentially all atoms are in the condensate (that is, have condensed to the ground state), and treating the bosons using [[mean-field theory]], the energy (E) associated with the state <math>\\psi(\\vec{r})</math> is:\n\n:<math>E=\\int\nd\\vec{r}\\left[\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}|\\nabla\\psi(\\vec{r})|^2+V(\\vec{r})|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^2+\\frac{1}{2}U_0|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^4\\right]</math>\n\nMinimizing this energy with respect to infinitesimal variations in <math>\\psi(\\vec{r})</math>, and holding the number of atoms constant, yields the Gross\u2013Pitaevski equation (GPE) (also a non-linear [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]):\n\n:<math>i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial \\psi(\\vec{r})}{\\partial t} = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2\\nabla^2}{2m}+V(\\vec{r})+U_0|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^2\\right)\\psi(\\vec{r})</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n:{|cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n| <math>\\,m</math>\n| &nbsp;is the mass of the bosons,\n|-\n| <math>\\,V(\\vec{r})</math>\n| &nbsp;is the external potential, and\n|-\n| <math>\\,U_0</math>\n| &nbsp;represents the inter-particle interactions.\n|}\n\nIn the case of zero external potential, the dispersion law of interacting Bose\u2013Einstein-condensed particles is given by so-called Bogoliubov spectrum (for <math>\\ T= 0</math>):\n\n:<math> {\\omega _p} = \\sqrt {\\frac{{{p^2}}}{{2m}}\\left( {\\frac{{{p^2}}}{{2m}} + 2{U_0}{n_0}} \\right)} </math>\n\nThe Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) provides a relatively good description of the behavior of atomic BEC's. However, GPE does not take into account the temperature dependence of dynamical variables, and is therefore valid only for <math>\\ T= 0</math>.\nIt is not applicable, for example, for the condensates of excitons, magnons and photons, where the critical temperature is comparable to room temperature.\n\n== Numerical solution ==\nThe Gross-Pitaevskii equation is a partial differential equation in space and time variables.

This problem was solved in 1977 by Peletminskii et al. in microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations are valid for any finite temperatures below the critical point. Years after, in 1985, Kirkpatrick and Dorfman obtained similar equations using another microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations also reproduce Khalatnikov hydrodynamical equations for superfluid as a limiting case.\n\n=== Superfluidity of BEC and Landau criterion ===\nThe phenomena of superfluidity of a Bose gas and superconductivity of a strongly-correlated Fermi gas (a gas of Cooper pairs) are tightly connected to Bose\u2013Einstein condensation. Under corresponding conditions, below the temperature of phase transition, these phenomena were observed in [[helium-4]] and different classes of superconductors. In this sense, the superconductivity is often called the superfluidity of Fermi gas. In the simplest form, the origin of superfluidity can be seen from the weakly interacting bosons model.\n\n== Experimental observation ==\n\n=== Superfluid helium-4 ===\n{{Main article|Superfluid helium-4}}\nIn 1938, [[Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa|Pyotr Kapitsa]], [[John F. Allen (physicist)|John Allen]] and [[Don Misener]] discovered that [[helium-4]] became a new kind of fluid, now known as a [[superfluid]], at temperatures less than 2.17 K (the [[lambda point]]). Superfluid helium has many unusual properties, including zero [[viscosity]] (the ability to flow without dissipating energy) and the existence of [[quantum vortex|quantized vortices]]. It was quickly believed that the superfluidity was due to partial Bose\u2013Einstein condensation of the liquid. In fact, many properties of superfluid helium also appear in gaseous condensates created by Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle (see below). Superfluid helium-4 is a liquid rather than a gas, which means that the interactions between the atoms are relatively strong; the original theory of Bose\u2013Einstein condensation must be heavily modified in order to describe it. Bose\u2013Einstein condensation remains, however, fundamental to the superfluid properties of helium-4. Note that [[helium-3]], a [[fermion]], also enters a [[superfluid]] phase (at a much lower temperature) which can be explained by the formation of bosonic [[Cooper pairs]] of two atoms (see also [[fermionic condensate]]).\n\n=== Dilute atomic gases ===\nThe first \"pure\" Bose\u2013Einstein condensate was created by [[Eric Cornell]], [[Carl Wieman]], and co-workers at [[JILA]] on 5 June 1995.<ref name=\":0\" /> They cooled a dilute vapor of approximately two thousand [[rubidium|rubidium-87]] atoms to below 170 nK using a combination of [[laser cooling]] (a technique that won its inventors [[Steven Chu]], [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]], and [[William D. Phillips]] the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]) and [[magnetic evaporative cooling]]. About four months later, an independent effort led by [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] condensed [[sodium|sodium-23]]. Ketterle's condensate had a hundred times more atoms, allowing important results such as the observation of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between two different condensates. Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle won the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their achievements.<ref name=\"nobel\">{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/cornellwieman-lecture.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/cornellwieman-lecture.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Eric A.

Hulet|Randall Hulet]] at Rice University announced a condensate of [[lithium]] atoms only one month following the JILA work.<ref name=Bradley:1995/> Lithium has attractive interactions, causing the condensate to be unstable and collapse for all but a few atoms. Hulet's team subsequently showed the condensate could be stabilized by confinement quantum pressure for up to about 1000 atoms. Various isotopes have since been condensed.\n\n==== Velocity-distribution data graph ====\nIn the image accompanying this article, the velocity-distribution data indicates the formation of a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate out of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms. The false colors indicate the number of atoms at each velocity, with red being the fewest and white being the most. The areas appearing white and light blue are at the lowest velocities. The peak is not infinitely narrow because of the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]: spatially confined atoms have a minimum width velocity distribution. This width is given by the curvature of the magnetic potential in the given direction. More tightly confined directions have bigger widths in the ballistic velocity distribution. This [[anisotropy]] of the peak on the right is a purely quantum-mechanical effect and does not exist in the thermal distribution on the left. This graph served as the cover design for the 1999 textbook ''Thermal Physics'' by Ralph Baierlein.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/thermalphysics00ralp|url-access=registration|title=Thermal Physics|author=Baierlein, Ralph |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-65838-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Quasiparticles ===\n{{Main|Bose\u2013Einstein condensation of quasiparticles}}Bose\u2013Einstein condensation also applies to [[quasiparticle]]s in solids.

Densities from the limit of a dilute gas to a strongly interacting Bose liquid are possible. Magnetic ordering is the analog of superfluidity.

The high transition temperature (relative to atomic gases) is due to the magnons' small mass (near that of an electron) and greater achievable density.

Although solitons carry no charge and are thus prone to decay, relatively long-lived dark solitons have been produced and studied extensively.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/nphys962| issn = 1745-2481| volume = 4| issue = 6| pages = 496\u2013501| last1 = Becker| first1 = Christoph| last2 = Stellmer| first2 = Simon| last3 = Soltan-Panahi| first3 = Parvis| last4 = D\u00f6rscher| first4 = S\u00f6ren| last5 = Baumert| first5 = Mathis| last6 = Richter| first6 = Eva-Maria| last7 = Kronj\u00e4ger| first7 = Jochen| last8 = Bongs| first8 = Kai| last9 = Sengstock| first9 = Klaus| title = Oscillations and interactions of dark and dark\u2013bright solitons in Bose\u2013Einstein condensates| journal = Nature Physics| accessdate = 2021-10-27| date = 2008-05-04| arxiv = 0804.0544| bibcode = 2008NatPh...4..496B| s2cid = 119300908| url = https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys962}}</ref>\n\n=== Attractive interactions ===\nExperiments led by Randall Hulet at Rice University from 1995 through 2000 showed that lithium condensates with attractive interactions could stably exist up to a critical atom number. Quench cooling the gas, they observed the condensate to grow, then subsequently collapse as the attraction overwhelmed the zero-point energy of the confining potential, in a burst reminiscent of a supernova, with an explosion preceded by an implosion.\n\nFurther work on attractive condensates was performed in 2000 by the [[JILA]] team, of Cornell, Wieman and coworkers. Their instrumentation now had better control so they used naturally ''attracting'' atoms of rubidium-85 (having negative atom\u2013atom [[scattering length]]). Through [[Feshbach resonance]] involving a sweep of the magnetic field causing spin flip collisions, they lowered the characteristic, discrete energies at which rubidium bonds, making their Rb-85 atoms repulsive and creating a stable condensate. The reversible flip from attraction to repulsion stems from quantum [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] among wave-like condensate atoms.\n\nWhen the JILA team raised the magnetic field strength further, the condensate suddenly reverted to attraction, imploded and shrank beyond detection, then exploded, expelling about two-thirds of its 10,000 atoms. About half of the atoms in the condensate seemed to have disappeared from the experiment altogether, not seen in the cold remnant or expanding gas cloud.<ref name=nobel/> [[Carl Wieman]] explained that under current atomic theory this characteristic of Bose\u2013Einstein condensate could not be explained because the energy state of an atom near absolute zero should not be enough to cause an implosion; however, subsequent mean-field theories have been proposed to explain it. Most likely they formed molecules of two rubidium atoms;<ref name=vanPutten:2010/> energy gained by this bond imparts velocity sufficient to leave the trap without being detected.\n\nThe process of creation of molecular Bose condensate during the sweep of the magnetic field throughout the Feshbach resonance, as well as the reverse process, are described by the exactly solvable model that can explain many experimental observations.<ref name=\"sun-16pra2\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.94.033808|title=Landau-Zener extension of the Tavis-Cummings model: Structure of the solution|author1=C.
