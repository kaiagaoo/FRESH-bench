in simulation using the same RL algorithms and training code as [[#OpenAI Five|OpenAI Five]]. OpenAI tackled the object orientation problem by using [[domain randomization]], a simulation approach which exposes the learner to a variety of experiences rather than trying to fit to reality. The set-up for Dactyl, aside from having motion tracking cameras, also has [[RGB color model|RGB]] cameras to allow the robot to manipulate an arbitrary object by seeing it. In 2018, OpenAI showed that the system was able to manipulate a cube and an octagonal prism.<ref>{{cite arXiv |author=OpenAI |last2=Andrychowicz |first2=Marcin |last3=Baker |first3=Bowen |last4=Chociej |first4=Maciek |last5=J\u00f3zefowicz |first5=Rafa\u0142 |last6=McGrew |first6=Bob |last7=Pachocki |first7=Jakub |last8=Petron |first8=Arthur |last9=Plappert |first9=Matthias |last10=Powell |first10=Glenn |last11=Ray |first11=Alex |last12=Schneider |first12=Jonas |last13=Sidor |first13=Szymon |last14=Tobin |first14=Josh |last15=Welinder |first15=Peter |last16=Weng |first16=Lilian |last17=Zaremba |first17=Wojciech |year=2019 |title=Learning Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation |eprint=1808.00177v5 |class=cs.LG}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, OpenAI demonstrated that Dactyl could solve a [[Rubik's Cube]]. The robot was able to solve the puzzle 60% of the time. Objects like the Rubik's Cube introduce complex physics that is harder to model. OpenAI did this by improving the robustness of Dactyl to perturbations by using Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR), a simulation approach of generating progressively more difficult environments. ADR differs from manual domain randomization by not needing a human to specify randomization ranges.<ref>{{cite arXiv |author1=OpenAI |last2=Akkaya |first2=Ilge |last3=Andrychowicz |first3=Marcin |last4=Chociej |first4=Maciek |last5=Litwin |first5=Mateusz |last6=McGrew |first6=Bob |last7=Petron |first7=Arthur |last8=Paino |first8=Alex |last9=Plappert |first9=Matthias |last10=Powell |first10=Glenn |last11=Ribas |first11=Raphael |year=2019 |title=Solving Rubik's Cube with a Robot Hand |eprint=1910.07113v1 |class=cs.LG}}</ref>\n\n=== API ===\nIn June 2020, OpenAI announced a multi-purpose [[API]] which it said was \"for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI\" to let developers call on it for \"any English language AI task\".<ref name=\"gpt3-whynotfullmodel\" /><ref name=\"tech_Tech\">{{Cite web |date=June 11, 2020 |title=TechCrunch Startup and Technology News |url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/openai-makes-an-all-purpose-api-for-its-text-based-ai-capabilities/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612041855/https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/openai-makes-an-all-purpose-api-for-its-text-based-ai-capabilities/ |archive-date=June 12, 2020 |access-date=June 11, 2020 |work=TechCrunch |quote=If you\u2019ve ever wanted to try out OpenAI's vaunted machine learning toolset, it just got a lot easier.

This makes it hard for anyone except larger companies to benefit from the underlying technology.

These annotations were used to train an AI model to detect toxicity, which could then be used to filter out toxic content, notably from ChatGPT's training data and outputs. However, these pieces of text usually contained detailed descriptions of various types of violence, including sexual violence. The four Sama employees interviewed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described themselves as mentally scarred. OpenAI paid Sama $12.50 per hour of work, and Sama was redistributing the equivalent of between $1.32 and $2.00 per hour post-tax to its annotators.
