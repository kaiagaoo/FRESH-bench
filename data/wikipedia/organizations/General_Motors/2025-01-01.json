GMDAT suffered from cash flow issues exacerbated by a $1.5 billion loss in foreign exchange in the first quarter of 2009. GM's precarious financial situation, exacerbated by impending bankruptce, and the reluctance of the US government rescuers to address overseas issues, left few options. Facing a frozen credit market and the Korean Development Bank's refusal to extend loans beyond the existing $2 billion owed by GMDAT, GM had no alternative but to seek capital from China.<ref name=\"finance.yahoo.com\"/><ref name=\"qz.com\"/>\n\nBy mid-November 2009, GM suddenly had $491 million available for GMDAT's turnaround, though the source of the funds was initially unclear.<ref name=\"finance.yahoo.com\"/><ref name=\"qz.com\"/> It was later revealed that GM had sold a 1% stake in Shanghai GM to [[SAIC Motor]], effectively giving SAIC Motor controlling interest in the venture. Additionally, GM transformed its struggling GM India division into a joint venture, with SAIC Motor acquiring a 50% stake in exchange for a $350 million investment. GM executives stated that SAIC Motor's involvement facilitated access to Chinese banking sector funding, which would have been challenging to secure independently. In its 2010 SEC filing, GM clarified that SAIC had helped secure a $400 million commercial bank loan, using its stake in Shanghai-GM as collateral.<ref name=\"finance.yahoo.com\"/><ref name=\"qz.com\"/>\n\nIn December 2009, the \"new\" GM's [[board of directors]] asked CEO [[Fritz Henderson]] to resign, and its chairman, Ed Whitacre, was named interim CEO.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/business/02motors.html | title=G.M.

GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders. According to [[Wyndham Mortimer]], the UAW officer put in charge of the organizing campaign in Flint, he received a death threat by an anonymous caller when he visited Flint in 1936. GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants. This forced UAW members to keep the names of new members secret and meeting workers at their homes.\n\nAs the UAW studied its target, it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]] from which car body components were stamped: one in Flint that produced the parts for [[Buick]]s, [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]]s, and [[Oldsmobile]]s, and another in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] that produced [[Chevrolet]] parts.\n\n[[File:Flint Sit-Down Strike National Guard.jpg|thumb|[[US National Guard|National Guardsmen]] with machine guns overlooking Chevrolet factories number nine and number four]]\n\nWhile the UAW called for a sit-down strike in Flint, the police, armed with guns and tear gas, attempted to enter the Fisher Body 2 plant on January 11, 1937. The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges, bottles, and bolts. At the time, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John Nance Garner]] supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike, but this idea was rejected by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. The president urged GM to distinguish a union so the plants could re-open. The strike ended after 44 days.\n\nThat development forced GM to bargain with the union. [[John L. Lewis]], President of the [[United Mine Workers]] and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President [[Homer Martin (labor leader)|Homer Martin]] was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW, so Governor [[Frank Murphy]] acted as a courier and [[mediation|intermediary]] between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the [[U.S. National Guard]] not to evict the strikers but rather to protect them from the police and corporate [[strike-breaker]]s. The two parties finally reached an agreement on February 11, 1937, on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees, who were union members for the next six months.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.hourdetroit.com/community/frank-murphys-law/ | last1=Bak | first1=Richard | title=(Frank) Murphy's Law | work=[[Hour Detroit]] | date=September 2008 | archive-date=July 23, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723065533/http://www.hourdetroit.com/Hour-Detroit/September-2008/Frank-Murpheys-Law/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Tool and die strike of 1939===\n{{Main|Tool and die strike of 1939}}\n\nThe [[tool and die strike of 1939]], also known as the \"strategy strike\", was an ultimately successful attempt by the UAW to be recognized as the sole representative for General Motors workers. In addition to representation rights, the UAW, working jointly with the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO), sought to resolve existing grievances of skilled workers.\n\n=== United Auto Workers (UAW) strike of 1945\u20131946 ===\n{{Main|1945-46 United Auto Workers strike}}\n\nFrom November 21, 1945, until March 13, 1946, (113 days) the UAW organized \"320,000 hourly workers\" to form a US-wide strike against the [[General Motors Corporation]], workers used the tactic of the [[sit down strike]].<ref name=\"Barnard\">{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81th3H56WzEC | first=John | last=Barnard | title=American Vanguard: The United Auto Workers During the Reuther Years, 1935-1970 | publisher=Wayne State University Press | year=2004 | page=212| isbn=9780814329474 }}</ref> It was \"the longest strike against a major manufacturer\" that the UAW had yet seen, and it was also \"the longest national GM strike in its history\".<ref name=\"Barnard\" /> As director of the UAW's General Motors Department (coordinator of union relations with GM),<ref>Kevin Boyle.

However, the strike ended with the dissatisfaction of Walter Reuther and the UAW, and the workers received only a 17.5-percent increase in wages.\n\n===2007 General Motors strike===\n{{Main|2007 General Motors strike}}\n\nThe [[2007 General Motors strike]] was a strike from September 24 to 26, 2007, by the UAW against General Motors.\n\nOn September 24, 2007, General Motors workers represented by the UAW union went on strike against the company. The first US-wide strike against GM since 1970 was expected to idle 59 plants and facilities for an indefinite period of time. Talks broke down after more than 20 straight days of bargaining failed to produce a new contract.

To compensate for the removal of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar) as a cost-cutting measure, Corvairs required [[tire]] pressures that were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15 psi front, 26 psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30 psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was dangerous over-steer.<ref>{{cite news | last=CSERE| first=CSABA | title=General Motors Celebrates a 100-Year History of Technological Breakthroughs | url=https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15143719/general-motors-celebrates-a-100-year-history-of-technological-breakthroughs/ | work=Car and Driver |date=September 1, 2008 | archive-date=February 25, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225090611/http://www.caranddriver.com/columns/general-motors-celebrates-a-100-year-history-of-technological-breakthroughs|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn early March 1966, several media outlets, including ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', alleged that GM had tried to discredit [[Ralph Nader]], hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past, and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2005/scene_longhine_novdec05.msp |title=Ralph Nader's museum of tort law will include relics from famous lawsuits{{snd}}if it ever gets built | date=December 2005 |website=LegalAffairs.org | archive-date=March 31, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331074458/http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2005/scene_longhine_novdec05.msp |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date=May 7, 2005 | work=Federal Highway Administration |url= https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/safetyep.cfm |title=President Dwight D.
