GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders. According to [[Wyndham Mortimer]], the UAW officer put in charge of the organizing campaign in Flint, he received a death threat by an anonymous caller when he visited Flint in 1936. GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants. This forced UAW members to keep the names of new members secret and meeting workers at their homes.\n\nAs the UAW studied its target, it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]] from which car body components were stamped: one in Flint that produced the parts for [[Buick]]s, [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]]s, and [[Oldsmobile]]s, and another in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] that produced [[Chevrolet]] parts.\n\n[[File:Flint Sit-Down Strike National Guard.jpg|thumb|[[US National Guard|National Guardsmen]] with machine guns overlooking Chevrolet factories number nine and number four]]\n\nWhile the UAW called for a sit-down strike in Flint, the police, armed with guns and tear gas, attempted to enter the Fisher Body 2 plant on January 11, 1937. The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges, bottles, and bolts. At the time, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John Nance Garner]] supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike, but this idea was rejected by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. The president urged GM to distinguish a union so the plants could re-open. The strike ended after 44 days.\n\nThat development forced GM to bargain with the union. [[John L. Lewis]], President of the [[United Mine Workers]] and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President [[Homer Martin (labor leader)|Homer Martin]] was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW, so Governor [[Frank Murphy]] acted as a courier and [[mediation|intermediary]] between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the [[U.S. National Guard]] not to evict the strikers but rather to protect them from the police and corporate [[strike-breaker]]s. The two parties finally reached an agreement on February 11, 1937, on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees, who were union members for the next six months.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.hourdetroit.com/community/frank-murphys-law/ | last1=Bak | first1=Richard | title=(Frank) Murphy's Law | work=[[Hour Detroit]] | date=September 2008 | archive-date=July 23, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723065533/http://www.hourdetroit.com/Hour-Detroit/September-2008/Frank-Murpheys-Law/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Tool and die strike of 1939===\n{{Main|Tool and die strike of 1939}}\n\nThe [[tool and die strike of 1939]], also known as the \"strategy strike\", was an ultimately successful attempt by the [[United Auto Workers Union]] (UAW) to be recognized as the sole representative for General Motors workers.

The first US-wide strike against GM since 1970 was expected to idle 59 plants and facilities for an indefinite period of time. Talks broke down after more than 20 straight days of bargaining failed to produce a new contract.

To compensate for the removal of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar) as a cost-cutting measure, Corvairs required [[tire]] pressures that were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15 psi front, 26 psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30 psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was dangerous over-steer.<ref>{{cite news | last=CSERE| first=CSABA | title=General Motors Celebrates a 100-Year History of Technological Breakthroughs | url=https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15143719/general-motors-celebrates-a-100-year-history-of-technological-breakthroughs/ | work=[[Car and Driver]] | date=September 1, 2008 | archive-date=February 25, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225090611/http://www.caranddriver.com/columns/general-motors-celebrates-a-100-year-history-of-technological-breakthroughs|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn early March 1966, several media outlets, including ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', alleged that GM had tried to discredit [[Ralph Nader]], hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past, and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2005/scene_longhine_novdec05.msp |title=Ralph Nader's museum of tort law will include relics from famous lawsuits\u2014if it ever gets built | date=December 2005 |website=LegalAffairs.org | archive-date=March 31, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331074458/http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2005/scene_longhine_novdec05.msp |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date=May 7, 2005 | work=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/safetyep.cfm |title=President Dwight D.
