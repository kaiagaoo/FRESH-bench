During the 1960s and 1970s, the [[IBM mainframe]], exemplified by the [[IBM System/360|System/360]], was the dominant [[computing platform]], and the company produced 80 percent of computers in the United States and 70 percent of computers worldwide.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=IBM {{!}} Founding, History, & Products {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Business-Machines-Corporation |access-date=2022-12-30 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter pioneering the [[Microcomputer|multipurpose microcomputer]] in 1980s, which [[Influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market|set the standard for personal computers]], IBM began losing its market dominance to emerging competitors.

Since 2000, its supercomputers have [[TOP500|consistently ranked]] among the most powerful in the world, and in 2001 it became the first company to generate more than 3,000 patents in one year, beating this record in 2008 with more than 4,000 patents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs one of the world's oldest and largest technology companies, IBM has been responsible for several technological innovations, including the <!-- ALPHABETICAL ORDER, ONLY MOST NOTABLE HERE, OTHERS IN BODY OF ARTICLE-->[[automated teller machine]] (ATM), the [[floppy disk]], the [[hard disk drive]], the [[magnetic stripe card]], the [[relational model|relational database]], the [[SQL|SQL programming language]], the [[Universal Product Code|UPC barcode]], and [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM).<!-- ALPHABETICAL ORDER, ONLY MOST NOTABLE HERE, OTHERS IN BODY OF ARTICLE-->The company has made inroads in advanced computer chips, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and data infrastructure.

It offered its first commercial stored-program computer, the [[vacuum tube]] based [[IBM 701]], in 1952. The [[IBM 305 RAMAC]] introduced the [[hard disk drive]] in 1956. The company switched to transistorized designs with the [[IBM 700/7000 series|7000]] and [[IBM 1400 series|1400]] series, beginning in 1958.\n\nIn 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of [[artificial intelligence]] when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's [[Poughkeepsie]], New York, laboratory programmed an [[IBM 704]] not merely to play checkers but \"learn\" from its own experience. In 1957, the [[FORTRAN]] scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the [[Sabre (computer system)|SABRE reservation system]] for [[American Airlines]] and introduced the highly successful [[IBM Selectric typewriter|Selectric]] typewriter.\n\nIn 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flights of the Mercury astronauts. A year later, it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to [[Armonk, New York]]. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights, and 1969 lunar mission.
