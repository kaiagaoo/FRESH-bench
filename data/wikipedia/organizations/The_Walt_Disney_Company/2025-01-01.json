There have been controversies over alleged [[plagiarism]], poor pay and working conditions, and poor treatment of animals. Disney has also been criticised for filming in the autonomous region of [[Xinjiang]], where [[Xinjiang internment camps|human rights abuses are taking place]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wintour |first=Patrick |date=April 28, 2021 |title=Disney unapologetic over Mulan credit thanking Chinese Communist party |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/28/disney-unapologetic-over-mulan-credits-thanking-chinese-communist-party |access-date=August 24, 2023 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Moral partiality ===\nIn October 2023, The Walt Disney Company pledged $2 million for humanitarian relief efforts in Israel, following a series of attacks by the occupation resistance group Hamas. Disney allocated half of this donation to Magen David Adom, Israel's national emergency medical service, and the other half to various non-profit organizations supporting children in Israel. Disney CEO Bob Iger described the donation as a means of supporting innocent people in Israel, particularly children without giving any attention to the tens of thousands of Palestinian children that were killed in the conflict. However, the move sparked significant backlash from activists and critics, who argued that Disney\u2019s contributions overlooked the extensive humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where ongoing Israeli airstrikes had killed thousands of Palestinian civilians, including children, and destroyed critical infrastructure. Critics contended that Disney\u2019s selective aid sends a message that Israeli lives, particularly Israeli children's lives, are valued more than those of Palestinians. In addition to the $2 million, Disney implemented a matching gift program for employees, a decision that further fueled public outcry over the company\u2019s perceived endorsement of one side in the conflict.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bruce |date=2023-10-13 |title=The Walt Disney Company Donates To Support Humanitarian Relief Following Terrorist Attacks In Israel |url=https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-donates-to-support-humanitarian-relief-following-terrorist-attacks-in-israel/ |access-date=2024-11-12 |website=The Walt Disney Company |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Salih |first=Swara |date=December 29, 2023 |title=Has Disney alienated its Muslim viewers with its pro-Israel stance? |url=https://www.newarab.com/features/has-disney-alienated-its-muslim-viewers |work=[[The New Arab]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Snow |first=Michelle |date=2023-10-14 |title=The Walt Disney Company Donates $2 Million to Humanitarian Relief For Israel |url=https://thedisneyblog.com/2023/10/14/the-walt-disney-company-donates-2-million-to-humanitarian-relief-for-israel/ |access-date=2024-11-12 |website=The Disney Blog |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Racism ===\nSeveral of Disney's films have been considered to be racist; one of the company's most-controversial films ''[[Song of the South]]'' was criticized for portraying racial stereotypes.
