The initial launch of Creative Cloud alongside Creative Suite 5 users came at the same time that Adobe ran into controversy from users of Adobe's creative software, with users of Adobe software stating that the original perpetual and subscription pricing plans for CS5 would be unaffordable for not only individuals but also businesses, as well as refusing to extend a Creative Suite 6 discount to non-CS5 users. The original announcement of Adobe Creative Cloud was met with a positive reception from CNET journalists as a much more enticing plan, and Creative Cloud was first released in 2012, though a later CNET survey evidenced that more users had a negative perception about subscription creative software than a positive view. The original pricing plan for Creative Cloud was $75 per month for the entire suite of software, though Adobe discounted the monthly cost to $50 for users willing to commit to at least one year of continuous subscription for Creative Cloud, and down to $30 per month for former CS users with the one year commitment.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Adobe launches Creative Cloud subscription service |url=https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/adobe-launches-creative-cloud-subscription-service/ |access-date=2024-06-21 |website=CNET |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Adobe's new pricing plan: Ouch, users say |url=https://www.cnet.com/culture/adobes-new-pricing-plan-ouch-users-say/ |access-date=2024-06-21 |website=CNET |language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 2013, Adobe decided that CS6 would be the last version of Creative Suite software that would be sold through perpetual licensing option, and in May announced that a Creative Cloud subscription would be the only way to get the newest versions of Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Adobe creative software.
