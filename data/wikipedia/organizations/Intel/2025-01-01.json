However, increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had, by 1983, dramatically reduced the profitability of this market. The growing success of the [[IBM]] personal computer, based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore (CEO since 1975) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model. Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growing [[IBM PC compatible|personal computer market]], Intel embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary and most profitable hardware supplier to the PC industry, part of the winning 'Wintel' combination. Moore handed over his position as CEO to Andy Grove in 1987. By launching its Intel Inside [[marketing campaign]] in 1991, Intel was able to associate [[brand loyalty]] with consumer selection, so that by the end of the 1990s, its line of [[Pentium]] processors had become a household name.\n\n===Challenges to dominance (2000s)===\nAfter 2000, growth in demand for high-end microprocessors slowed. Competitors, most notably [[AMD]] (Intel's largest competitor in its primary [[x86]] architecture market), garnered significant market share, initially in low-end and mid-range processors but ultimately across the product range, and Intel's dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced,<ref name=\"Wong\">{{Cite news|url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/20060731/btintelchip31/intel-core-2-duo-a-big-leap-in-chip-race|title=Intel Core 2 Duo a big leap in chip race|last=Wong|first=Nicole|date=July 31, 2006|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=October 15, 2009|archive-date=December 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205030002/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060731&slug=btintelchip31|url-status=live}}</ref> mostly due to controversial [[NetBurst]] microarchitecture.

Concurrently, Intel engineers [[Marcian Hoff]], [[Federico Faggin]], [[Stanley Mazor]], and [[Masatoshi Shima]] invented Intel's first [[microprocessor]]. Originally developed for the Japanese company [[Busicom]] to replace a number of [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASICs]] in a calculator already produced by Busicom, the [[Intel 4004]] was introduced to the mass market on November 15, 1971, though the microprocessor did not become the core of Intel's business until the mid-1980s. (Note: Intel is usually given credit with [[Texas Instruments]] for the almost-simultaneous invention of the microprocessor.)\n\nIn 1983, at the dawn of the personal computer era, Intel's profits came under increased pressure from Japanese memory-chip manufacturers, and then-president Andy Grove focused the company on microprocessors. Grove described this transition in the book ''[[Only the Paranoid Survive]]''. A key element of his plan was the notion, then considered radical, of becoming the single source for successors to the popular [[Intel 8086|8086]] microprocessor.\n\nUntil then, the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier, but Grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories,{{which|date=October 2013}} and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Intel and the x86 Architecture: A Legal Perspective |url=https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/intel-and-the-x86-architecture-a-legal-perspective |access-date=17 October 2021 |date=4 January 2011 |archive-date=October 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211017024727/https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/intel-and-the-x86-architecture-a-legal-perspective |url-status=live }}</ref> When the PC industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s, Intel was one of the primary beneficiaries.\n\n===Early x86 processors and the IBM PC===\n[[File:Intel 8742 153056995.jpg|thumb|The [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] from an Intel 8742, an [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] microcontroller that includes a [[CPU]] running at 12&nbsp;MHz, 128 bytes of [[RAM]], 2048 bytes of [[EPROM]], and [[Input/output|I/O]] in the same chip]]\n\nDespite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor, the [[Intel 4004|4004]] and its successors the [[Intel 8008|8008]] and the [[Intel 8080|8080]] were never major revenue contributors at Intel. As the next processor, the [[Intel 8086|8086]] (and its variant the 8088) was completed in 1978, Intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed \"Operation Crush\", and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible. One design win was the newly created [[IBM PC]] division, though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time.\n\n[[IBM]] introduced its personal computer in 1981, and it was rapidly successful. In 1982, Intel created the [[Intel 80286|80286]] microprocessor, which, two years later, was used in the [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM PC/AT]]. [[Compaq]], the first IBM PC \"clone\" manufacturer, produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first [[Intel 80386|80386]]-based system, beating IBM and establishing a competitive market for PC-compatible systems and setting up Intel as a key [[component supplier]].\n\nIn 1975, the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32-bit microprocessor, finally released in 1981 as the [[Intel iAPX 432]]. The project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives, and it failed in the marketplace. Intel extended the [[x86|x86 architecture]] to 32 bits instead.<ref>{{cite web\n  |last=Maliniak\n  |first=Lisa\n  |title=Ten Notable Flops: Learning From Mistakes\n  |work=Electronic Design Online\n  |date=October 21, 2002\n  |url=http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&ArticleID=2839\n  |access-date=November 27, 2007\n  |url-status=dead\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216121817/http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&ArticleID=2839\n  |archive-date=December 16, 2008\n  |df=mdy-all\n  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  |last=Dvorak\n  |first=John C.\n  |author-link=John C.

Of perhaps greater importance was his decision to \"single-source\" the 386 microprocessor. Prior to this, microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy, and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production, interrupting supplies to customers. To mitigate this risk, these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply. The 8080 and 8086-series microprocessors were produced by several companies, notably AMD, with which Intel had a technology-sharing contract.\n\nGrove made the decision not to license the 386 design to other manufacturers, instead, producing it in three geographically distinct factories: [[Santa Clara, California]]; [[Hillsboro, Oregon]]; and [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]], a suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. He convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery. In doing this, Intel breached its contract with AMD, which sued and was paid millions of dollars in damages but could not manufacture new Intel CPU designs any longer. (Instead, AMD started to develop and manufacture its own competing x86 designs.)\n\nAs the success of [[Compaq]]'s [[Compaq Deskpro 386|Deskpro 386]] established the 386 as the dominant CPU choice, Intel achieved a position of near-exclusive dominance as its supplier. Profits from this funded rapid development of both higher-performance chip designs and higher-performance manufacturing capabilities, propelling Intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s.\n\n====486, Pentium, and Itanium====\nIntel introduced the [[Intel 80486|486]] microprocessor in 1989, and in 1990 established a second design team, designing the processors code-named \"[[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]]\" and \"[[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]]\" in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years, versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken. The P5 project was earlier known as \"Operation Bicycle\", referring to the cycles of the processor through two parallel execution pipelines. The P5 was introduced in 1993 as the Intel [[Pentium]], substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number. (Numbers, such as 486, cannot be legally registered as trademarks in the United States.) The P6 followed in 1995 as the [[Pentium Pro]] and improved into the [[Pentium II]] in 1997. New architectures were developed alternately in [[Santa Clara, California]] and [[Hillsboro, Oregon]].\n\nThe Santa Clara design team embarked in 1993 on a successor to the [[x86|x86 architecture]], codenamed \"P7\". The first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with [[Hewlett-Packard]] engineers, though Intel soon took over primary design responsibility. The resulting implementation of the [[Itanium|IA-64]] 64-bit architecture was the [[Itanium]], finally introduced in June 2001. The Itanium's performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations, and it failed to compete effectively with [[x86-64]], which was AMD's 64-bit extension of the 32-bit x86 architecture (Intel uses the name '''Intel 64''', previously '''EM64T'''). In 2017, Intel announced that the [[Kittson (processor)|Itanium 9700 series]] (Kittson) would be the last Itanium chips produced.<ref name=\"Davis 2017\">{{cite web\n  |url = https://itpeernetwork.intel.com/evolution-mission-critical-computing/\n  |title = The Evolution of Mission Critical Computing\n  |access-date = 2017-05-11\n  |df = mdy-all\n  |last = Davis\n  |first = Lisa M.\n  |date = 2017-05-11\n  |work = Intel\n  |quote = ...the 9700 series will be the last Intel Itanium processor.\n  |archive-date = May 17, 2017\n  |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170517090556/https://itpeernetwork.intel.com/evolution-mission-critical-computing/\n  |url-status = live\n  }}</ref><ref name=\"IA-PCWorld\">{{cite web|title=Intel's Itanium, once destined to replace x86 processors in PCs, hits end of line|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3196080/data-center/intels-itanium-once-destined-to-replace-x86-in-pcs-hits-end-of-line.html|website=PCWorld|access-date=May 15, 2017|language=en|date=May 11, 2017|archive-date=May 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515051735/http://www.pcworld.com/article/3196080/data-center/intels-itanium-once-destined-to-replace-x86-in-pcs-hits-end-of-line.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Hillsboro team designed the [[Pentium 4#Willamette|Willamette]] processors (initially code-named P68), which were marketed as the Pentium 4.\n\nDuring this period, Intel undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns.

IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from [[Microsoft]]. The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by then IAL Vice-president [[Steven McGeady]] at the [[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|Microsoft antitrust trial]] (''United States v. Microsoft Corp.'').\n\n====Pentium flaw====\n{{Main|Pentium FDIV bug}}\nIn June 1994, Intel engineers discovered a flaw in the [[floating-point]] math subsection of the [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium|Pentium microprocessor]]. Under certain data-dependent conditions, the low-order bits of the result of a floating-point division would be incorrect. The error could compound in subsequent calculations. Intel corrected the error in a future chip revision, and under public pressure it issued a total recall and replaced the defective Pentium CPUs (which were limited to some 60, 66, 75, 90, and 100&nbsp;MHz models<ref>[[Pentium FDIV bug#Affected models]]</ref>) on customer request.\n\nThe [[software bug|bug]] was discovered independently in October 1994 by Thomas Nicely, Professor of Mathematics at [[Lynchburg College]]. He contacted Intel but received no response. On October 30, he posted a message about his finding on the Internet.<ref name=\"Nicely-email\">{{cite web |url=http://www.emery.com/nicely.htm |title=Dr. Thomas Nicely's Pentium email |access-date=July 12, 2007 |last=Nicely |first=Dr. Thomas R. |date=October 30, 1994 |publisher=Vince Emery Productions |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116171317/http://www.emery.com/nicely.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref> Word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press. The bug was easy to replicate; a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system. Consequently, many users did not accept Intel's statements that the error was minor and \"not even an erratum\". During Thanksgiving, in 1994, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a piece by journalist [[John Markoff]] spotlighting the error. Intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip, quickly putting in place a large end-user [[Technical support|support]] organization. This resulted in a $475 million charge against Intel's 1994 [[revenue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trnicely.net/#PENT|title=Personal website of Dr. Nicely, who discovered the bug|last=Nicely|first=Thomas|access-date=April 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712050001/http://www.trnicely.net/#PENT|archive-date=July 12, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Dr. Nicely later learned that Intel had discovered the FDIV bug in its own testing a few months before him (but had decided not to inform customers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trnicely.net/pentbug/pentbug.html|title=\"Pentium FDIV flaw\" FAQ email from Dr. Nicely|last=Nicely|first=Thomas|access-date=May 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313230545/http://www.trnicely.net/pentbug/pentbug.html|archive-date=March 13, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Pentium flaw\" incident, Intel's response to it, and the surrounding media coverage propelled Intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name. Dovetailing with an uptick in the \"Intel Inside\" campaign, the episode is considered to have been a positive event for Intel, changing some of its business practices to be more end-user focused and generating substantial public awareness, while avoiding a lasting negative impression.<ref>Grove, Andrew and Burgleman, Robert; ''Strategy Is Destiny: How Strategy-Making Shapes a Company's Future'', 2001, Free Press<!--needs page number--></ref>\n\n=== Intel Core ===\n{{Main|Intel Core}}\nThe Intel Core line originated from the original Core brand, with the release of the [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] ''[[Yonah (microprocessor)|Yonah]]'' [[CPU]], Intel's first [[dual-core]] mobile (low-power) processor.

Mion, former Vice President of Marketing (2/88-7/89), MicroAge, cited February, 2016</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, Intel's market share was being seriously eroded by upstart competitors such as [[AMD]], [[Zilog]], and others who had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers. This was because, by using cheaper processors, manufacturers could make cheaper computers and gain more market share in an increasingly price-sensitive market. In 1989, Intel's Dennis Carter visited MicroAge's headquarters in Tempe, Arizona, to meet with MicroAge's VP of Marketing, Ron Mion. MicroAge had become one of the largest distributors of Compaq, IBM, HP, and others and thus was a primary{{snd}}although indirect{{snd}}driver of demand for microprocessors. Intel wanted MicroAge to petition its computer suppliers to favor Intel chips. However, Mion felt that the marketplace should decide which processors they wanted. Intel's counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate PC buyers on why Intel microprocessors were worth paying more for.<ref name=\"Mion\" />\n\nMion felt that the public did not really need to fully understand why Intel chips were better, they just needed to feel they were better. So Mion proposed a market test. Intel would pay for a MicroAge billboard somewhere saying, \"If you're buying a personal computer, make sure it has Intel inside.\" In turn, MicroAge would put \"Intel Inside\" stickers on the Intel-based computers in their stores in that area. To make the test easier to monitor, Mion decided to do the test in Boulder, Colorado, where it had a single store. Virtually overnight, the sales of personal computers in that store dramatically shifted to Intel-based PCs. Intel very quickly adopted \"Intel Inside\" as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide.<ref name=\"Mion\" /> As is often the case with computer lore, other tidbits have been combined to explain how things evolved. \"Intel Inside\" has not escaped that tendency and there are other \"explanations\" that had been floating around.\n\nIntel's branding campaign started with \"The Computer Inside\" tagline in 1990 in the U.S. and Europe. The Japan chapter of Intel proposed an \"Intel in it\" tagline and kicked off the Japanese campaign by hosting EKI-KON (meaning \"Station Concert\" in Japanese) at the Tokyo railway station dome on Christmas Day, December 25, 1990.

The Pentium name was first used to refer to the P5 core Intel processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers, so competitors could not just call their processor the same name, as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors (both of which had copies manufactured by IBM and AMD). They phased out the Pentium names from mobile processors first, when the new [[Yonah (microprocessor)|Yonah]] chips, branded [[Intel Core|Core]] Solo and Core Duo, were released. The desktop processors changed when the Core 2 line of processors were released. By 2009, Intel was using a [[good\u2013better\u2013best]] strategy with Celeron being good, Pentium better, and the Intel Core family representing the best the company has to offer.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/166973/intels_chip_renaming_strategy_meets_resistance.html |title=Intel's Chip Renaming Strategy Meets Resistance |last=Shah |first=Agam |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |access-date=June 22, 2009 |archive-date=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622062304/http://www.pcworld.com/article/166973/intels_chip_renaming_strategy_meets_resistance.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAccording to spokesman Bill Calder, Intel has maintained only the Celeron brand, the Atom brand for netbooks and the vPro lineup for businesses. Since late 2009, Intel's mainstream processors have been called Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9 in order of performance from lowest to highest. The 1st-generation Core products carry a 3 digit name, such as i5-750, and the 2nd-generation products carry a 4 digit name, such as the i5-2500, and from 10th-generation onwards, Intel processors will have a 5 digit name, such as i9-10900K for desktop. In all cases, a 'K' at the end of it shows that it is an unlocked processor, enabling additional overclocking abilities (for instance, 2500K). vPro products will carry the Intel Core i7 vPro processor or the Intel Core i5 vPro processor name.<ref name=\"Mag\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2348923,00.asp |title=Intel Simplifying its Processor Branding |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=June 17, 2009 |work=[[PC Magazine]] |access-date=July 6, 2009}}</ref> In October 2011, Intel started to sell its Core i7-2700K \"Sandy Bridge\" chip to customers worldwide.<ref>Anton Shilov, XBitLabs.

In 2016, Intel stated that it had expected its entire supply chain to be conflict-free by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gunther|first=Marc|date=2014-01-13|title=Intel unveils conflict-free processors: will the industry follow suit?|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/intel-conflict-minerals-ces-congo-electronics |df=mdy-all|access-date=2017-11-06|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=2016-01-05|title=In 2016, Intel's Entire Supply Chain Will Be Conflict-Free|language=en-US|work=Fast Company|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3055066/in-2016-intels-entire-supply-chain-will-be-conflict-free |df=mdy-all|access-date=2017-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=2014-01-06|title=Starting Now, All Intel Microprocessors Are Conflict-Free: Here's How The Company Did It|language=en-US|work=Fast Company|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3024292/starting-now-all-intel-microprocessors-are-conflict-free-heres-how-the-company-did-it |df=mdy-all|access-date=2017-11-06}}</ref>\n\nIn its 2012 rankings on the progress of consumer electronics companies relating to [[conflict minerals]], the Enough Project rated Intel the best of 24 companies, calling it a \"Pioneer of progress\".<ref name=\"EnoughProject2012\">{{cite web |url=http://www.enoughproject.org/files/CorporateRankings2012.pdf |title=Taking Conflict Out of Consumer Gadgets: Company Rankings on Conflict Minerals 2012 |access-date=August 17, 2012 |last=Lezhnev |first=Sasha |author2=Alex Hellmuth |date=August 2012 |publisher=[[Enough Project]]}}</ref> In 2014, chief executive Brian Krzanich urged the rest of the industry to follow Intel's lead by also shunning conflict minerals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25636001 |title=Intel vows to stop using 'conflict minerals' in new chips |last1=Miller |first1=Joe |date=January 7, 2014 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |publisher=The BBC |access-date=January 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Age discrimination complaints===\nIntel has faced complaints of [[age discrimination]] in firing and layoffs.

FACE Intel claims that more than 90% of people who have been laid off or fired from Intel are over the age of 40.

Intel had reportedly been paying taxes as a non-air-conditioned office, when the campus in fact had central air conditioning. Other factors, such as land acquisition and construction improvements, added to the tax burden. Previously, Intel had appealed the demand in the [[Karnataka]] high court in July, during which the court ordered Intel to pay BBMP half the owed amount of {{INRConvert|170|m}} plus arrears by August 28 of that year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kasli|first=Shelley|date=August 10, 2016|title=Rothschild Inside, Garbage Outside|url=http://greatgameindia.com/rothschild-inside-garbage-outside/|journal=GreatGameIndia Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Kay|date=August 10, 2016|title=Indian city raises stink over Intel's unpaid taxes|url=http://www.dontmesswithtaxes.com/2016/08/indian-city-raises-stink-over-unpaid-tax-by-intel.html|website=Don't Mess With Taxes|access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Product issues ==\n<!-- \nAdd Product issues section like Tesla's article\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.#Vehicle_product_issues\n-->\n=== Recalls ===\n==== Pentium FDIV bug ====\n{{Excerpt|Pentium FDIV bug|paragraphs=1|references=no}}\n\n=== Security vulnerabilities ===\n==== Transient execution CPU vulnerability ====\n{{Excerpt|Transient execution CPU vulnerability}}\n\n=== Instability issues ===\n==== Raptor Lake ====\n{{Excerpt|Raptor Lake|Instability and degradation issue|paragraphs=1|references=no}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[5 nm process]]\n* [[ASCI Red]]\n* [[Bumpless Build-up Layer]]\n* [[Comparison of ATI graphics processing units]]\n* [[Comparison of Intel processors]]\n* [[Comparison of Nvidia graphics processing units]]\n* [[Cyrix]]\n* [[Engineering sample]] (CPU)\n* [[Graphics processing unit]] (GPU)\n* [[Intel Developer Zone]] (Intel DZ)\n* [[Intel Driver Update Utility]]\n* [[Intel GMA]] (Graphics Media Accelerator)\n* [[Intel HD and Iris Graphics]]\n* [[Intel Level Up]]\n* [[Intel Loihi]]\n* [[Intel Museum]]\n* [[Intel Science Talent Search]]\n* [[List of Intel chipsets]]\n* [[List of Intel CPU microarchitectures]]\n* [[List of Intel manufacturing sites]]\n* [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Intel]]\n* [[List of semiconductor fabrication plants]]\n* [[Intel Management Engine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Intel-related biographical articles on Wikipedia'''\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Andy Grove]]\n* [[Bill Gaede]]\n* [[Bob Colwell]]\n* [[Craig Barrett (chief executive)]]\n* [[Gordon Moore]]\n* [[Justin Rattner]]\n* [[Pat Gelsinger]]\n* [[Paul Otellini]]\n* [[Robert Noyce]]\n* [[Sean Maloney (technology)|Sean Maloney]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Intel}}\n* {{Official website}}\n{{Finance links\n| name = Intel Corporation\n| symbol = INTC\n| sec_cik = 50863\n| yahoo = INTC\n| google = INTC:NASDAQ\n}}\n\n{{Intel}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Intel-related navigation boxes\n| list =  \n{{Intel technology}}\n{{Intel software}}\n{{Intel processors}}\n{{Solid-state drive}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Open Handset Alliance Members}}\n{{Major semiconductor companies}}\n{{Programmable Logic}}\n{{Electronics industry in the United States}} \n}}\n{{Authority control}}<!-- IMPORTANT!
