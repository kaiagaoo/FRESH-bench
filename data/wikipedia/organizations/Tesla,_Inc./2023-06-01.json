In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"<ref name=\"10K_2021\" /> This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers.<ref name=\"bypass\" /> The United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.<ref name=\"Lao-Feinstein-2015\">{{cite web|date=May 11, 2015|title=Direct-to-consumer auto sales: It's not just about Tesla|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/competition-matters/2015/05/direct-consumer-auto-sales-its-not-just-about-tesla}}</ref><ref name=\"Read-2015\">{{cite web|last=Read|first=Richard|date=May 13, 2015|title=Can The FTC Persuade Michigan & Other States To Open Their Doors To Tesla?|url=https://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1098273_can-the-ftc-persuade-michigan-other-states-to-open-their-doors-to-tesla|work=The Car Connection|access-date=August 21, 2021|archive-date=July 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210727220517/https://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1098273_can-the-ftc-persuade-michigan-other-states-to-open-their-doors-to-tesla|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Bodisch-2009\">{{cite web|last=Bodisch|first=Gerald R.|date=May 2009|title=Economic Effects Of State Bans On Direct Manufacturer Sales To Car Buyers|url=https://www.justice.gov/atr/public/eag/246374.htm|access-date=July 9, 2019|publisher=Department of Justice|location=US}}</ref>\n\nTesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.<ref name=\"TechCrunch-2021\">{{cite web|title=EV rivals Tesla, Rivian unite to target direct sales legislation|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/ev-rivals-tesla-rivian-unite-to-target-direct-sales-legislation/|access-date=August 9, 2021|website=TechCrunch|date=March 3, 2021 |language=en-US}}</ref> The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,<ref name=\"10K_2021\" /> because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles.
