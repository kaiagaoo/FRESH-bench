When it built the [[Tesla Roadster (first generation)|first generation Roadster]], it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18&nbsp;mm diameter, 65&nbsp;mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an [[intumescent]] fire prevention chemical.<ref name=\"gcr2013-06\">{{cite news |last=Fisher |first=Thomas |date=June 11, 2013 |title=What Goes into A Tesla Model S Battery \u2013 And What It May Cost |website=Green Car Reports |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1084682_what-goes-into-a-tesla-model-s-battery--and-what-it-may-cost |url-status=dead |access-date=February 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503210702/https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1084682_what-goes-into-a-tesla-model-s-battery--and-what-it-may-cost |archive-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref> However, the decision turned out to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality.

Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster.\n\nSince the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017, Tesla has also been building IPM-SynRM motors. These motors use an iron [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]], with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent starting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to [[counter-electromotive force]]s. For high-speed operation, Tesla engineers used iron's reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the [[stator]] if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Tesla Model 3's IPM-SynRM electric motor explained |url=https://uk.motor1.com/news/462107/video-tesla-model-3-electric-motor-explained/ |access-date=2024-07-09 |work=Motor1 |language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Gaddam |first=Yogeshwari S. |date=January 8, 2021 |title=Tesla Model 3's IPM-SynRM electric motor |url=https://www.lesics.com/tesla-model-3_s-ipm-synrm-electric-motor.html |access-date=2024-07-09 |website=Lesics}}</ref> The IPM-SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/motor-technology-from-model-3-helps-tesla-boost-model-s-range-10/ |title=Motor technology from Model 3 helps Tesla boost Model S range 10% |website=[[ArsTechnica]] |date=April 24, 2019 |access-date=November 3, 2019 |archive-date=January 21, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121072656/https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/motor-technology-from-model-3-helps-tesla-boost-model-s-range-10/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|NACS}} North American Charging Standard ===\n{{main|North American Charging Standard}}\n\nThe [[North American Charging Standard]] (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla.
