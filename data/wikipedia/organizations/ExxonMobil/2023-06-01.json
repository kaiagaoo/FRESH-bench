Jersey Standard grew alongside and with extensive partnership another Standard Oil descendant and its future merger partner, the [[Mobil|Standard Oil Company of New York]] (Socony), both of which grew bigger by merging with various third companies like [[Humble Oil]] (which merged with Jersey Standard) and Vacuum Oil (merged with Socony). Both companies underwent rebranding in the 1960s and early 1970s, and by the time of the 1999 merger, Jersey Standard had been known as Exxon, and Socony known as Mobil. The merger agreement between Exxon and Mobil stipulated that Exxon would buy Mobil and rebrand as ExxonMobil, with Mobil's CEO becoming the vice-chairman of the company.<ref name=\"Kumar 2019 101\u2013109\">{{Citation |last=Kumar |first=B.

United States|its breakup]], and merged by the Standard Oil Company of New York, later known as [[Mobil]], in the 1930s. After the 1911 breakup, Standard Oil continued to exist through its New Jersey subsidiary, sometimes shortened to Jersey Standard, and retained the Standard Oil name in much of the eastern United States. Jersey Standard grew by acquiring [[Humble Oil]] in the 1930s and became the dominant oil company on the world stage. The company's lack of ownership over the Standard Oil name across the United States, however, prompted a name change to unify all of its brands under one name, choosing to name itself Exxon in 1972 over continuing to use three distinct brands of [[Esso]], [[Enco (brand)|Enco]], and Humble.<ref>{{Cite web |last=for the City of Rochester |date=September 1990 |title=Detailed Historical Site Assessment of the Vacuum Oil Company's facilities and locations |url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/data/DecDocs/C828218/Application.BCP.C828218.1990-09-01.Detailed%20Historical%20Site%20Assessmwnt%20Vacuum%20Oil%20Site.pdf |access-date=May 8, 2023 |website=New York Department of Environmental Conservation}}</ref><ref name=\"Kumar 2019 101\u2013109\" />\n\nIn 1998, the two companies agreed to merge and form ExxonMobil, with the deal closing on November 30, 1999.
