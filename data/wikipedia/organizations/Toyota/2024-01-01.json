It was founded by [[Kiichiro Toyoda]] and incorporated on August 28, 1937. Toyota is the [[List of manufacturers by motor vehicle production|largest automobile manufacturer]] in the world, producing about 10 million vehicles per year.\n\nThe company was originally founded as a spinoff of [[Toyota Industries]], a machine maker started by [[Sakichi Toyoda]], Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the [[Toyota Group]], one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the [[Toyota Type A engine|Type A engine]], in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the [[Toyota AA]].\n\nAfter World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to [[The Toyota Way]] (a management philosophy) and the [[Toyota Production System]] (a [[lean manufacturing]] practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.\n\nIn the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of the [[Japanese economic miracle|rapidly growing Japanese economy]] to sell cars to a growing middle-class, leading to the development of the [[Toyota Corolla]], which became the world's [[List of best-selling automobiles|all-time best-selling automobile]]. The booming economy also funded an international expansion that allowed Toyota to grow into one of the largest automakers in the world, the [[List of largest Japanese companies|largest company in Japan]] and the [[List of largest companies by revenue|ninth-largest company in the world by revenue]], {{as of|lc=y|2020|12}}. Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle. By September 2023, total production reached 300 million vehicles.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/39996185.html |title=Toyota Reaches Global Production of 300 Million Cars |publisher=Toyota |date=2023-11-06 |access-date=2023-11-11}}</ref>\n\nToyota was praised for being a leader in the development and sales of more fuel-efficient [[Toyota hybrid vehicles|hybrid electric vehicles]], starting with the introduction of the [[Toyota Prius (XW10)|XW10 Toyota Prius]] in 1997. The company now sells more than 40 hybrid vehicle models around the world. More recently, the company has also been criticized for being slow to adopt [[Electric vehicle|all-electric vehicles]] and focusing on the development of [[Fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell vehicles]], like the [[Toyota Mirai]], a technology that is costlier and has fallen far behind electric batteries.\n\n{{As of|2022}}, the Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under four brands: [[Daihatsu]], [[Hino Motors|Hino]], [[Lexus]] <!-- Do not add defunct Scion -->and the namesake Toyota. The company also holds a 20% stake in [[Subaru Corporation]], a 5.1% stake in [[Mazda]], a 4.9% stake in [[Suzuki]], a 4.6% stake in [[Isuzu]], a 3.8% stake in [[Yamaha Motor Corporation]], and a 2.8% stake in [[Panasonic]], as well as stakes in vehicle manufacturing joint-ventures in China ([[FAW Toyota]] and [[GAC Toyota]]), the Czech Republic ([[Toyota Peugeot Citro\u00ebn Automobile Czech|TPCA]]), India ([[Toyota Kirloskar Motor|Toyota Kirloskar]]) and the United States ([[Mazda Toyota Manufacturing USA|MTMUS]]).\n\nToyota is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]], [[Nagoya Stock Exchange]], [[New York Stock Exchange]] and on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]], where its stock is a component of the [[Nikkei 225]] and [[TOPIX]] Core30 indices.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Toyota}}\n\n===1920s{{ndash}}1930s===\n{{primary|section|date=December 2023}}\n[[File:Toyota Loom Mass Production Bertel Schmitt.jpg|thumb|The mass-produced Toyoda automated loom, displayed at Toyota Museum in Aichi-gun, Japan]]\n\nIn 1924, [[Sakichi Toyoda]] invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic [[Loom]].

However, [[Rizaburo Toyoda]], who had [[mukoy\u014dshi|married into the family]] and was not born with that name, preferred \"Toyota\" ({{nihongo2|\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf}}) because it took eight brush strokes (a lucky number) to write in Japanese, was visually simpler (leaving off the [[Dakuten|diacritic]] at the end), and with a [[voiceless|voiceless consonant]] instead of a [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] one (voiced consonants are considered to have a \"murky\" or \"muddy\" sound compared to voiceless consonants, which are \"clear\").\n\nSince ''toyoda'' literally means \"fertile rice paddies\", changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old-fashioned farming.

Before the crisis, large and heavy vehicles with powerful but inefficient engines were common. But in the years after, consumers started demanding high-quality and fuel-efficient small cars.

This, along with growing [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States|anti-Japanese sentiment]], prompted the U.S. Congress to consider import restrictions to protect the domestic auto industry.\n\nThe 1960s also saw the slight opening of the Japanese auto market to foreign companies. In an effort to strengthen Japan's auto industry ahead of the market opening, Toyota purchased stakes in other Japanese automakers. That included a stake in [[Hino Motors]], a manufacturer of large commercial trucks, buses and diesel engines, along with a 16.8 percent stake in [[Daihatsu]], a manufacturer of [[kei car]]s, the smallest highway-legal passenger vehicles sold in Japan.<ref name=\"NYT1995\">{{Cite news |last=Pollack |first=Andrew |date=September 21, 1995 |title=Toyota Doubles Its Holdings in Daihatsu Motor of Japan |work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/21/business/international-business-toyota-doubles-its-holdings-in-daihatsu-motor-of-japan.html |access-date=December 27, 2016}}</ref> That began what became a long-standing partnership between Toyota and the two companies.

The 14 principles are further defined [[The Toyota Way|in the Wikipedia article]] on The Toyota Way.\n\n===Toyota Production System===\n{{Main|Toyota Production System}}\n\nThe Toyota Way also helped shape the company's approach to production, where it was an early pioneer of what would become known as [[lean manufacturing]].<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Spear |first=Steven |title=The Toyota Production System: An Example of Managing Complex Social/Technical Systems |date=January 1999 |publisher=Harvard University |url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/shared/ods/documents/Spear_1999_DBA_Dissertation.pdf&PubID=18108 |location=US |url-status=live |access-date=March 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190927051517/http://mitsloan.mit.edu/shared/ods/documents/Spear_1999_DBA_Dissertation.pdf%26PubID%3D18108 |archive-date=September 27, 2019}}</ref> The company defines the Toyota Production System under two main pillars: [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in-time]]<ref>ibidem,  p. 11 ff.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=December 2023}} (make only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed) and [[Jidoka]]<ref>ibidem,  p. 25 ff.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=December 2023}} (automation with a human touch).\n\nThe origin of the Toyota Production System is in dispute, with three stories of its origin: (1) that during a 1950 trip to train with the [[Ford Motor Company]], company executives also studied the [[Just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] distribution system of the grocery store company [[Piggly-Wiggly]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=oXkyafb6OQMC&dq=%22piggly+wiggly%22+toyota&pg=PT40 How Toyota Became #1: Leadership Lessons from the World's Greatest Car Company] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190037/https://books.google.com/books?id=oXkyafb6OQMC&pg=PT40&lpg=PT40&dq=%22piggly+wiggly%22+toyota&source=bl&ots=SXj2A9TTFm&sig=PR0Q5jmwUMtKk10p5QTzXu6EgxM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UMZMUNrcG8jI0AGoooDYBw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22piggly%20wiggly%22%20toyota&f=false|date=January 1, 2016}} By David Magee.

Other companies were interested in the instruction, and Toyota later started offering training sessions. The company also has donated the training to non-profit groups to increase their efficiency and thus ability to serve people.\n\n===Logo and branding===\n[[File:Toyota Sign Development Bertel Schmitt.jpg|thumb|Employee at the [[Toyota Automobile Museum]] explains development of Toyota name and brand.]]\n\nIn 1936, Toyota entered the passenger car market with its Model AA and held a competition to establish a new logo emphasizing speed for its new product line. After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\", which means rice paddy. The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo was a heavily stylized version of the [[katakana]] characters for Toyota ({{nihongo2|\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf}}).<ref name=\"Toyota Logo History\">{{Cite web|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|last3=|date=April 30, 2020|title=Toyota Logo History|url=https://www.carlogos.org/car-brands/toyota-logo.html|access-date=August 6, 2021|website=Carlogos.org|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAs the company started to expand internationally in the late 1950s, the katakana character logo was supplemented by various wordmarks with the English form of the company name in all capital letters, \"TOYOTA.\"<ref name=\"Toyota Logo History\" />\n\nToyota introduced a worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand.<ref>New brand for Toyota ''[[Australasian Transport News|Queensland Transport News]]'' October 26, 1989, page 11</ref> The logo consists of three ovals that combine to form the letter \"T\", which stands for Toyota. Toyota says that the overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the \"global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future\".<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Company > Vision & Philosophy > Nov/Dec 2004 |url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022095517/http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |archive-date=October 22, 2009 |access-date=October 31, 2009 |publisher=Toyota |location=Japan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite press release |title=Passion |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024915/http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |access-date=August 8, 2011 |publisher=Toyota}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=December 2023}} The new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most vehicles in 1990.\n\nIn countries or regions using [[traditional Chinese character]]s, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as \"\u8c50\u7530\".<ref name=\"Crown Motors\">{{Cite web |year=2010 |title=Crown Motors Ltd.
