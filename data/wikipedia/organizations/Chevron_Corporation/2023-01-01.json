The company grew quickly after the [[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States|breakup of Standard Oil]] by acquiring companies and partnering with others, especially [[Texaco]]. Socal was one of the Seven Sisters that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.

Since oil refineries are incredibly complicated process plants, Chevron wanted Maxis to make them a game like SimCity, as a training tool to teach employees at their oil refinery in Richmond, California how the refinery worked.
