trademarks, such as blocking trademark registration that involve \"rockstar\", \"bully\", \"2K\", and the capital letter \"R\". The publisher filed a dispute against [[Hazelight Studios]] to block its attempt to trademark ''[[It Takes Two (video game)|It Takes Two]]'', due to the similarity of its name to Take-Two's. Hazelight was forced to abandon the trademark application, making it more difficult to promote the game.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coulson|first1=Josh|title=Take-Two Targets It Takes Two In Latest Wave Of Trademark Disputes|url=https://www.thegamer.com/take-two-it-takes-two-trademark-dispute|website=TheGamer|access-date=December 1, 2021|date=December 1, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=List of trademark disputes relating to Take-Two Interactive|url=https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Take-Two%20Interactive%20Software,%20Inc.|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Tom|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-12-03-josef-fares-it-takes-two-hit-by-take-two-trademark-claim|title=Josef Fares' It Takes Two hit by Take-Two claim|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=December 3, 2021|access-date=December 3, 2021}}</ref>\n\nTake-Two has also been active in blocking the release of [[Grand Theft Auto modding|mods for ''Grand Theft Auto'' games]]. While some of these mods had used assets from the original games and gave valid reason for Take-Two to protect its copyrights, other mods that Take-Two had targeted were made from legal [[reverse engineering]] of the game, making Take-Two's claims contentious. Take-Two has clarified that it had no issue with mods intended for single-player games that were legally made, but would take action against other types of mods.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/rockstar-is-talking-with-openiv-developer-issues-new-statement-on-mods/ | title = Rockstar is talking with OpenIV developer, issues new statement on mods | first = Christopher | last = Livingstone | newspaper = PC Gamer | date = 23 June 2017 | accessdate = 19 July 2021 | archive-date = 18 July 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210718215105/https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/rockstar-is-talking-with-openiv-developer-issues-new-statement-on-mods/ | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n== Games published ==\n{{Main|List of Take-Two Interactive games}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://www.take2games.com/}}\n\n{{Finance links\n| name = Take-Two Interactive\n| symbol = TTWO\n| sec_cik = TTWO\n| yahoo = TTWO\n| google = TTWO\n| stockrow = TTWO\n}}\n\n{{Take-Two Interactive}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Take-Two Interactive| ]]\n[[Category:1993 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1997 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1993]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the Nasdaq]]\n[[Category:Holding companies based in New York City]]\n[[Category:Holding companies established in 1993]]\n[[Category:Holding companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Publicly traded companies based in New York City]]\n[[Category:Video game companies established in 1993]]\n[[Category:Video game companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Video game development companies]]\n[[Category:Video game publishers]]"}
