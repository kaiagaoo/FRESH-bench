Hosts and guests are unable to see reviews until both have submitted a review or until the time period to review has closed, a system that aims to improve accuracy and objectivity by removing fears that users will receive a negative review in retaliation if they write one. However, the truthfulness and impartiality of reviews may be adversely affected by concerns of future stays because prospective hosts may refuse to host a user who generally leaves negative reviews. The company's policy requires users to forego anonymity, which may also detract from users' willingness to leave negative reviews. These factors may damage the objectivity of the review system.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.inc.com/sonya-mann/airbnb-nightmare-experiences.html | title=Why Airbnb Reviews Don't Tell the Whole Story | first=Sonya | last=Mann | work=Inc. | date=May 3, 2017 | access-date=March 3, 2018 | archive-date=October 16, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201016033436/https://www.inc.com/sonya-mann/airbnb-nightmare-experiences.html | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/why-airbnb-reviews-are-a-problem-for-the-site-2015-6 | title=Why Airbnb reviews are a problem for the site | first=Molly | last=Mulshine | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=June 18, 2015 | access-date=April 20, 2019 | archive-date=June 5, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605181837/https://www.businessinsider.com/why-airbnb-reviews-are-a-problem-for-the-site-2015-6 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://mashable.com/2015/05/18/airbnb-reviews/ | title=Why you should think twice before trusting Airbnb reviews | first=Erica | last=Ho | work=[[Mashable]] | date=May 19, 2015 | access-date=March 3, 2018 | archive-date=March 4, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304172327/https://mashable.com/2015/05/18/airbnb-reviews/ | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Response to activities of far-right extremists===\nIn August 2017, Airbnb cancelled numerous bookings and closed accounts belonging to attendees of the [[white nationalist]] [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], citing its [[terms of service]] in which members must \"accept people regardless of their race, [[religion]], national origin, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[disability]], sex, [[gender identity]], sexual orientation, or age.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Bromwich | first=Jonah Engel | title=Airbnb Cancels Accounts Linked to White Nationalist Rally in Charlottesville | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/us/airbnb-white-nationalists-supremacists.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 9, 2017 | url-access=limited | access-date=September 20, 2018 | archive-date=August 10, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810212541/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/us/airbnb-white-nationalists-supremacists.html | url-status=live }}</ref> The move was criticized by [[Jason Kessler]], organizer of the rally.<ref>{{cite news | first1=Madison | last1=Park | first2=Chris | last2=Boyette | title=Airbnb removes users affiliated with white nationalists' rally | url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/09/us/airbnb-cancels-bookings-white-nationalists-rally/index.html | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=August 9, 2017 | access-date=March 24, 2019 | archive-date=March 24, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324031704/https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/09/us/airbnb-cancels-bookings-white-nationalists-rally/index.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2021, Airbnb was criticized for allowing participants in the [[January 6 United States Capitol attack|January 6 attack on the United States Capitol]] to book units on the platform in the [[Washington metropolitan area]], despite most hotels in the vicinity of [[Capitol Hill]] banning [[far-right extremist]]s.<ref>{{cite news | first=Ruth | last=Tam | title=Trump Insurrectionists Lodge At D.C.
