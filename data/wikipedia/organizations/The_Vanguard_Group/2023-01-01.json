Asset growth in the first years was slow, partially because the fund did not pay commissions to brokers who sold it, which was unusual at the time. Within a year, the fund had only grown to $17 million in assets, but one of the Wellington Funds that Vanguard was administering had to be merged in with another fund, and Bogle convinced Wellington to merge it in with the Index fund.<ref name=\"firstindex\" /><ref name=\"tooworried\" /> This brought assets up to almost $100 million.\n\nGrowth in assets accelerated after the beginning of a [[bull market]] in 1982, and the indexing model became more popular at other companies.
