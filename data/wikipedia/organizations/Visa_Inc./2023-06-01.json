BofA itself (like all other U.S. banks at the time) could not expand directly into other states due to federal restrictions [[Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994|not repealed until 1994]].

The logo still appears on many French-issued Visa cards today.\n* In Japan, [[The Sumitomo Bank]] issued BankAmericards through the Sumitomo Credit Service.\n* In the UK, the only BankAmericard issuer for some years was [[Barclaycard]].

Although Bank of America had cultivated the public image that BankAmericard's troubled startup issues were now safely in the past, Hock realized that the BankAmericard licensee program itself was in terrible disarray because it had developed and grown very rapidly in an ''ad hoc'' fashion. For example, \"interchange\" transaction issues ''between'' banks were becoming a very serious problem, which had not been seen before when Bank of America was the sole issuer of BankAmericards.  Hock suggested to other licensees that they form a committee to investigate and analyze the various problems with the licensee program; they promptly made him the chair of that committee.<ref>Nocera, 89-92.</ref>\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations, the committee led by Hock was able to persuade Bank of America that a bright future lay ahead for BankAmericard \u2014 outside Bank of America. In June 1970, Bank of America gave up control of the BankAmericard program. The various BankAmericard issuer banks took control of the program, creating National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI), an independent [[Delaware General Corporation Law|Delaware corporation]] which would be in charge of managing, promoting and developing the BankAmericard system within the United States. In other words, BankAmericard was transformed from a franchising system into a jointly controlled consortium or alliance, like its competitor Master Charge. Hock became NBI's first president and CEO.<ref>Nocera, 90-93.</ref>\n\nHowever, Bank of America retained the right to directly license BankAmericard to banks outside the United States and continued to issue and support such licenses. By 1972, licenses had been granted in 15 countries. The international licensees soon encountered a variety of problems with their licensing programs, and they hired Hock as a consultant to help them restructure their relationship with BofA as he had done for the domestic licensees. As a result, in 1974, the International Bankcard Company (IBANCO), a multinational member corporation, was founded in order to manage the international BankAmericard program.<ref>{{citation |last1=Batiz-Lazo |first1=Bernardo |last2=del Angel |first2=Gustavo |title=The Dawn of the Plastic Jungle: The Introduction of the Credit Card in Europe and North America, 1950-1975 |journal=Economics Working Papers |publisher=Hoover Institution |date=2016 |page=18 |url= https://ideas.repec.org/p/hoo/wpaper/16107.html}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Barclaycard.png\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 =\n| image2 = Chargex.svg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 =\n| footer = Sample [[Barclaycard]] (left), as issued in the UK in the 1960s/70s.
