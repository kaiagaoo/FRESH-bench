('''WBD''') is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[mass media]] and [[Show business|entertainment]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] headquartered at 230 [[Park Avenue South]] in [[New York City]]. It was formed after the [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[WarnerMedia]] by [[AT&T]], and its merger with [[Discovery, Inc.]] on April 8, 2022.\n\nThe company's properties are divided into nine business units, including the flagship [[Warner Bros.]] [[Warner Bros. Pictures|film]] and [[Warner Bros. Television|television]] studios, [[comic book]] publisher [[DC Entertainment]], [[Home Box Office, Inc.]] (which includes [[HBO]]), U.S. Networks (which includes the majority of the ad-supported cable networks of its predecessors, including Discovery, [[Scripps Networks Interactive|Scripps Networks]], [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting]], and Warner), [[CNN]], [[Warner Bros. Discovery Sports|Sports]] (which includes [[Motor Trend Group]], [[AT&T SportsNet]], TNT Sports, and [[Eurosport]], among others), Global Streaming & Interactive Entertainment (which includes the [[Discovery+]] and [[HBO Max]] streaming services, and video game publisher [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]]), and International Networks. It also holds a minority stake in [[The CW]] and a majority stake in the [[Food Network]] (including its spin-off network [[Cooking Channel]]), all of which are alongside [[Nexstar Media Group]], and the former alongside [[Paramount Global]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Warner Bros.|Kinney National Company|WarnerMedia|Turner Broadcasting System|Discovery, Inc.|Discovery Channel|Scripps Networks Interactive}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2022}}\n[[Warner Bros.]], [[Turner Broadcasting System]], [[Scripps Networks Interactive]] and [[Discovery, Inc.]] have conjoined histories over the years. Warner Bros. was founded in 1923 by four brothers, [[Harry Warner|Harry]], [[Albert Warner|Albert]], [[Sam Warner|Sam]], and [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]], the company established itself as a leader in the American [[Warner Bros. Pictures|film]] industry before diversifying into [[Warner Bros. Animation|animation]], [[Warner Bros. Television Studios|television]], and [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment|video games]] and is one of the [[Major film studio|\"Big Five\"]] major American [[film studio]]s, as well as a member of the [[Motion Picture Association]] (MPA). In 1965, [[Turner Broadcasting System]] was founded by [[Ted Turner]] and based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. A year later, [[Kinney National Company]] came into existence and its media division became [[WarnerMedia|Warner Communications]] before merging with [[Time Inc.]] in 1990 to become Time Warner. During its time as Warner Communications, the company made a number of further acquisitions.\n\nIn 1979, Warner formed a joint venture with credit card company [[American Express]] called [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]]. This company owned such cable channels as [[MTV]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[The Movie Channel]], and [[VH1]] (which was launched in 1985 on the channel space left by Turner's [[Cable Music Channel]]). Warner bought out American Express's half in 1984 and sold the venture a year later to the [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|original iteration of Viacom]], which renamed it [[Paramount Media Networks#Background|MTV Networks]] (now known as Paramount Media Networks). In 1982, Warner purchased [[Popular Library]] from [[CBS Publications]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[Discovery, Inc.|Cable Education Network]] was founded in 1985 and was renamed to Discovery Communications in 1994. [[Scripps Networks Interactive]] was founded in 2008 spun off from [[E. W. Scripps Company]]'s cable division.\n\nOn October 10, 1996, Time Warner acquired the Turner Broadcasting System; but the company later merged with [[AOL]] to form AOL Time Warner in 2001 and reverted back to Time Warner name in 2003. Time Warner spun off [[Time Warner Cable|its cable division]] (later known as [[Spectrum (brand)|Spectrum]] owned by [[Charter Communications]]) and AOL (now owned by [[Yahoo! Inc. (2017\u2013present)|Yahoo! Inc.]]) in 2009 and Time, Inc. was spun out in 2013, which was later acquired by [[Meredith Corporation]] in January 2018 and is now known as [[Dotdash Meredith]]. Discovery Communications acquired Scripps Networks Interactive in March 2018 and was renamed to Discovery, Inc. while [[AT&T]] acquired Time Warner that June. In March 2019, AT&T dissolved the Turner Broadcasting System as part of its reorganization of its media assets.\n\n==History==\n===Formation (2021\u20132022)===\n[[File:Warner Bros.
