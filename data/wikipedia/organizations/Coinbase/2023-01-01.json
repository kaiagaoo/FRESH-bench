The problem was initiated when banks and card issuers changed the [[merchant category code]] (MCC) for cryptocurrency purchases earlier that month. This meant that cryptocurrency payments would now be processed as \"cash advances\", meaning that banks and credit card issuers could begin charging customers cash advance fees for cryptocurrency purchases. Customers who purchased cryptocurrency on their exchange between January 22 and February 11, 2018, could have been affected. At first, Visa blamed Coinbase, telling the ''Financial Times'' on February 16 that it had \"not made any systems changes that would result in the duplicate transactions cardholders are reporting.\" However, the latest statement from Visa and Worldpay on the Coinbase blog clarifies: \"This issue was not caused by Coinbase.\"<ref>{{Cite news |date=February 5, 2018 |title=Update: VISA issuers and Mastercard make it harder to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies |language=en-US |work=TechCrunch |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/visa-and-mastercard-make-it-harder-to-buy-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies/&sa=D&ust=1543486813893000&usg=AFQjCNFhjBv-HE6ePJ0gHIKpyECT6ibOfQ |access-date=November 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2018, ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'' reported that the number of monthly customer complaints against Coinbase jumped more than 100% in January of that year, to 889, citing official [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] data, with more than 400 of those categorized as \"money was not available when promised\".<ref name=quartz1>{{Cite news |last=Detrixhe, John |date=March 5, 2018 |title=Coinbase's customer complaints more than doubled in January |work=Quartz |url=https://qz.com/1220367/coinbases-customer-complaints-more-than-doubled-in-january/ |access-date=March 6, 2018 |archive-date=March 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305223248/https://qz.com/1220367/coinbases-customer-complaints-more-than-doubled-in-january/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The article also noted that the company was subsequently increasing its customer service staff to reduce wait times.<ref name=quartz1/>\n\nIn December 2021, [[CNBC]] reported that Coinbase froze the cryptocurrency GYEN due to a sudden price spike, resulting in many traders losing money.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Javers|first=Scott Zamost, Eamon|date=2021-12-08|title=Coinbase customers demand refunds over GYEN stablecoin glitch|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/08/coinbase-customers-demand-refunds-over-gyen-stablecoin-glitch.html|access-date=2021-12-08|website=CNBC|language=en|archive-date=December 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211208190555/https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/08/coinbase-customers-demand-refunds-over-gyen-stablecoin-glitch.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Insider trading ==\n{{Main|SEC v.
