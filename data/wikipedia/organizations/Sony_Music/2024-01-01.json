Sony Music Entertainment (UK) Ltd.}}\nBritish artist [[George Michael]], signed to Columbia in the U.S. and Epic worldwide, advised Sony executives in 1990 that he would not be appearing in music videos to support his forthcoming album, ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]''. Michael then accused Sony of not promoting the album at all. He sued in the UK in 1992, asking to be released from his contract. Sony ultimately prevailed in the courts in 1994, but Michael's contract was bought out by other labels. Some 11 years later, Michael licensed tracks to Sony for release.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Coulthard |first=Alan |date=September 1995 |title=George Michael v Sony Music-A Challenge to Artistic Freedom? |journal=The Modern Law Review |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=731\u2013744 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.1995.tb02047.x |issn=0026-7961|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n=== Michael Jackson and Tommy Mottola ===\nThe release of ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'' was preceded by a dispute between [[Michael Jackson]] and Sony Music Entertainment.
