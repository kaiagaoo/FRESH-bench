The complaints filed by the FTC included that Qualcomm charged \"disproportionately high\" patent royalty rates to phone manufacturers and refused to sell them broadband chips if they did not license the patents, a policy referred to as \"no license, no chips\", that Qualcomm refused to license the patent to other chip manufacturers as to maintain their monopoly, and that Qualcomm purposely offered Apple a lower license cost to use their chips exclusively, locking other competitors as well as wireless service providers out of Apple's lucrative market.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Robertson |first=Adi |date=January 9, 2019 |title=Competitors say Qualcomm is running a monopoly \u2014 here's why |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18173756/qualcomm-ftc-antitrust-monopoly-trial-explainer |access-date=August 11, 2020 |website=[[The Verge]] |archive-date=August 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808191711/https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18173756/qualcomm-ftc-antitrust-monopoly-trial-explainer |url-status=live }}</ref> The trial starting in January 2019, heard by Judge [[Lucy Koh]] of the federal [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District Court]] that also oversaw the Apple case. Judge Koh ruled in May 2019 against Qualcomm, asserting that Qualcomm's practices did violate antitrust. As part of the ruling, Qualcomm was forced to stop its \"no license, no chips\" bundling with phone manufacturers, and was required to license its patents to other chip manufacturers. As Qualcomm had expressed its intent to appeal, a panel of judges on the 9th circuit of appeals stayed the orders pending the litigation action.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Porter |first=Jon |date=May 22, 2019 |title=Qualcomm's licensing terms are anti-competitive, US judge rules |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18635379/ftc-qualcomm-victory-lawsuit-court-anti-competitive-practices-modem-chip-chipsets |access-date=August 11, 2020 |website=[[The Verge]] |archive-date=October 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005222953/https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18635379/ftc-qualcomm-victory-lawsuit-court-anti-competitive-practices-modem-chip-chipsets |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nQualcomm appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]], which reversed the decision in August 2020. The Ninth Circuit determined that Judge Koh's decision strayed beyond the scope of antitrust law and that whether Qualcomm's patent licensing may be considered [[reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing]] does not fall within the scope of antitrust law, but rather is a matter of contract and patent law. The court concluded that the FTC failed to meet its burden of proof and that Qualcomm's business practices were better characterized as \"hypercompetitive\" rather than \"anticompetitive\".<ref>{{Cite
