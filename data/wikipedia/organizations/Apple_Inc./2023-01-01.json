Apple is the [[List of largest technology companies by revenue|largest technology company]] by revenue (totaling {{US$|365.8 billion|link=yes}} in 2021) and, {{As of|2022|June|lc=y}}, is the [[List of public corporations by market capitalization|world's biggest company]] by market capitalization, the [[Market share of personal computer vendors|fourth-largest personal computer vendor]] by unit sales and [[List of best-selling mobile phones#Annual sales by manufacturer|second-largest mobile phone manufacturer]]. It is one of the [[Big Tech|Big Five]] American [[information technology]] companies, alongside [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Meta Platforms|Meta]], and [[Microsoft]].\n\nApple was founded as '''Apple Computer Company''' on April 1, 1976, by  [[Steve Wozniak]], [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Ronald Wayne]] to develop and sell Wozniak's [[Apple I]] personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''' in 1977 and the company's next computer, the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced [[microcomputers]]. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, including the 1984 [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]], announced that year in [[1984 (advertisement)|a critically acclaimed advertisement]]. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded [[NeXT]], taking some Apple employees with him.\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable [[market share]] to the lower-priced duopoly of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system on [[Intel]]-powered [[PC clone]]s (also known as \"[[Wintel]]\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful [[operating system]] strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the [[iMac]], [[iPod]], [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] to critical acclaim, launching \"[[Think different]]\" and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the [[Apple Store]] retail chain, and [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple|acquiring numerous companies]] to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by [[Tim Cook]].\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be [[Trillion-dollar company|valued at over $1&nbsp;trillion]] in August 2018, then $2&nbsp;trillion in August 2020, and most recently $3&nbsp;trillion in January 2022. The company [[criticism of Apple Inc.|receives criticism]] regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including [[anti-competitive practices]] and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has [[Apple community|a large following]] and enjoys a high level of [[brand loyalty]]. It is ranked as one of the [[List of most valuable brands|world's most valuable brands]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Apple Inc.}}\n\n=== 1976\u20131980: Founding and incorporation ===\n{{See also|History of Apple Inc.#1971\u20131985: Jobs and Wozniak}}\n[[File:Apple Garage.jpg|thumb|In 1976, [[Steve Jobs]] co-founded Apple in his parents' home on Crist Drive in [[Los Altos, California]].{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=6\u20138}} Although it is widely believed that the company was founded in the house's garage, Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] called it \"a bit of a myth\".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gibbs |first=Samuel |date=December 5, 2014 |title=Steve Wozniak: Apple starting in a garage is a myth |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/05/steve-wozniak-apple-starting-in-a-garage-is-a-myth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425011132/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/05/steve-wozniak-apple-starting-in-a-garage-is-a-myth |archive-date=April 25, 2015 |access-date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Jobs and Wozniak did, however, move some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.<ref name=\"Linzmayer01\">{{Cite news |last=Linzmayer |first=Owen W. |title=Apple Confidential: The Real Story of Apple Computer, Inc |work=The Denver Post |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/books/chap0411h.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414125259/http://extras.denverpost.com/books/chap0411h.htm |archive-date=April 14, 2012}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Apple I Computer.jpg|thumb|Apple's first product, the [[Apple I]], designed by Steve Wozniak, was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case.

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the [[Apple ecosystem]] as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] did not have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Mac (computer)|Mac]] in close proximity).

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Though switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant. Improvements to Siri stalled, executives clashed, and there were disagreements over the restrictions imposed on third-party app interactions. While Apple acquired an England-based startup specializing in conversational assistants, Google's [[Google Assistant|Assistant]] had already become capable of helping users select Wi-Fi networks by voice, and Siri was lagging in functionality.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mickle|first=Tripp|date=June 7, 2017|title='I'm Not Sure I Understand'\u2014How Apple's Siri Lost Her Mojo|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-siri-once-an-original-now-struggles-to-be-heard-above-the-crowd-1496849095|url-access=subscription|access-date=December 14, 2017|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}; {{Cite web|last=Hardwick|first=Tim|date=June 8, 2017|title=Apple's Concern With User Privacy Reportedly Stifling Siri Development|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/08/apple-struggling-to-develop-siri-privacy|access-date=December 14, 2017|website=[[MacRumors]]}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, two articles from ''The Verge'' and ''[[ZDNet]]'' debated what had been a particularly devastating week for Apple's macOS and iOS software platforms.
