The company was incorporated by Wozniak and [[Steve Jobs]] in 1977. Its second computer, the [[Apple II (original)|Apple II]], became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced [[microcomputer]]s. Apple introduced the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] in 1983 and the [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a [[graphical user interface]] and a [[computer mouse|mouse]]. By 1985, the company's internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form [[NeXT, Inc.]], and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable [[market share]] to the lower-priced [[Wintel]] duopoly of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system on [[Intel]]-powered [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]].\n\nIn 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed [[operating system]] strategy and entice Jobs's return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the [[iMac]], [[iPod]], iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"[[Think different]]\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the [[Apple Store]] retail chain, and [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple|acquiring numerous companies]] to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by [[Tim Cook]].\n\nApple has received criticism regarding [[Apple supply chain|its contractors]]' labor practices, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including [[anti-competitive practices]] and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, it has [[Apple community|a large following]] and a high level of [[brand loyalty]]. It has been consistently ranked as one of the world's [[List of most valuable brands|most valuable brands]].\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be [[Trillion-dollar company|valued at over $1&nbsp;trillion]] in August 2018, then at $2&nbsp;trillion in August 2020, and at $3&nbsp;trillion in January 2022.

Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC's technology, leading to Apple's option to buy shares at a preferential rate. This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple's products, starting with the Apple Lisa. Despite being pioneering as a mass-marketed GUI computer, the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options, leading to commercial failure.\n\nJobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's [[Macintosh]] division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.<ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{Cite web |date=June 27, 2013 |title=Steve Wozniak on Newton, Tesla, and why the original Macintosh was a 'lousy' product |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312014832/http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life |archive-date=March 12, 2016 |access-date=June 25, 2018}}</ref> Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.<ref name=\"rice19850415\" />\n\nIn 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled [[programming language]].<ref name=\"IsProgramingObsolete\">{{Cite web |last=Harvey |first=Brian |date=1994 |title=Is Programing Obsolete? |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/obsolete.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000323/http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/obsolete.html |archive-date=October 5, 2013 |access-date=June 14, 2013 |publisher=Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, [[University of California, Berkeley]] }}</ref> Its debut was signified by \"[[1984 (advertisement)|1984]]\", a {{US$|1.5}}{{nbsp}}million television advertisement directed by [[Ridley Scott]] that aired during the third quarter of [[Super Bowl XVIII]] on January 22, 1984.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Friedman |first=Ted |title=Apple's 1984: The Introduction of the Macintosh in the Cultural History of Personal Computers |url=http://www.duke.edu/~tlove/mac.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014051705/http://www.duke.edu/~tlove/mac.htm |archive-date=October 14, 2012 }}</ref> This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success<ref>{{Cite news |last=Maney |first=Kevin |date=January 28, 2004 |title=Apple's '1984' Super Bowl commercial still stands as watershed event |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2004-01-28-maney_x.htm |access-date=April 18, 2017 |archive-date=March 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313054828/https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2004-01-28-maney_x.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> and was called a \"masterpiece\" by [[CNN]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leopold |first=Todd |date=February 3, 2006 |title=Why 2006 isn't like '1984' |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/02/02/eye.ent.commercials |access-date=April 18, 2017 |publisher=[[CNN]] |archive-date=April 5, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405133016/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/02/02/eye.ent.commercials |url-status=live }}</ref> and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by ''[[TV Guide]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 12, 1999 |title=The greatest commercials of all time |url=https://www.tvguide.com/tv/magazine/990628/ftr6.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991012071246/http://www.tvguide.com/tv/magazine/990628/ftr6.asp |archive-date=October 12, 1999 |access-date=April 18, 2017 |website=[[TV Guide]] }}; {{Cite web |first=Aaron |last=Taube |title=How The Greatest Super Bowl Ad Ever \u2013 Apple's '1984' \u2013 Almost Didn't Make It To Air |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-super-bowl-retrospective-2014-1 |website=[[Business Insider]] |date=January 22, 2014 |access-date=April 18, 2017 |archive-date=March 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330104642/https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-super-bowl-retrospective-2014-1 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe advertisement created great interest in [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]], and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in.

A study by [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Aten |first=Jason |date=May 12, 2021 |title=Apple's App Tracking Transparency Update Is Turning Out to Be the Worst-Case Scenario for Facebook |url=https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/apples-privacy-update-is-turning-out-to-be-worst-case-scenario-for-facebook.html |access-date=May 12, 2021 |website=Inc.com |language=en |archive-date=May 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210512071734/https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/apples-privacy-update-is-turning-out-to-be-worst-case-scenario-for-facebook.html |url-status=live }}; {{Cite web |title=New data shows how devastating Apple's new anti-tracking feature is for Facebook |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/new-data-shows-how-devastating-apple-e2-80-99s-new-anti-tracking-feature-is-for-facebook/ar-BB1gCVJc?ocid=BingNewsSearch |access-date=May 12, 2021 |website=www.msn.com |archive-date=May 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210512124835/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/new-data-shows-how-devastating-apple-e2-80-99s-new-anti-tracking-feature-is-for-facebook/ar-BB1gCVJc?ocid=BingNewsSearch |url-status=live }}; {{Cite web |date=May 8, 2021 |title=Just 4% of U.S. iPhone Users Let Apps Track Them With New iOS Update |url=https://gizmodo.com/too-bad-zuck-just-4-of-u-s-iphone-users-let-apps-tra-1846851013 |access-date=May 12, 2021 |website=Gizmodo |language=en-us |archive-date=May 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210512124834/https://gizmodo.com/too-bad-zuck-just-4-of-u-s-iphone-users-let-apps-tra-1846851013 |url-status=live }}; {{Cite web |last=Datti |first=Sharmishte |date=May 12, 2021 |title=Apple's App Tracking Transparency Becomes Facebook's Nightmare: Only 4% Allow Tracking |url=https://www.gizbot.com/mobile/news/apple-app-tracking-transparency-becomes-facebook-nightmare-only-4-percent-allow-tracking-074217.html |access-date=May 12, 2021 |website=www.gizbot.com |language=en |archive-date=June 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210604024443/https://www.gizbot.com/mobile/news/apple-app-tracking-transparency-becomes-facebook-nightmare-only-4-percent-allow-tracking-074217.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nPrior to the release of [[iOS 15]], Apple announced new efforts at combating [[Child pornography|child sexual abuse material]] on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor [[iMessage]] users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device [[Hash function|hashing]] would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates, however privacy advocates, including the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 5, 2021 |title=Apple to scan U.S. iPhones for images of child sexual abuse |url=https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-child-abuse-apple-inc-7fe2a09427d663cda8addfeeffc40196 |access-date=August 6, 2021 |website=AP NEWS |language=en |archive-date=August 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210805235943/https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-child-abuse-apple-inc-7fe2a09427d663cda8addfeeffc40196 |url-status=live }}; {{Cite news |last=Portnoy |first=India McKinney and Erica |date=August 5, 2021 |title=Apple's Plan to \"Think Different\" About Encryption Opens a Backdoor to Your Private Life |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life |access-date=August 6, 2021 |website=Electronic Frontier Foundation |language=en |archive-date=October 18, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221018221139/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIreland's [[Data Protection Commission]] launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's [[GDPR]] law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.<ref>{{Cite news |date=July 3, 2019 |title=Irish Regulator Opens Third Privacy Probe Into Apple |publisher=Gadgets360 |url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/apple-ireland-data-protection-commissioner-privacy-investigation-2063517 |access-date=July 24, 2019 |archive-date=July 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724113326/https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/apple-ireland-data-protection-commissioner-privacy-investigation-2063517 |url-status=live }}; {{Cite news |date=July 2, 2019 |title=Data Protection Commission opens privacy investigation into Apple |publisher=RTE |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2019/0702/1059764-apple-privacy |access-date=July 24, 2019 |archive-date=July 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724113325/https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2019/0702/1059764-apple-privacy/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, security researcher [[Brian Krebs]] discovered that the iPhone 11 Pro would still show the arrow indicator \u2013signifying location services are being used\u2013 at the top of the screen while the main location services toggle is enabled, despite all individual location services being disabled.

The BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing {{as of|2010|lc=true}}, but Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: \"We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions\".<ref name=\"Fire\" />\n\nIn December 2014, the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in \"primitive, dark and filthy dorms\" where they sleep \"on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.\" Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Jamieson |first=Dave |date=December 23, 2014 |title=The Factory Workers Behind Your iPhone Are Too Tired To Eat, Report Says |work=[[HuffPost]] |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/apple-zhen-ding-labor_n_6372294}}; [http://www.globallabourrights.org/reports/exhaustion-has-no-limit-at-apple-supplier-in-china Exhaustion Has No Limit at Apple Supplier in China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224223906/http://www.globallabourrights.org/reports/exhaustion-has-no-limit-at-apple-supplier-in-china|date=December 24, 2014}}.
