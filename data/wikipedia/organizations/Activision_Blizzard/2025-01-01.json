In 1988 the company expanded into non-gaming software and renamed itself Mediagenic. This venture was not successful, incurring heavy losses. In 1991 a group of investors led by [[Bobby Kotick]] bought the company. Kotick instituted a large restructuring to reduce debt, including renaming the company back to Activision and moving it to Santa Monica, California. By 1997 the company was profitable again. Kotick spent the next decade expanding Activision's products through [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] of around 25 studios. This resulted in Activision publishing several successful series of games, including ''[[Tony Hawk's (series)|Tony Hawk's]]'', ''[[Call of Duty]]'', and ''[[Guitar Hero]]''. However, by around 2006, the popularity of [[massively multiplayer online]] (MMO) games started to grow. Such games provide a constant revenue stream to their publishers, rather than only a single purchase, making them a more valuable proposition. None of Activision's subsidiaries had an MMO or the capability to make one quickly. Activision was also facing tougher competition from companies like [[Electronic Arts]], as well as slowdowns in sales of their key game series.<ref name=\"forbes kotick\">{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0202/052.html#788254c31a16 |title=Activision's Unlikely Hero |first=Peter |last=Beller |date=January 15, 2009 |access-date=February 12, 2019 |work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] |archive-date=August 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806105646/https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0202/052.html#788254c31a16 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAround 2006, Kotick reached out to [[Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy]], the [[CEO]] of the French media conglomerate [[Vivendi]]. Vivendi at that time had the games division [[Vivendi Games]], a holding company principally for [[Sierra Entertainment]] and [[Blizzard Entertainment]]. Kotick wanted to get access to Blizzard's ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', a successful MMO, and suggested a means to acquire this to L\u00e9vy. L\u00e9vy instead offered that he would be willing to merge Vivendi Games with Activision, but only if Vivendi kept majority control of the merged company. According to those close to Kotick, Kotick was concerned about this offer as it would force him to cede control of Activision. However, after talking to Blizzard's CEO [[Mike Morhaime]], Kotick recognized that Vivendi would be able to give them inroads into the growing video game market in China.<ref name=\"forbes kotick\" />\n\nKotick proposed the merger to Activision's board, which agreed to it in December 2007. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard and would retain its central headquarters in California. Bobby Kotick of Activision was announced as the new president and CEO, while Ren\u00e9 Penisson of Vivendi was appointed [[chairman]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Vivendi and Activision to Create Activision Blizzard - World's Largest, Most Profitable Pure-Play Video Game Publisher |url=http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=279372 |publisher=Activision.com |date=December 2, 2007 |access-date=January 6, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207161213/http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=279372 |archive-date=February 7, 2012}}</ref> The [[European Commission]] permitted the merger to take place in April 2008, approving that there weren't any [[European Union merger law|EU antitrust issues]] in the merger deal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/16/eu-greenlights-activision-vivendi-merger |title=EU greenlights Activision-Vivendi merger |last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420084009/http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/16/eu-greenlights-activision-vivendi-merger/ |archive-date=April 20, 2008 |access-date=May 3, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> On July 8, 2008, Activision announced that stockholders had agreed to merge, and the deal closed the next day for an estimated transaction amount of US$18.9 billion.<ref name=\"Merger Approved\">{{cite web |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/887/887251p1.html |title=Activision/Vivendi Games Merger Approved: Stockholders support Activision Blizzard venture |last=Thang |first=Jimmy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801174639/http://wii.ign.com/articles/887/887251p1.html |archive-date=August 1, 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:Bobby Kotick executive photo.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An approximately 48-year-old man looking and smiling at the camera.|[[Bobby Kotick]] ''(pictured in 2012)'' was the CEO of Activision Blizzard from 2008 to 2023]]\nVivendi became the combined company's majority shareholder at 54% of outstanding shares, equating to 52% if shares were to be fully diluted.<ref name=\"merger pr\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Activision Blizzard Merger Official |first=Leigh |last=Alexander |url=http://kotaku.com/5023049/activision-blizzard-merger-official |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |date=July 8, 2008 |access-date=January 15, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165325/http://kotaku.com/5023049/activision-blizzard-merger-official |archive-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> The rest of the shares were held by institutional and private investors, and were to be left open for trading on the [[NASDAQ]] stock market for a time under the ticker symbol ATVID, and subsequently as ATVI (Activision's stock ticker).
