This acquisition brought [[Neil Young]] into the company fold, initially as a member of [[Buffalo Springfield]]. Young became one of Warner's longest-established artists, recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the Warner-owned Atlantic, Atco, and Reprise labels. Young also recorded five albums for [[Geffen Records]] during that label's period of Warner distribution. The Geffen catalogue, now owned by [[Universal Music Group]], represents Young's only major recordings not under WMG ownership.\n\nAtlantic, its subsidiary [[Atco Records]], and its affiliate [[Stax Records]] paved the way for Warner's rise to industry prominence. The purchase brought in Atlantic's lucrative back catalogue, which included classic recordings by [[Ray Charles]], [[the Drifters]], [[the Coasters]], and many more. In the mid-1960s, Atlantic/Stax released a string of landmark [[soul music]] recordings by artists including [[Booker T & the MGs]], [[Sam & Dave]], [[Wilson Pickett]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Ben E. King]], and [[Aretha Franklin]]. Ultimately, the sale led to Stax leaving Atlantic because Seven Arts Productions insisted on keeping the rights to Stax recordings. Atlantic moved decisively into rock and pop in the late 1960s and 1970s, signing major British and American acts including [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Crosby Stills & Nash]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Average White Band]], [[Dr John]], [[King Crimson]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Roxy Music]], and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]].\n\nIn 1969, two years after being purchased by Seven Arts, the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts company was sold to the [[Kinney National Company]]. In mid-1972, Kinney Music of Canada, Ltd. was renamed [[Warner Music Canada|WEA Music of Canada, Ltd.]] (French: ''WEA Musique du Canada, Lt\u00e9e'') as the Canadian branch of the WEA (Warner, Elektra, Atlantic) company - a division of Warner Communications Inc. Founder and president Ken Middleton ran the Canadian company until his retirement in 1982. The name remained until 1989, when in 1990, it became Warner Music Canada Ltd - a subsidiary of the US-based Warner Music International. Warner Communications CEO [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]] led the group through its most successful period until his death in 1992.\n\nAn earlier attempt by Warner Bros. Records to create an in-house distribution arm in 1958 did not materialize. So in 1969, [[Elektra Records]] boss [[Jac Holzman]] approached Atlantic's [[Jerry Wexler]] with the idea of setting up a joint distribution network for Warner, Elektra, and Atlantic. An experimental branch was established in [[Southern California]] as a possible prototype for an expanded operation.<ref>{{cite news|title=WEA at 25|last=Seay|first=David|date=August 31, 1996|magazine=Billboard|page=36}}</ref>\n\n====Atlantic exerts autonomy====\nIt was soon apparent in 1969 that Atlantic/Atco president [[Ahmet Ertegun]] viewed Warner/Reprise president Mike Maitland as a rival. Maitland believed that, as vice-president in charge of the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts music division, he should have final say over all recording operations, and he further angered Ertegun by proposing that most of Atlantic's back-office functions (such as marketing and distribution) be combined with the existing departments at Warner/Reprise. In retrospect Ertegun clearly feared that Maitland would ultimately have more power than him, and so he moved rapidly to secure his own position and remove Maitland.\n\nMaitland had put off renegotiating the contracts of Joe Smith and Mo Ostin, the presidents of the Warner Bros. and Reprise labels, and this provided Ertegun with an effective means of undermining Maitland. When Wexler\u2014now a major shareholder\u2014found out about the contract issue he and Ertegun began pressuring [[Eliot Hyman]] to get Smith and Ostin under contract, ostensibly because they were worried that the two executives might move to rival labels\u2014and in fact Ostin had received overtures from both the MGM and ABC labels.\n\nIn 1969, the wisdom of Hyman's investments was proved when [[Kinney National Company]] purchased Warner Bros.-Seven Arts for $400 million, more than eight times what Hyman had paid for Warner/Reprise and Atlantic combined. From the base of his family's funeral parlour business, Kinney president [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]] had rapidly built the Kinney company into a profitable conglomerate with interests that included comic publishing, the [[Ashley-Famous]] talent agency, parking lots and cleaning services. Following the takeover, Warners' music group briefly adopted the 'umbrella' name Kinney Music, because U.S. anti-trust laws at the time prevented the three labels from trading as one.\n\nRoss was primarily focused on rebuilding the company's ailing movie division and was happy to defer to the advice of the managers of the company's record labels, since he knew that they were generating most of the group's profits. Ertegun's campaign against Maitland began in earnest that summer. Atlantic had agreed to help Warner Bros. in its efforts to establish its labels overseas, beginning with its soon-to-be-established Warner Bros. subsidiary in Australia, but when Warner executive Phil Rose arrived in Australia, he discovered that just one week earlier Atlantic had signed a new four-year distribution deal with a rival local label, [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]] (owned by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Limited]]). Mike Maitland complained bitterly to Kinney executive [[Ted Ashley]], but to no avail \u2013 by this time Ertegun was poised to make his move against Maitland.<ref>Goodman, 1997, p. 146</ref>\n\nAs he had with Hyman, Ertegun urged Steve Ross to extend Mo Ostin and Joe Smith's contracts, a recommendation Ross was happy to accept. Ostin however had received overtures from other companies including [[MGM Records]] and [[ABC Records]] and when he met with Ertegun in January 1970 and was offered Maitland's job, he was unwilling to re-sign immediately. In response, Ertegun broadly hinted that Maitland's days were numbered and that he, Ertegun, was about to take over the recording division.\n\nUnlike the Warner/Reprise executives, Atlantic's execs the Ertegun brothers (Ahmet and Neshui) and Wexler owned stock in Kinney.<ref name=\"rhino.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/article/stay-tuned-by-stan-cornyn-maitland-moves-on|title=Stay Tuned By Stan Cornyn: Maitland Moves On|work=rhino.com|access-date=February 2, 2015|archive-date=February 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202200329/http://www.rhino.com/article/stay-tuned-by-stan-cornyn-maitland-moves-on|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOstin was understandably concerned that, if he accepted the position, the Warner Bros. staff would feel that he had stabbed Maitland in the back, but his attorney convinced him that Maitland's departure was inevitable, regardless of whether or not he accepted the post (succinctly advising him, \"Don't be a schmuck\"). On Sunday January 25, Ted Ashley went to Maitland's house to tell him he had been dismissed, and Maitland declined the offer of a job at the movie studio. One week later, Mo Ostin was named as the new President of Warner Bros. Records, with Joe Smith as his executive vice-president.<ref>Goodman, 1997, pp. 146\u2013147</ref> Ertegun nominally remained the head of Atlantic, but since both Ostin and Smith owed their new positions to him, Ertegun was now the ''de facto'' head of the Warner music division. Ertegun was given the formal title of executive vice-president-Music Group.<ref name=\"rhino.com\"/> Maitland moved to [[MCA Records]] later that year and successfully consolidated MCA's labels, which he couldn't do at Warner.\n\n===1970s===\nDuring the 1970s, the Kinney group built up a commanding position in the music industry. In 1970, Kinney bought [[Elektra Records]] and its sister label [[Nonesuch Records]] (founded by Jac Holzman in 1950) for $10 million, bringing in leading rock acts, including [[the Doors]], [[Tim Buckley]], and [[Love (band)|Love]], and its historically significant folk archive, along with the successful budget Western classical-music label [[Nonesuch Records]].\n\nThe purchase of Elektra-Nonesuch brought a rich back catalogue of folk music as well as the renowned Nonesuch catalogue of classical and world music. Elektra founder Jac Holzman ran the label under Warners for two years, but by that time, he was by his own admission \"burnt out\" after twenty years in the business. Kinney president Steve Ross subsequently appointed Holzman as part of a seven-person \"[[brain trust]]\" tasked with investigating opportunities presented by new technologies, a role Holzman was eager to accept.<ref>Goodman, 1997, p. 248</ref> The same year, the group established its first overseas offices in Canada and Australia. By that time the \"Seven Arts\" moniker was dropped from the Warner Bros. name. Warner Bros. also founded the [[Casablanca Records]] subsidiary, headed by [[Neil Bogart]]; but several years later Casablanca became independent from Warner Bros.\n\n====Warner-Elektra-Atlantic and worldwide distribution====\n{{Anchor|Warner-Elektra-Atlantic|WEA}}\nWith the Elektra acquisition, the next step was forming an in-house distribution arm for the co-owned labels. By this time, Warner-Reprise's frustrations with its current distributors had reached breaking point; Joe Smith (then executive vice-president of Warner Bros.) recalled that the [[Grateful Dead]] were becoming a major act but the distributor was constantly out of stock of their albums. These circumstances facilitated the full establishment of the group's in-house distribution arm, initially called Kinney Record Group International.<ref name=\"Kinney Record Group International\">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/640338-Kinney-Record-Group-International|title=Kinney Record Group International|website=Discogs.com|access-date=December 9, 2017|archive-date=December 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210071820/https://www.discogs.com/label/640338-Kinney-Record-Group-International|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Seay40>Seay, 1996, p. 40</ref> By late 1972, US anti-trust laws had changed and the company was renamed '''Warner-Elektra-Atlantic''', WEA for short, which was renamed Warner Music in 1991 (the word \"group\" was added after the formation of [[AOL Time Warner]] in 2001).\n\nWEA was an early champion of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] rock music. Several such bands, including three major British pioneers [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], and [[Deep Purple]], were all signed to WEA's labels, at least in the United States. Among the earliest American metal acts to be signed to WEA were [[Alice Cooper]], [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]], and [[Van Halen]].\n\nUp to this point the Kinney-owned record companies had relied on licensing deals with overseas record labels to manufacture, distribute and promote its products in other countries; concurrent with the establishment of its new distribution arm, the company now began establishing subsidiaries in the other major markets, beginning with the creation of Warner Bros. Records Australia in 1970, soon followed by branch offices in the UK, Europe and Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ketupa.net/time3.htm|title=Time Warner: Landmarks|work=ketupa.net|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217133642/http://ketupa.net/time3.htm|archive-date=February 17, 2011}}</ref> In July 1971, the new in-house distribution company was incorporated as Warner-Elektra-Atlantic Distributing Corp. (WEA) and branch offices were established in eight major US cities; Joel Friedman a one-time ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' writer who had been the head of Warner's advertising/merchandising division in its early years, was appointed to head WEA's US domestic division, and Ahmet Ertegun's brother [[Nesuhi Ertegun|Nesuhi]] was appointed to oversee its international operations. Neshui Ertegun, originally a Turkish native like his brother, displayed a global perspective and independence from its U.S. counterpart by successfully promoting international acts in their target markets worldwide. Ertegun headed WEA International until his retirement in 1987. A ''de facto'' committee of three senior marketing executives\u2014Dave Glew from Atlantic, Ed Rosenblatt from Warner Bros. and Mel Posner from Elektra\u2014oversaw the integration of each label's marketing and distribution through the new division,<ref name=Seay40/> but each label continued to operate totally independently in [[A&R]] matters and also applied their own expertise in marketing and advertising.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kinney Set Up Distrib Corp To Handle Labels in 8 Key Cities|magazine=Billboard|date=July 3, 1971|page=3}}</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 1971, following the pattern set by similar joint ventures in Canada and Australia, the Warner labels entered into a partnership with the British arm of <!-- which did not then have the rights to use the Columbia name. -->[[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] to press and distribute Warner-Reprise product in the United Kingdom, although this was undertaken as a cooperative venture rather than a formally incorporated business partnership. The ''Billboard'' article that reported the new arrangement also noted that, despite their intense competition in the US market, CBS continued to press Warner-Reprise recordings in the US. However the new UK arrangement was a major blow to Warner's previous British manufacturer [[Pye Records]], for whom Warner-Reprise had been their largest account. With the scheduled addition of the UK rights to the Atlantic catalogue, which would revert to Kinney in early 1972, ''Billboard'' predicted that the Warner-CBS partnership would have a 25\u201330% share of the UK music market.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kinney-CBS Enters Joint Distrib and Pressing Deal in England|last=Blevins|first=Brian|date=March 27, 1971|magazine=Billboard|page=54}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1971, thanks mainly to the influence of Ahmet Ertegun, the Kinney group announced a major coup with its acquisition of the worldwide rights to [[the Rolling Stones]]' new label [[Rolling Stones Records]], following the expiration of the band's contract with [[Decca Records|British Decca]] (then separate from the American label) and the acrimonious end to their business relationship with their former manager [[Allen Klein]].

The band signed with Reprise in the early 1970s after relocating to the US, and the label supported the group through numerous lineup changes and several lean years during which the band's records sold relatively poorly, although they remained a popular concert attraction. Ironically, after the group's transfer to Warner Bros. in 1975 and the recruitment of new members [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]], the group scored a major international hit with the single \"Rhiannon\" and consolidated with the best selling albums ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'', ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' and ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]''.\n\n====Warner Communications====\nDue to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations, Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in 1972 (as [[National Kinney Corporation]]) and changed its name to [[WarnerMedia#Warner Communications (1972\u20131990)|Warner Communications Inc.]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5uQoR6o7U4C&q=kinney&pg=PT290|title=Master of the Game: How Steve Ross Rode the Light Fantastic from Undertaker to Creator of the Largest Media Conglomerate in the World|last=Bruck|first=Connie.|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2013|isbn=9781476737706|location=Riverside|oclc=1086102756|access-date=October 23, 2020|archive-date=March 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309201531/https://books.google.com/books?id=s5uQoR6o7U4C&q=kinney&pg=PT290|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, the Warner group acquired another rich prize, [[David Geffen]]'s [[Asylum Records]]. The $7 million purchase brought in several acts that proved crucial to WEA's subsequent success, including [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[the Eagles]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Joni Mitchell]], and later [[Warren Zevon]]. On the downside, however, it was rumored that Warner was soon concerned about its possible liability under the California State Labor Code because of Geffen's questionable status as both the manager of most of the Asylum acts and the head of the record label to which they were signed. The sale included the Asylum Records label and its recordings, as well as Geffen's lucrative music publishing assets and the interests in the royalties of some of the artists managed by Geffen and partner [[Elliot Roberts]]. Geffen accepted a five-year contract with WCI and turned over his 75% share in the Geffen-Roberts management company to Roberts and Warner paid Geffen and Roberts 121,952 common shares worth $4,750,000 at the time of the sale, plus $400,000 in cash and a further $1.6 million in promissory notes convertible to common stock.<ref>Goodman, 1997, pp. 240\u2013241</ref>\n\nAlthough it seemed a lucrative deal at the time, Geffen soon had reason to regret it. Uncharacteristically, he had greatly underestimated the value of his assets\u2014within Asylum's first year as a Warner subsidiary, albums by [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[the Eagles]] alone had earned more than the entire value of the Asylum sale. Geffen's discomfort was compounded by the fact that, within six months of the sale, the value of his volatile Warner shares had plummeted from $4.5 million to just $800,000. He appealed to Steve Ross to intervene, and as part of a make-good deal, Ross agreed to pay him the difference in the share value over five years. Acting on Jac Holzman's suggestion that Kinney should take Asylum from Atlantic and merge it with Elektra, Ross then appointed Geffen to run the new combined label.<ref>Goodman, 1997, pp. 249\u2013250</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Warner gained a brief early lead in digital media when it purchased the [[Atari]] computer company, and in 1981 it bought [[The Franklin Mint]] company. WCI also blazed the trail in visual music with MTV, which it created and co-owned in partnership with [[American Express]]. In 1984\u201385, Warner rapidly divested many of these recent acquisitions, including Atari, Franklin Mint, [[Panavision]], [[MTV Networks]] and a cosmetics business.\n\nIn 1977, Warner Bros. Music, led by president Ed Silvers, formed Pacific Records for their composers and distributed (appropriately) by [[Atlantic Records]]. [[Alan O'Day]] was the first artist signed to the label, and the first release was \"[[Undercover Angel (song)|Undercover Angel]]\". The song, which he described as a \"nocturnal novelette\", was released in February 1977. Within a few months it had become No. 1 in the country, and has sold approximately two million copies. It was also a hit in Australia, reaching No. 9 on the Australian Singles Chart. \"Undercover Angel\" also landed O'Day in an exclusive club as one of only a handful of writers/performers to pen a No. 1 hit for themselves and a No. 1 for another artist.<ref name=\"cashboxtop1001977\">{{cite web|url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19770702.html|title=Cash Box Top 100 7/02/77|website=Tropicalglen.com|access-date=December 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020124149/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19770702.html|archive-date=October 20, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"superseventies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/1977_4singles.html|title=\"Undercover Angel\" - Alan O'Day|website=Superseventies.com|access-date=December 9, 2017|archive-date=December 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210071916/https://www.superseventies.com/1977_4singles.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nNew signings in the late 1970s placed WEA in a strong position for the 1980s. A deal with [[Seymour Stein]]'s [[Sire Records]] label (which Warner Bros. Records later took over) brought in several major [[punk rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] acts including [[the Pretenders]], [[the Ramones]] and [[Talking Heads]] and, most importantly, rising star [[Madonna]]; Elektra signed [[the Cars]] and Warner Bros. signed [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], giving WEA several of the biggest-selling acts of the decade.\n\nWEA's labels also distributed a number of otherwise independent labels. For example, Warner Bros. distributed [[Straight Records]], [[DiscReet Records]], [[Bizarre Records]], [[Bearsville Records]], and [[Geffen Records]] (the latter was sold to [[MCA Inc.|MCA]] in 1990). Atlantic Records distributed [[Swan Song Records]]. In 1975, WEA scored a major coup by signing a distribution agreement with [[Island Records]], which only covered the United States and select other countries. For the next 14 years (initially with Warner Bros. until 1982, then with Atlantic afterward), WEA would distribute such artists as [[Bob Marley]], [[U2]], [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[Tom Waits]].

WEA was renamed Warner Music in 1991.\n\nAtlantic launched two new subsidiary labels in the early 1990s: [[East West Records]] and [[Interscope Records]]. In 1995, East West absorbed Atco Records and was eventually folded into Elektra Records. In 1996, after causing much controversy, Interscope was purchased by [[MCA Inc.|MCA Music Entertainment]].\n\nDuring 1992, Warner Music faced one of the most serious public-relations crises in its history when a major controversy erupted over the provocative Warner Bros. recording \"[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]\" from the self-titled album by [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]], a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]/[[rap]] fusion band led by [[Ice-T]]. Unfortunately for Warner, the song (which mentioned the [[Rodney King]] case) was issued just before the controversial acquittal of the police charged with King's beating, which sparked the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]] and the confluence of events put the song under the national spotlight. Complaints escalated over the summer\u2014conservative police associations called for a boycott of Time Warner products, politicians including President [[George H. W. Bush]] denounced the label for releasing the song, Warner executives received death threats, Time Warner stockholders threatened to pull out of the company and the New Zealand police commissioner unsuccessfully tried to have the record banned there. Although Ice-T later voluntarily reissued ''Body Count'' without \"Cop Killer\", the furor seriously rattled Warner Music and in January 1993 the label made an undisclosed deal releasing Ice-T from his contract and returning the ''[[Body Count (album)|Body Count]]'' master tapes to him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/29/arts/ice-t-and-warner-are-parting-company.html|title=Ice-T and Warner Are Parting Company|last=Rule|first=Sheila|date=January 29, 1993|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=August 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829233827/https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/29/arts/ice-t-and-warner-are-parting-company.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1992, the [[Rhino Records]] label signed a distribution agreement with Atlantic Records and Time Warner bought a 50% stake in the Rhino Records label. The distribution agreement allowed Rhino to begin reissuing recordings from Atlantic's back catalogue.\n\nIn 1994, Canadian beverage giant [[Seagram]] bought a 14.5% stake in Time Warner, and the Warner publishing division \u2014 now called [[Warner/Chappell Music]] \u2013 acquired CPP/Belwin, becoming the world's largest owner of song copyrights and the world's largest publisher of printed music. In 1996, Time Warner made another dramatic expansion of its media holdings, taking over the [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which by then included the Turner cable TV network, [[CNN]] and the screen production houses [[Castle Rock Entertainment]] and [[New Line Cinema]], acquisitions that brought huge profits into the Warner Group thanks to content assets like ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and the highly successful ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy.\n\nBy the early 1990s, senior Warner staff like Ostin and Waronker had remained in their positions for several decades\u2014a highly unusual situation in the American music industry\u2014but the death of Steve Ross destabilized the Time Warner hierarchy, and over the next few years the music group was increasingly disrupted by internal power struggles, leading to a string of major executive upheavals in 1994\u201395, which ''The New York Times'' described as \"a virtual civil war\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/01/business/the-media-business-rifts-shake-and-rattle-warner-music.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Rifts Shake and Rattle Warner Music|last=Hofmeister|first=Sallie|date=November 1, 1994|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=August 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823194048/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/01/business/the-media-business-rifts-shake-and-rattle-warner-music.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe central conflict was between Mo Ostin and Warner Music Group chairman Robert Morgado, who had joined the Warner group in the late 1980s. Because of his political background (he had been the chief-of-staff to former New York governor [[Hugh L. Carey]]) and his lack of music industry experience \u2014 especially compared to the widely revered Ostin\u2014Morgado was viewed as an outsider at Warner. Nevertheless, he gained favour with Ross and Levin and was promoted in 1985 to oversee the Warner international music division after helping the company slash costs in its computer game sector.<ref name=\"Philips1995-05-03\"/>\n\nSince his appointment as head of WBR, Ostin had always reported directly to Steve Ross and his successor [[Gerald Levin]], but in late 1993, when Ostin's contract came up for renewal, Morgado asserted his authority, insisting that Ostin should now report directly to him. The tensions between them reached boiling point in July 1994 when Morgado appointed former Atlantic chief [[Doug Morris]] to head the Warner Music Group in the US, a decision that many saw as a deliberate move to hasten the departure of Ostin and Elektra head [[Bob Krasnow|Robert Krasnow]].<ref name=\"Philips1995-05-03\"/> Morgado's new structure was announced in August 1994 and Bob Krasnow resigned from Elektra the next day. Within days, after more than 30 years with the Warner music group and more than 20 years as president and chairman of Warner Bros. Records, Ostin announced he would not renew his current contract and would leave Warners when it expired on December 31, 1994. There was more negative publicity the following month, when leading Elektra act [[Metallica]] launched a lawsuit against the label, seeking a release from their contract and ownership of their master tapes, and claiming that Morgado had refused to honor a deal they had worked out with Krasnow before he quit.\n\nOstin's departure marked a seismic shift in the corporate culture at WBR and the news was greeted with dismay by industry insiders and the many artists whose careers he had helped to nurture. Lenny Waronker had agreed to take over as WBR chairman and CEO but in October 1994 he announced that he would not be taking up the position; he initially said that he would remain as President of WBR, but by this time there was already widespread speculation that he would leave, and he did so soon afterwards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-16/business/fi-27820_1_warner-bros|title=Company Town at Warner Bros.

Morgado had resisted making a decision about increasing the Warner stake in Interscope, which encouraged other companies to make overtures to the label; in response, Morgado threatened to send cease-and-desist notices to executives at several record companies, demanding that they stop approaching Interscope with buyout offers, a move that reportedly infuriated Iovine.<ref name=\"Philips1995-05-03\"/>\n\nBy late 1994, Morris was gaining the upper hand over his rival and media reports claimed that Morris had moved to settle with Metallica, offering a deal that was reportedly even more generous than the one they had worked out with Krasnow. Morgado now faced a showdown with Morris, who felt he was not being allowed to run WMG as he saw fit. In October 1994, Morris and 11 other Warner executives \"staged an unprecedented insurrection that nearly paralyzed the world's largest record company\".<ref name=\"Philips1995-05-03\"/> This led to a climactic meeting between Morris and Gerald Levin in late October, at which Morris reportedly threatened to quit if he had to continue to report to Morgado.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/28/business/the-media-business-warner-music-officials-settle-a-power-struggle.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Warner Music Officials Settle a Power Struggle|last=Hofmeister|first=Sallie|date=October 28, 1994|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=August 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829233826/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/28/business/the-media-business-warner-music-officials-settle-a-power-struggle.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMorgado gave in to the demand that Morris be granted autonomy to run the North American operations and he was forced to upgrade Morris's position from chief operating officer to Chief Executive of Warner Music Group (US); Morris promptly named [[Danny Goldberg]], former president of Atlantic Records, to run WBR in defiance of Morgado, who had a different candidate in mind and Levin also reduced Morgado's power to oversee Warner's mail-order record club division and its international operations.<ref name=\"Landler1995-05-04\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/04/business/the-media-business-time-warner-replaces-chairman-of-music-group-with-hbo-chief.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Time Warner Replaces Chairman Of Music Group With HBO Chief|last=Landler|first=Mark|date=May 4, 1995|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=August 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829233824/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/04/business/the-media-business-time-warner-replaces-chairman-of-music-group-with-hbo-chief.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Philips1995-05-03\"/> Morris then brought in [[Sylvia Rhone]] and [[Seymour Stein]] to stabilize Elektra, settled the Metallica lawsuit and persuaded Levin to purchase an additional 25% of Interscope, although this initiative proved short-lived.<ref name=\"Philips1995-05-03\"/>\n\nThe power struggle between Morgado and Morris reached a dramatic climax in May 1995 when Morgado was asked to resign by Gerald Levin, following a welter of complaints from executives at the three major Warner Music labels, who said that Morgado was undermining Morris's authority and damaging Warner's reputation among performers.<ref name=\"Landler1995-05-04\" /> Morgado was immediately replaced by [[Home Box Office|HBO]] chairman [[Michael J. Fuchs]] but the corporate upheavals did not end there; in late June 1995 Fuchs abruptly dismissed Doug Morris, saying that Morris had been \"leading a campaign to destabilize Warner Music in an effort to seize control of the company\". As Morris's strongest ally, Danny Goldberg was also under threat; he was initially told that he could stay on as President of WBR as long as he refrained from office politics and concentrate on the day-to-day management of the label, but he resigned as President of Warner Bros. Records soon after to pursue \"other interests\", and was replaced by WBR vice-chairman [[Russ Thyret]].\n\nDespite early success with [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], and Morris's decision to increase Warner's stake to 50%, by the mid-1990s [[Interscope Records]] was being seen as a liability for the Warner group. Time Warner's board and investors had already been bruised by the damaging 1992 \"[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]\" controversy and now they were faced with renewed criticism about the [[gangsta rap]] genre, in which Interscope's associate imprint [[Death Row Records]] was a key label. In mid-1995, Time Warner refused to distribute the Interscope album ''[[Dogg Food]]'' by [[Tha Dogg Pound]], forcing the label to seek outside distribution, and late in the year TW sold its stake in Death Row back to co-owners [[Jimmy Iovine]] and Ted Field and soon after it sold off its share in Interscope to [[MCA Music Entertainment]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/28/business/time-warner-to-sell-stake-in-rap-label.html|title=Time Warner to Sell Stake in Rap Label|last=Landler|first=Mark|date=September 28, 1995|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=August 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829233825/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/28/business/time-warner-to-sell-stake-in-rap-label.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe upheaval at Warner was beneficial to its rivals, who picked up valuable executives who had left Warner. Goldberg moved over to [[Mercury Records]]; Morris joined [[MCA Records|MCA Music Entertainment Group]] and led its reorganization into [[Universal Music Group]], now the world's largest record company. In November 1995, Fuchs was himself sacked by Levin, leaving the company with a reported US$60 million \"[[golden parachute]]\", and Time Warner co-chairmen [[Robert A.

This spinoff was completed on February 27, 2004. In the 2004 transition to independent ownership, WMG hired record industry heavyweight [[Lyor Cohen]] from [[Universal Music Group]] (the result of the merger between the PolyGram and MCA label families) to attempt to reduce cost and increase performance. Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery) no longer retains any ownership in WMG, though it had the option to reacquire up to 20% of WMG for three years following the closing of the transaction.

Like its rival EMI, Warner reacted to the growth of the digital music market by making a historic change, moving out of record production by closing or selling off disc-pressing plants, particularly in territories such as the US and the Netherlands, where production costs are high. The US manufacturing operations were sold to [[Cinram]] in 2003, before the purchase from Time Warner.\n\nIn 2005, the Miami-based Warner Bros.

Music}}\n\n[[Warner Chappell Music]] dates back to 1811 and the creation of [[Chappell & Company]], a sheet music and instrument merchant in London. In 1929, [[Jack L. Warner]], president of Warner Bros. Pictures Inc., founded Music Publishers Holding Company (MPHC) to acquire music copyrights as a means of providing inexpensive music for films and, in 1987, Warner Bros.' corporate parent, Warner Communications, acquired Chappell & Company from [[PolyGram]]. Its printed music operation, Warner Bros. Publications, was sold to [[Alfred Music]] on June 1, 2005.\n\nAmong the historic compositions of which the publishing rights are controlled by WMG are the works of [[Cole Porter]], [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]. In the 1930s and 1940s, Chappell Music also ran a profitable orchestration division for Broadway musicals, with house arrangers of the caliber of [[Robert Russell Bennett]], [[Don Walker (orchestrator)|Don Walker]], [[Ted Royal]] and [[Hans Spialek]]. Between them they had orchestrated about 90% of the productions seen up to late 1941.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Boys That Make the Noise|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=July 5, 1943}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Companies}}\n* [[List of record labels]]\n* [[List of Warner Music Group artists]]\n* [[List of Warner Music Group labels]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|author=Fred Goodman|title=The Mansion on the Hill: Dylan, Young, Geffen, Springsteen and the Head-on Collision of Rock and Commerce|publisher=Jonathan Cape/Random House|year=1997|isbn=978-0679743774}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official|https://www.wmg.com}}\n{{Finance links\n| name = Warner Music Group\n| symbol = WMG\n| reuters = WMG.O\n| bloomberg = WMG:US\n| sec_cik = WMG\n| yahoo = WMG\n| google = WMG\n| nasdaq = WMG\n}}\n\n{{Warner Music Group}}\n{{Tencent}}\n{{Music industry}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Warner Music Group| ]]\n[[Category:Record label distributors]]\n[[Category:IFPI members]]\n[[Category:Tencent]]\n[[Category:Multi-channel networks]]\n[[Category:Companies based in New York City]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1958]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1958]]\n[[Category:Holding companies established in 1958]]\n[[Category:Holding companies based in New York City]]\n[[Category:Mass media companies established in 1958]]\n[[Category:1958 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Companies formerly listed on the New York Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the Nasdaq]]\n[[Category:Bain Capital companies]]\n[[Category:Providence Equity Partners companies]]\n[[Category:Private equity portfolio companies]]\n[[Category:Former Time Warner subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:Publicly traded companies based in New York City]]\n[[Category:2011 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:2005 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:2020 initial public offerings]]"}
