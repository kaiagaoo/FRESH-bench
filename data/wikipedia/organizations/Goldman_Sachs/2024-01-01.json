According to a report by the United States Office of the Inspector General of [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP]], if AIG had collapsed, it would have made it difficult for Goldman to liquidate its trading positions with AIG, even at discounts, and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that \"might have made it difficult for Goldman Sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an AIG default.\" Finally, the report said, an AIG default would have forced Goldman Sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/30823-sigtarp-initial-report-to-the-congress |title=SIGTARP Initial Report to Congress|last=Barofsky |first=Neil |date=February 6, 2009 |publisher=[[United States Department of Treasury]]}}</ref> Goldman argued that CDSs are [[Mark-to-market|marked to market]] (i.e. valued at their current market price) and their positions netted between counterparties daily. Thus, as the cost of insuring AIG's obligations against default rose substantially in the lead-up to its bailout, the sellers of the CDS contracts had to post more [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] to Goldman Sachs. The firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an AIG bankruptcy and the risk of knock-on defaults, had AIG been allowed to fail.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123967007321015621 |title=Goldman Protected Its Clients From AIG's Weakness |last=van Praag |first=Lucas|date=April 14, 2009 | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | url-access=subscription}}</ref> However, in practice, the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an AIG bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2009/04/14/did-we-need-to-bail-out-aig |title=Did we need to bail out AIG? |date=April 14, 2009| newspaper=[[The Economist]]}}</ref>\n\n====Possible benefits from attendance at September 15, 2008, meetings at the New York Federal Reserve====\nAlthough many have said there is no evidence to support the claim,<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://news.wpcarey.asu.edu/20090706-cost-capital-goldman-sachs-extreme-makeover | title=The cost of capital: Goldman Sachs' extreme makeover | work=[[Arizona State University]] | date=July 6, 2009}}</ref> some have argued that Goldman Sachs received preferential treatment from the government by participating in the crucial September meetings at the New York Fed, which decided AIG's fate.
