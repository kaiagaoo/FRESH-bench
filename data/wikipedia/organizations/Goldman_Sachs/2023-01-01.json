We found this issue by asking mortgage mavens to pick the worst deal they knew of that had been floated by a top-tier firm - and this one's pretty bad.\nIt was sold by Goldman Sachs - GSAMP originally stood for Goldman Sachs Alternative Mortgage Products but now has become a name itself, like [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]] and [[3M]].\nThis issue, which is backed by ultra-risky second-mortgage loans, contains all the elements that facilitated the housing bubble and bust. It's got speculators searching for quick gains in hot housing markets; it's got loans that seem to have been made with little or no serious analysis by lenders; and finally, it's got Wall Street, which churned out mortgage \"product\" because buyers wanted it.

As the market began its downturn, Goldman \"created even more of these securities\", no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but, according to business journalist Gretchen Morgenson, \"enabling it to pocket huge profits\" from the mortgage defaults and that Goldman \"used the C.D.O.'s to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes\".<ref name=\"NewYorkTimes2009December24MorgensonGretchen\" /> Authors Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera stated that \"the firm's later insistence that it was merely a 'market maker' in these transactions - implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients - became less true over time\"-<ref>{{cite book | author=McLean and Nocera | title=All the Devils Are Here | page=271}}</ref>\n\nThe investments were called [[synthetic CDO]]s because unlike regular [[collateralized debt obligation]]s, the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans, but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults - the insurance known as \"[[credit default swap]]s\". Goldman and some other hedge funds held a \"short\" position in the securities, paying the premiums, while the investors (insurance companies, pension funds, etc.) receiving the premiums were the \"long\" position. The longs were responsible for paying the insurance \"claim\" to Goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted.
