Huang suggested the name Nvidia,<ref name=\"Witt\" /> from \"[[invidia]]\", the Latin word for \"envy\".<ref name=\"fortune-interview-2017\" /> The company's original headquarters office was in [[Sunnyvale, California]].<ref name=\"fortune-interview-2017\" />\n\n=== First graphics accelerator ===\nNvidia's first graphics accelerator product, the [[NV1]], was optimized for processing

on the wrong technology, Nvidia was confronted with a painful dilemma: keep working on its inferior chip for the Dreamcast even though it was already too far behind the competition, or stop working and run out of money right away.<ref name=\"wsj cohen 2024\" />\n\nEventually, Sega's president at the time, [[Shoichiro Irimajiri]], came to visit Huang in person to deliver the news that Sega was going with another graphics chip vendor for the Dreamcast.<ref name=\"wsj cohen 2024\" /> However, Irimajiri still believed in Huang, and \"wanted to make Nvidia successful\".<ref name=\"wsj cohen 2024\" /> Despite Nvidia's disappointing failure to deliver on its contract, Irimajiri somehow managed to convince Sega's management to invest $5 million into Nvidia.<ref name=\"wsj cohen 2024\" /> Years later, Huang explained that this was all the money Nvidia had left at the time, and that Irimajiri's \"understanding and generosity gave us six months to live\".<ref name=\"wsj cohen 2024\" />\n\nIn 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia's employees\u2014then around 100\u2014and focused the company's remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the [[RIVA 128]].<ref name=\"Witt\" /><ref name=\"Peddie\" /> By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia was down to about 40 employees<ref

gave rise to \"the unofficial company motto\": \"Our company is thirty days from going out of business\".<ref name=\"Witt\" /> Huang routinely began presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years.<ref name=\"Witt\" />\n\nNvidia sold about a million RIVA 128s in about four months<ref name=\"Witt\" /> and used the revenue to develop its next generation of products.<ref name=\"Peddie\"

Running at 120&nbsp;MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.\n\nDue to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project took many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the [[GeForce 2 Series|GeForce2 GTS]] shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival [[3dfx Interactive|3dfx]], a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=NVIDIA to Acquire 3dfx Core Graphics Assets |date=December 15, 2000 |location=Santa Clara, CA |url=https://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_20010612_6602.html |last1=Perez |first1=Derek |last2=Hara |first2=Michael |access-date=January 23, 2017 |archive-date=March 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330171444/https://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_20010612_6602.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite press release |title=3dfx Announces Three Major Initiatives To Protect Creditors and Maximize Shareholder Value |date=December 15, 2000 |location=San Jose, CA |url=http://3dfx.com/rel-15dec_2.htm |quote=Board of Directors Initiates Cost-Cutting Measures, Recommends to Shareholders Sale of Company Assets to NVIDIA Corporation for $112 million and Dissolution of Company |last1=Leupp |first1=Alex |last2=Sellers |first2=Scott |access-date=January 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010205193000/http://3dfx.com/rel-15dec_2.htm |archive-date=February 5, 2001 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kanellos |first=Michael |date=April 11, 2002 |title=Nvidia buys out 3dfx graphics chip business |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidia-buys-out-3dfx-graphics-chip-business/ |access-date=January 23, 2017 |website=[[CNET]] |archive-date=January 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119063532/https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidia-buys-out-3dfx-graphics-chip-business/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, [[S&P Global Ratings|Standard & Poor's]] selected Nvidia to replace the departing [[Enron]] in the [[S&P 500]] stock index, meaning that [[index fund]]s would need to hold Nvidia shares going forward.<ref name=\"Popina\">{{cite news |last1=Popina |first1=Elena |last2=Menton |first2=Jess |title=Nvidia Is the Latest Shiny Object to Spur Stocks to New Heights |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-06/nvidia-ai-stocks-are-latest-trend-to-send-s-p-500-to-new-highs |access-date=March 6, 2024 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=March 6, 2024 |url-access=subscription |archive-date=March 6, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240306100548/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-06/nvidia-ai-stocks-are-latest-trend-to-send-s-p-500-to-new-highs |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum.

Those omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the SEC emphasized.
