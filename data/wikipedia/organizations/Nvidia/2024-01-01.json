Running at 120&nbsp;MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.\n\nDue to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance.
