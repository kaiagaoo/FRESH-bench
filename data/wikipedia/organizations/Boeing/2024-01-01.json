There are five main concepts the team is reviewing. SUGAR-Free and Refined SUGAR, are two concepts based on conventional aircraft similar to the 737. SUGAR High and SUGAR Volt, are both high-span, strut-based wing concepts. The final concept is SUGAR Ray, which is a wing-body hybrid. The SUGAR Volt concept has resulted in a drop in fuel burn by more than 70 percent and a reduction of total energy use by 55 %. This reduction is the result of adding an electric battery gas turbine hybrid propulsion system.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/Features/2010/06/corp_envision_06_14_10.html
