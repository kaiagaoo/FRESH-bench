This includes text, images, tables, and even pages themselves. This allows users to easily customize a page by adding and moving blocks in various ways. In June 2021, Notion released a 'synced block', which is a special type of block that, when copied and pasted across different pages in a user's workspace, will shows edits synchronously.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Frank |first=Thomas |date=2021-05-10 |title=Notion Blocks: Everything You Need to Know |url=https://thomasjfrank.com/notion-blocks-guide/ |access-date=2023-05-02 |website=Thomas Frank |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Databases ===\nOne of Notion's most notable features is its database. Databases are used for storing information and can hold any number of rows and columns. By default, each row will have two pre-populated properties: 'Name' and 'Tags'. Users can add more properties, such as date, checkbox, multi-select, URL, and more. When creating databases, users can choose to either create it 'inline', within an already existing page, or as its own page.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Los |first=Sija |date=2022-12-09 |title=The Only Tutorial You'll Need to Get Your Notion Up and Running |url=https://medium.com/@Ramblingsofa20something/the-only-tutorial-youll-need-to-get-your-notion-up-and-running-1837657bbc5d |access-date=2023-05-02 |website=Medium |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Templates ===\nAnother popular feature that Notion provides is the ability for users to make templates and share them with others. Notion hosts its very own template gallery, where users can browse through templates made by other Notion creators. However, not all of these templates are free to use. Some creators have also made a profit from selling Notion templates. Jason Ruiyi Chen, a 20-year-old from Singapore, made $239,000 by selling his Notion templates to his Twitter audience. Thomas Frank, a YouTuber with 2.8 million subscribers as of February 2023, earned more than $1 million in 2022. <ref>{{Cite web |title=The YouTuber Making $1 Million Selling Notion 'Templates' |url=https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-youtuber-making-1-million-selling-notion-templates |access-date=2023-05-02 |website=The Information}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Courter |first=Emily |title=I made $239,000 this year selling budgeting and productivity templates online.

It will also work with other datasets in response to an input by the user of the AI. This AI can automate complex tasks, write in a better way, also assist the user to make a brief or outline from a single line of an idea. Notion AI has its own subscription set which is '''$10/month/person.'''<ref>{{Cite web |title=Notion AI |url=https://www.notion.so/product/ai |access-date=2023-05-28 |website=Notion |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Using Notion AI to extend your impact |url=https://www.notion.so/help/guides/using-notion-ai |access-date=2023-05-28 |website=Notion |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n== Pricing ==\nNotion has a four-tiered [[Subscription business model|subscription]] model: Free, Plus, Business and Enterprise.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.notion.so/pricing|title=Notion Pricing Plans}}</ref> Users can also earn credit via [[Referral marketing|referrals]].
