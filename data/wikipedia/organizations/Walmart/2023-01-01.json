These workers experienced harsh living conditions in tightly packed trailers outside of the work facility, physical threats, verbal abuse, and were forced to work day-long shifts. Many of the workers were afraid to take action about the abuse due to the fact that the manager threatened the lives of their family members in the U.S. and Mexico if the abuse were to be reported. Eight of the workers confronted management at CJ's Seafood about the mistreatment; however, the management denied the abuse allegations and the workers went on strike. The workers then took their stories to Walmart due to their partnership with CJ's. While Walmart was investigating the situation, the workers collected 150,000 signatures of supporters who agreed that Walmart should stand by the workers and take action. In June 2012, the visa workers held a protest and day-long hunger strike outside of the apartment building where a Walmart board member resided. Following this protest, Walmart announced its final decision to no longer work with CJ's Seafood. Less than a month later, the Department of Labor fined CJ's Seafood \"approximately $460,000 in back-pay, safety violations, wage and hour violations, civil damages, and fines for abuses to the H-2B program. The company has since shut down.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/mexican-guest-workers-gain-walmart-federal-response-louisiana-usa-2012 |title = Mexican guest workers gain Walmart, federal response, Louisiana, USA, 2012 |last = Capron |first = Christopher |date = November 11, 2012 |website = Global Nonviolent Action Database |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170929000345/https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/mexican-guest-workers-gain-walmart-federal-response-louisiana-usa-2012 |archive-date = September 29, 2017 |url-status=live |access-date = September 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2012|December|df=US|post=,}} internal investigations were ongoing into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.<ref name=\"NYT121712\">{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/business/walmart-bribes-teotihuacan.html |title = The Bribery Aisle: How Wal-Mart Got Its Way in Mexico |work = The New York Times |date = December 17, 2012 |access-date = April 29, 2013 |author1 = Barstow, David |author2 = von Bertrab, Alejandra Xanic |author-link1 = David Barstow |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130322234030/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/business/walmart-bribes-teotihuacan.html |archive-date = March 22, 2013}}</ref> Walmart has invested {{US$|99&nbsp;million}} on internal investigations, which expanded beyond Mexico to implicate operations in China, Brazil, and India.<ref name=\"Clifford 12\">{{cite news |title = Wal-Mart inquiry reflects alarm on corruption |last1 = Clifford |first1 = Stephanie |last2 = Barnstow |first2 = David |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/business/wal-mart-expands-foreign-bribery-investigation.html |newspaper = The New York Times |date = November 15, 2012 |access-date = February 28, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150925051846/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/business/wal-mart-expands-foreign-bribery-investigation.html |archive-date = September 25, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Brown 12\">{{cite news |title = Wal-Mart bribery probe expands past Mexico to Brazil, China and India |last1 = Brown |first1 = Abram |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2012/11/15/probe-into-wal-mart-bribery-past-mexico-to-brazil-china-and-india/ |magazine = Forbes |date = November 15, 2012 |access-date = February 28, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132316/http://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2012/11/15/probe-into-wal-mart-bribery-past-mexico-to-brazil-china-and-india/#6973d1417561 |archive-date = March 4, 2016}}</ref> The case has added fuel to the debate as to whether foreign investment will result in increased prosperity, or if it merely allows local retail trade and economic policy to be taken over by \"foreign financial and corporate interests\".<ref name=\"Sharma 12\">{{cite news |title = India government agency probes Wal-Mart investments |last1 = Sharma |first1 = Malavika |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-05/india-government-agency-probes-wal-mart-investments |magazine = Bloomberg |date = December 5, 2012 |access-date = February 28, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160314064550/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-05/india-government-agency-probes-wal-mart-investments |archive-date = March 14, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTIndia\">{{cite news |last1 = Thirani |first1 = Neha |last2 = Kumar |first2 = Hari |title = Fact-Checking the F.D.I.

Competitors of Walmart's Sam's Club division are [[Costco]] and the smaller [[BJ's Wholesale Club]] chain. Walmart's move into the grocery business in the late 1990s set it against major supermarket chains in both the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"Stilgoe\"/>  Studies have typically found that Walmart's prices are significantly lower than those of their competitors, and that Walmart's presence is associated with lower food prices for households. Comparisons of performance metrics such as sales per square foot suggest that supermarkets in direct competition with Walmart Supercenters show significant decreases in profit margins, an effect that is strongest in the case of unionized competitors. Between 2000 and 2010, Walmart's entry into new areas often lowered local food prices at other stores.

Presumably, people who previously shopped in towns without Wal-Mart stores  choose to shop in towns with Wal-Mart stores, part of an older pattern in which smaller centers lose retail sales to larger ones. Stone compared the changes to previous competitors that small town shops have faced in the past, such as the development of the railroads, the Sears Roebuck catalog, and shopping malls. He concluded that small towns are more affected by \"discount mass merchandiser stores\" than larger towns and that shop owners who adapt to the ever-changing retail market can \"co-exist and even thrive in this type of environment.\"<ref name=\"Rural\"/> In later research Artz and Stone (2006) reported that in MIssissippi the impact of opening a Walmart was much larger on existing retailers in rural communities (17%) than more urban ones (4%).<ref name=\"Volpe\"/><ref name=\"Artz\">{{cite journal |last1=Artz |first1=Georgeanne M. |last2=Stone |first2=Kenneth E. |title=Analyzing the Impact of Wal-Mart Supercenters on Local Food Store Sales |journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics |date=2006 |volume=88 |issue=5 |pages=1296\u20131303 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8276.2006.00948.x |jstor=4123607 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4123607 |access-date=14 October 2022 |issn=0002-9092}}</ref> This also suggests that Walmart has achieved its strongest growth in non-metropolitan areas, which tend to be low-income.<ref name=\"Volpe\"/>\n\nStudies of the impact of Walmart tend to focus on Supercenters rather than Neighborhood Markets.

Research so far suggests that Walmart superstores have little effect on smaller retailers such as \"Mom and Pop\" businesses.<ref name=\"Volpe\"/>  A 2008 economic analysis published in the journal ''[[Economic Inquiry]]'' suggested that \"the process of [[creative destruction]] unleashed by Wal\u2010Mart has had no statistically significant long\u2010run impact on the overall size and profitability of the small business sector in the United States.\"<ref name=\"sobel_dean\">{{Cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1465-7295.2007.00091.x|doi = 10.1111/j.1465-7295.2007.00091.x|title = Has Wal-Mart Buried Mom and Pop?: The Impact of Wal-Mart on Self-Employment and Small Establishments in the United States|year = 2008|last1 = Sobel|first1 = Russell S.|last2 = Dean|first2 = Andrea M.|journal = Economic Inquiry|volume = 46|issue = 4|pages = 676\u2013695|s2cid = 28554345}}</ref>\n\nImpact appears to be related to a number of factors, with a key factor being the goods offered for sale.<ref name=\"Volpe\"/> A study by Ailawadi and others (2010) examined the impact of new Walmarts in detail.  She reported that median sales dropped 40 percent at similar high-volume stores, 17 percent at supermarkets and 6 percent at drugstores. However, 30 percent of specific product categories at high-volume stores were unaffected. Many retailers reduced prices and cut product selection in an attempt to compete directly with Walmart, in effect attacking its areas  of strength. A more successful approach was to track sales, identify vulnerable categories, and increase the range of products in those categories. By including products at both top and bottom price points, and offering temporary promotions on those items, retailers could attract both customers who were price-conscious and those interested in a wider range of options. A small store that specialized in a particular product area could compete effectively against Walmart.<ref name=\"Tuck\">{{cite news |title=Think Outside of the Box (Store): Defending Against Walmart |url=https://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/news/articles/think-outside-of-the-box-store-defending-against-walmart |access-date=14 October 2022 |work=Tuck Forum |publisher=Dartmouth University |date=November 2009 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Ailawadi\">{{cite journal |last1=Ailawadi |first1=Kusum L. |last2=Zhang |first2=Jie |last3=Krishna |first3=Aradhna |last4=Kruger |first4=Michael W. |title=When Wal-Mart Enters: How Incumbent Retailers React and how this Affects their Sales Outcomes |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |date=August 2010 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=577\u2013593 |doi=10.1509/jmkr.47.4.577 |s2cid=21105799 |url=https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/sage/when-wal-mart-enters-how-incumbent-retailers-react-and-how-this-258YW2pwLT?key=sage |access-date=14 October 2022 |language=en |issn=0022-2437}}</ref> Small specialized stores are less effective against big-box [[category killer]] chains such as [[Home Depot]] and [[Best Buy]] electronics.<ref name=\"Crowley\">{{cite journal |last1=Crowley |first1=Martha |last2=Stainback |first2=Kevin |title=Retail Sector Concentration, Local Economic Structure, and Community Well-Being |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |date=30 July 2019 |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=321\u2013343 |doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-073018-022449 |s2cid=181369011 |url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-073018-022449 |access-date=17 October 2022 |language=en |issn=0360-0572}}</ref>\n\nSome studies have suggested that the impact a Walmart store has on a local business is correlated to its distance from the store.

Large externally-oriented businesses tend to be associated with lower local standards of living, greater inequality, and less social and civic participation.  In contrast, locally oriented businesses are associated with higher rates of church membership, community engagement, civic improvement and recreation. They may also be associated with higher rates of home-ownership and expenditures on health and public schools.
