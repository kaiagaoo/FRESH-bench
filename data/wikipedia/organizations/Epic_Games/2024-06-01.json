The company was founded by [[Tim Sweeney (game developer)|Tim Sweeney]] as '''Potomac Computer Systems''' in 1991, originally located in his parents' house in [[Potomac, Maryland]]. Following its first commercial video game release, ''[[ZZT]]'' (1991), the company became '''Epic MegaGames, Inc.''' in early 1992 and brought on [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], who has been its [[vice president]] since. After moving the headquarters to Cary in 1999, the studio changed its name to Epic Games.\n\nEpic Games developed [[Unreal Engine]], a commercially available [[game engine]] which also powers its internally developed video games like ''[[Fortnite]]'' and the ''[[Unreal (video game series)|Unreal]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'', and ''[[Infinity Blade]]'' series. In 2014, Unreal Engine was named the \"most successful videogame engine\" by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.<ref name=\"guinness\">{{cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-game-engine |title=Most successful videogame engine |website=[[Guinness World Records]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151655/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-game-engine |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEpic Games owns the game developers  [[Psyonix]], [[Mediatonic]], and [[Harmonix]], and operates studios in multiple locations around the world. While Sweeney remains the controlling shareholder, [[Tencent]] acquired a 48.4% outstanding stake, equating to 40% of total Epic, in the company in 2012, as part of an agreement aimed at moving Epic towards a [[games as a service]] model. Following the release of the popular ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' in 2017, the company gained additional investments that enabled it to expand its Unreal Engine offerings, establish [[esports]] events around ''Fortnite'', and launch the [[Epic Games Store]]. As of April 2022, the company has a {{USD|32 billion}} equity valuation.\n\nOn August 13, 2020, Epic released a version of ''Fortnite'' that included a permanent discount on V-bucks across all platforms (except iOS and Android devices) if they purchased directly through Epic, bypassing Apple and Google's storefronts. Both [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]] immediately delisted the game for violating the storefronts' terms of service by including their own storefront, which led Epic to [[Epic Games v. Apple|file lawsuits against both companies]] the same day, accusing them of antitrust behavior in how they operate their app stores. While Apple was ultimately victorious in a bench trial in September 2021 and upheld through appeals, Google's actions were found to be monopolistic by a jury trial in December 2023.\n\n== History ==\n=== Potomac Computer Systems (1991\u20131992) ===\nPotomac Computer Systems was founded by [[Tim Sweeney (game developer)|Tim Sweeney]] in 1991.<ref name=\"gamasutra\">{{cite web |url=https://gamasutra.com/view/feature/132426/from_the_past_to_the_future_tim_.php |title=From The Past To The Future: Tim Sweeney Talks |last=Edwards |first=Benj |date=May 25, 2009 |website=[[Gamasutra]] |access-date=June 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204115638/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132426/from_the_past_to_the_future_tim_.php |archive-date=February 4, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> At the time, Sweeney was studying [[mechanical engineering]] and living in a dorm at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]].
