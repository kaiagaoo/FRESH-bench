With aid from his first employee (with whom he worked in marketing at Apple), Rich Melmon, the original plan was written, mostly by Hawkins, on an [[Apple II]] in Sequoia Capital's office in August 1982. During that time, Hawkins also employed two of his former staff from Apple, Dave Evans and Pat Marriott, as [[game producer|producers]], and a Stanford MBA classmate, Jeff Burton from Atari for international business development. The business plan was again refined in September and reissued on October 8, 1982. By November, the employee headcount rose to 11, including Tim Mott, [[Bing Gordon]], David Maynard, and Steve Hayes.<ref name=\"Gamespy\" /><ref name=\"gamasutra history\">{{cite web |last=Fleming |first=Jeffrey |url=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/we-see-farther---a-history-of-electronic-arts |title=We See Farther \u2013 A History of Electronic Arts |website=Game Developer |date=February 12, 2007 |access-date=February 25, 2022|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075442/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130129/we_see_farther__a_history_of_.php?print=1 |archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> Having outgrown the office space provided by Sequoia Capital, the company relocated to a [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]] office that overlooked the [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco Airport]] landing path.\n\nWhen he incorporated the company, Hawkins originally chose Amazin' Software as their company name, but his other early employees of the company universally disliked the name; as a result, the company changed its name to Electronic Arts in November 1982.<ref name=\"Gamespy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/697/697083p5.html |title=GameSpy Retro: Developer Origins, Page 5 of 19 |first=John |last=Keefer |date=March 31, 2006 |website=[[GameSpy]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609133038/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/697/697083p5.html |archive-date=June 9, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He scheduled an off-site meeting in the [[Pajaro, California|Pajaro Dunes]], where the company once held such off-site meetings.<ref>{{cite news |title=Graduation Day for Computer Entertainment |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |date=July 1993 |issue=108 |page=34}}</ref> Hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers \"software artists\". Hence, the latest version of the business plan suggested the name \"SoftArt\". Hawkins and Melmon knew the founders of [[Software Arts]], the creators of [[VisiCalc]], and thought their permission should be obtained. [[Dan Bricklin]] did not want the name used because it sounded too similar (perhaps \"[[confusingly similar]]\") to ''Software Arts''; however, the name concept was liked by all the attendees. Hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio [[United Artists]] and liked the reputation that the company had created. Hawkins said everyone had a vote, but they would lose it if they went to sleep.<ref name=\"ea-early-history\">{{cite book |title=High Score!

When Gordon and others pushed for \"Electronic Artists\", in tribute to the film company [[United Artists]], Steve Hayes opposed, saying, \"We're not the artists, they [the developers] are...\" This statement from Hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards Electronic Arts and the name was unanimously endorsed and adopted later in 1982.<ref name=\"ea-early-history\" /> He recruited his original employees from Apple, Atari, Xerox PARC, and VisiCorp, and got [[Steve Wozniak]] to agree to sit on the board of directors.<ref>[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]] By [[Steven Levy]], page 335</ref> Hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers. Combined with the fact that Hawkins was pioneering new game brands, this made sales growth more challenging. Retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners. Former CEO [[Larry Probst]] arrived as VP of Sales in late 1984 and helped expand the already successful company. This policy of dealing directly with retailers gave EA higher margins and better market awareness, key advantages the company leveraged to leapfrog its early competitors.<ref name=\"gamasutra history\" /><ref name=\"NGen11\" />\n\nPromoting its developers was a trademark of EA's early days.

A drawing program ''[[Deluxe Paint]]'' (1985) and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for Amiga platform.

In 1987, EA released ''[[Skate or Die!]]'', their first internally developed game. EA continued publishing their external developers' games while experimenting with their internal development strategy. This led to EA's decision of purchasing out a series of companies they identify as successful, as well as the decision to release annualized franchises to cut budget costs. Because of Trip Hawkins' obsession of simulating a sports game, he signed a contract with football coach [[John Madden]] that led to EA's developing and releasing annual ''[[Madden NFL]]'' games.<ref name=\"ea-polygon\">{{cite news |url=https://www.polygon.com/a/how-ea-lost-its-soul/ |title=How Electronic Arts Lost Its Soul |last=Campbell |first=Colin |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |issue=8 |date=July 14, 2015 |access-date=February 21, 2019 |archive-date=February 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222042138/https://www.polygon.com/a/how-ea-lost-its-soul/ |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|8}}<ref name=\"ea-polygon\" />{{rp|10}}\n\nIn 1988, EA published a flight simulator game exclusively for Amiga, ''[[F/A-18 Interceptor]]'', with filled-polygon graphics that were advanced for the time.<ref>{{cite news |title=[[Software Reviews on File]] |publisher=[[Facts on File]] |issue=6 |page=103 |date=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Game Developer's Marketplace |last1=Sawyer |first1=Ben |last2=Dunne |first2=Alex |last3=Berg |first3=Tor |publisher=Coriolis Group Books |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781576101773/page/182 182] |date=1998 |isbn=978-1576101773 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781576101773/page/182 }}</ref> Another significant Amiga release (also initially available for Atari ST, later converted for other platforms) was ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'' (1989) developed by [[Bullfrog Productions]].

In October 1993, 3DO developed the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]], which at the time was the most powerful game console. Once a critic of game consoles, Hawkins had conceived a console that unlike its competitors would not require a first-party license to be marketed, and was intended to appeal to the PC market. Electronic Arts was The 3DO Company's primary partner in sponsoring their console, showcasing on it their latest games. With a retail price of US$700 ({{inflation|US|700|1993|fmt=eq|r=2}}) compared to its competitors' $100, the console lagged in sales, and with the 1995 arrival to North America of Sony's [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], a cheaper and more powerful alternative, combined with a lower quality of the 3DO's software library as a [[unintended consequences|backfiring]] of its liberal license policy, it fell further behind and lost competition. Electronic Arts dropped its support for 3DO in favor of the PlayStation, 3DO's production ceased in 1996 and, for the remainder of the company's lifetime, 3DO developed video games for other consoles and the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] until it folded in 2003.<ref name=\"gamasutra history\" /><ref name=\"ea-early-history\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=EA: Celebrating 25 Years of Interactive Entertainment |last=Funk |first=Joe |publisher=[[Prima Games]] |date=2007 |isbn=978-0761558392}}</ref>{{rp|79}}<ref name=\"hawkins-bio\" />{{rp|283}}<ref name=\"hawkins-bio\" />{{rp|646}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.engadget.com/2005/12/09/industry-bio-trip-hawkins/ |title=Industry Bio: Trip Hawkins |work=[[Joystiq]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |volume=1 |date=December 9, 2005 |access-date=February 16, 2019 |archive-date=June 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616204206/https://www.engadget.com/2005/12/09/industry-bio-trip-hawkins/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Electronicartsheadquarters.jpg|thumb|250px|EA headquarters in October 2007]]\nIn 1994, Electronic Arts and [[THQ]] signed a licensing agreement to develop and release EA's titles, like ''[[Madden NFL|John Madden Football]]'', ''[[FIFA International Soccer]]'', ''[[Shaq Fu]]'', ''[[Jungle Strike]]'' and [[Urban Strike]] for various consoles.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=June 1994 |title=ProNews |pages=186 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/b/bf/GamePro_US_059.pdf |access-date=September 20, 2023 |archive-date=March 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308054830/https://retrocdn.net/images/b/bf/GamePro_US_059.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1995, Electronic Arts won the [[European Computer Trade Show]] award for best software publisher of the year.<ref>{{cite journal |title=PlayStation Dominates European Show |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=6 |date=June 1995 |page=15}}</ref> As the company was still expanding, they opted to purchase space in [[Redwood Shores, California]] in 1995 for construction of a new headquarters,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/EA-Plans-To-Leave-San-Mateo-Game-company-moving-3044369.php |title=EA Plans To Leave San Mateo / Game company moving to Redwood Shores |first=Mark |last=Simon |date=February 23, 1995 |access-date=October 19, 2017 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |archive-date=October 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020140747/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/EA-Plans-To-Leave-San-Mateo-Game-company-moving-3044369.php |url-status=live }}</ref> which was completed in 1998.<ref name=\"gamasutra history\" /> Early in 1997, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' identified Electronic Arts as the only company to regularly profit from video games over the past five years, and noted it had \"a critical track record second to none\".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=So Who's Getting Rich? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=30 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1997 |page=43 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n44}}</ref> In 1999, EA replaced their long-running Shapes logo with one based on the EA Sports logo used at the time.

A similar breakthrough was reached with signing on [[Harmonix]] for the distribution of the ''[[Rock Band]]'' games, requiring them to work closely with [[MTV Games]] on the plastic instrument controllers necessary for the titles.<ref name=\"gi history ea partners\"/> A number of major partnerships were made over the next few years, including [[Namco Bandai]], [[Crytek]], [[Starbreeze Studios]], [[id Software]], [[Epic Games]] and [[People Can Fly]], [[Double Fine Productions]], [[Grasshopper Manufacture]], [[Spicy Horse]], and [[Realtime Worlds]].<ref name=\"gi history ea partners\"/> While many of these partnerships proved successful, the division had two major marks on its name. It was associated with the situation around ''[[Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning]]'' developed by [[38 Studios]], which had been significantly backed by loans from taxpayer funds from the state of [[Rhode Island]]. ''Kingdoms'' failed to be commercially successful, and EA Partners pulled out of making a sequel, leaving 38 Studios in default of its loan payback to the state. Secondly, while ''[[The Secret World]]'' from [[Funcom]] launched as a subscription game, Funcom had to switch their monetization model to free-to-play to improve their revenues, which further affected EA Partners.{{better source needed|date=October 2021}}<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-25-ea-partners-publisher-of-portal-2-left-4-dead-crysis-and-more-is-shutting-down | title = EA Partners, publisher of Portal 2, Left 4 Dead, Crysis and more, is shutting down | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole | date = April 25, 2013 | access-date = March 25, 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] | archive-date = March 25, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190325212528/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-25-ea-partners-publisher-of-portal-2-left-4-dead-crysis-and-more-is-shutting-down | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nAround April 2013, as part of a large 1000-employee layoff, many reporters claimed that EA Partners was also being shut down for its poor commercial performance,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/gaming/2013/4/25/4266216/ea-announces-more-layoffs-partner-program-shutdown-rumored | title = Electronic Arts layoffs and studio closures pile up, EA Partners could be on the chopping block | first = Adi | last = Robertson | date = April 23, 2013 | access-date = March 25, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] | archive-date = March 27, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190327090755/https://www.theverge.com/gaming/2013/4/25/4266216/ea-announces-more-layoffs-partner-program-shutdown-rumored | url-status = live }}</ref> but the program remained active as the company refocused its efforts.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/9/4412194/ea-partners-isnt-dead-says-exec | title = EA Partners isn't dead, says exec | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = June 9, 2013 | access-date = March 25, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-date = April 6, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190406065404/https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/9/4412194/ea-partners-isnt-dead-says-exec | url-status = live }}</ref> The label remained dormant over the next several years, while Letts expanded on the EA Originals program, but following the move of EA Partners and EA Origins into the Strategic Growth group in August 2018,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/ea-chief-design-officer-patrick-soderlund-leaves-company-1202904465/ | title = EA Chief Design Officer Patrick Soderlund Leaves Company | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = August 14, 2018 | access-date = March 25, 2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | archive-date = November 3, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181103170537/https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/ea-chief-design-officer-patrick-soderlund-leaves-company-1202904465/ | url-status = live }}</ref> the label was revived on the March 2019 with a publishing deal with Velan Studios, formed from the former heads of Vicarious Visions.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ea-inks-publishing-deal-new-game-studio-vicarious-visions-founders-1196825 |title=EA Partners will publish the first game from Karthik and Guha Bala's newly formed Velan Studios |first=Patrick |last=Shanley |date=March 25, 2019 |access-date=March 25, 2019 |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |archive-date=April 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404032346/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ea-inks-publishing-deal-new-game-studio-vicarious-visions-founders-1196825 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nNotable publishing/distribution agreements include:\n* ''[[Alice: Madness Returns]]'' \u2013 [[Spicy Horse]]\n* ''[[APB: All Points Bulletin|APB]]'' \u2013 [[Realtime Worlds]]\n* ''[[Br\u00fctal Legend]]'' \u2013 [[Double Fine Productions]]\n* ''[[Bulletstorm]]'' \u2013 [[Epic Games]]\n* ''[[Crysis]]'' series \u2013 [[Crytek]]\n* ''[[DeathSpank]]'' \u2013 [[Hothead Games]]\n* ''[[Fuse (video game)|Fuse]]'' \u2013 [[Insomniac Games]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/39141/EA-Partners-signs-new-Insomniac-game |title=EA Partners signs new Insomniac game &#124;
