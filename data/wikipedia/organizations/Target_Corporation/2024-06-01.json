Also, managers are known as \"Executive Team Leaders (ETLs)\", \"Senior Team Leaders (SRTLs)\", or \"Service and Engagement Team Leaders (SETLs)\", and the Store Manager is known as the \"Store Team Leader (STL)\", Further up the \"chain of command\" are \"District Team Leaders (DTL)\", \"Group Team Leaders (GTL, sometimes also Group Vice President)\", \"Regional Team Leaders (RTL, sometimes also Regional Vice President)\", and corporate-level executives.\n\nThis practice began to be revised in 2018 and became more widespread in 2019 as the Group Team Leader became the Group Operations Director. District Team Leader became the District Senior Director. The Store Team Leader became Store Director. Executive Team Leaders were shortened to Executive Team Lead. Other Team Leaders retained their title though some of the department names changed such as Guest Service Team Leader was renamed Service & Engagement Team Leader. Front of store team members was renamed Guest Advocates. Specialty areas in Style, Beauty and Tech are considered Consultants. Other areas such as General Merchandise, Presentation, Inbound, Fulfillment, Food Service and Reverse Logistics are considered Experts, and [[Retail loss prevention|Assets Protection]] and Security Officers are Specialists. Distribution centers and the supply chain including corporate office refers to its employees as Team members, Operations manager, Senior operations manager, Distribution Director, Problem Solvers, and Leads.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Target-Distribution-Operations-Manager-Salaries-E194_D_KO7,38.htm |title=Target Distribution Operations Manager Salaries |publisher=Glassdoor |date=December 13, 2021 |accessdate=February 21, 2022 |archive-date=January 20, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220120234441/https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Target-Distribution-Operations-Manager-Salaries-E194_D_KO7,38.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Product lines and partnerships===\nTarget has many exclusive deals with various designers and name brands, including Finnish design company [[Marimekko]]; architect [[Michael Graves]]; athletic wear company [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]; Portland-based undergarment designer Pair of Thieves; Italian fashion label [[Fiorucci]]; fashion designers [[Lilly Pulitzer]], [[Liz Lange]], [[Mossimo|Mossimo Giannulli]], and [[Isaac Mizrahi]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|last=Xie|first=Jenny|date=September 9, 2019|title=Our wishlist for Target's 20th Anniversary Collection of designer collabs|url=https://www.curbed.com/2019/9/9/20851105/target-20th-anniversary-collection-designers-home-goods|access-date=July 31, 2020|website=Curbed|language=en|archive-date=August 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808034153/https://www.curbed.com/2019/9/9/20851105/target-20th-anniversary-collection-designers-home-goods|url-status=live}}</ref> To further increase its fashion profile, Target also created its fashion-forward [[Go International]] line, which hires famous designers to design collections available only for a few months.<ref name=michael_graves>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_1999_Feb_8/ai_53904958 Is Target making a Graves mistake?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312085505/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_1999_Feb_8/ai_53904958 |date=March 12, 2007 }}, ''Discount Store News'', February 8, 1999.</ref>\n\nAfter hiring architect Michael Graves to design the scaffolding used to renovate the [[Washington Monument]] and contributing US$6&nbsp;million to the restoration plan, Target introduced its first designer line of products in 1999, the Michael Graves Collection of housewares and home decor products.<ref name=\"michael_graves\"/> [[Walmart]] and [[Kmart (United States)|Kmart]] have followed Target's lead by signing exclusive designers to their stores as well.<ref>{{cite web|date=March 19, 2012|title=Walmart, Target, Kmart, Kohl's Lead 50 Years of Retail Revolution|url=https://adage.com/article/news/walmart-target-kmart-kohl-s-lead-retail-revolution/233379|access-date=July 31, 2020|website=adage.com|language=en|archive-date=July 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726231452/https://adage.com/article/news/walmart-target-kmart-kohl-s-lead-retail-revolution/233379|url-status=live}}</ref> Target also partners with well-established national brands to create exclusive collections for its stores.<ref name=\"michael_graves\"/>\n\nIn 2005, Target introduced a major revision of [[prescription drug|prescription]] bottles, which it calls the [[ClearRx]] system.
