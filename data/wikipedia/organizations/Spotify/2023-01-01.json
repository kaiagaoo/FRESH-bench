Audio files must either be in the .mp3, .mp4 (.mp4 files that have video streams are not supported), or .m4p media formats. This feature is available only for Premium subscribers.\n\nSpotify has a median playback latency of 265 ms (including local [[cache (computing)|cache]]).<ref>{{cite web |first1=Gunnar |last1=Kreitz |first2=Fredrik |last2=Niemel\u00e4 |title=Spotify \u2013 Large Scale, Low Latency, P2P Music-on-Demand Streaming |url=http://www.csc.kth.se/~gkreitz/spotify-p2p10/spotify-p2p10.pdf |publisher=[[Royal Institute of Technology]] |access-date=9 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, Spotify moved away from the [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) system they had used to distribute music to users. Previously, a desktop user would listen to music from one of three sources: a cached file on the computer, one of Spotify's servers, or from other subscribers through the P2P system. P2P, a well-established Internet distribution system, served as an alternative that reduced Spotify's server resources and costs. However, Spotify ended the P2P setup in 2014, with Spotify's Alison Bonny telling [[TorrentFreak]]: \"We're gradually phasing out the use of our desktop P2P technology which has helped our users enjoy their music both speedily and seamlessly. We're now at a stage where we can power music delivery through our growing number of servers and ensure our users continue to receive a best-in-class service.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=Ernesto |title=Spotify Starts Shutting Down Its Massive P2P Network |url=https://torrentfreak.com/spotify-starts-shutting-down-its-massive-p2p-network-140416/ |publisher=[[TorrentFreak]] |date=16 April 2014 |access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nOriginally Spotify had their own servers but in 2016 most of their infrastructure was migrated to [[Google Cloud Platform|Google cloud]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Toor |first=Amar |date=2016-02-24 |title=Spotify is moving its data to Google's servers |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/24/11104446/spotify-google-cloud-platform |access-date=2022-07-06 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Car Thing ===\nSpotify first announced a voice-activated music-streaming gadget for cars in May 2019.
