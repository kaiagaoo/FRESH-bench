Women's apparel can roughly be divided into petite, straight, and plus sizes, leaving gaps in between. Realistic videos about how differently pieces of garment fit on a model compared to how they fit on a typical consumer resonated with many who had believed that they were alone in their struggle.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paton|first=Elizabeth|title=The Mean Life of a 'Midsize' Model|date=4 February 2023|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/fashion/plus-size-models-weight.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=2 July 2023|archive-date=12 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230512063904/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/fashion/plus-size-models-weight.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Allaire|first=Christian|title=This Curve Model Does Realistic Clothing Hauls on TikTok|date=21 February 2021|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/remi-bader-curve-model-tiktok-star|website=Vogue|access-date=2 July 2023|archive-date=2 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230702064335/https://www.vogue.com/article/remi-bader-curve-model-tiktok-star|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dube|first=Rachel|title=What is mid-size fashion?

In December 2021, ''[[Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery]]'', the journal of the [[American Society of Plastic Surgeons]], published an article about the popularity of some plastic surgeons on TikTok. In the article, it was noted that plastic surgeons were some of the earliest adopters of social media in the medical field and many had been recognized as [[influencers]] on the platform. The article published stats about the most popular plastic surgeons on TikTok up to February 2021 and at the time, five different plastic surgeons had surpassed 1 million followers on the platform.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Rishub K. |last2=Drolet |first2=Brian C. |title=Plastic Surgeons in TikTok: Top Influencers, Most Recent Posts, and User Engagement |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |date=December 2021 |volume=148 |issue=6 |pages=1094e\u20131097e |doi=10.1097/PRS.0000000000008566 |pmid=34705755 |s2cid=240074110 |url=https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/fulltext/2021/12000/plastic_surgeons_in_tiktok__top_influencers,_most.86.aspx |issn=0032-1052 |doi-access=free |access-date=27 February 2023 |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326030849/https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/fulltext/2021/12000/plastic_surgeons_in_tiktok__top_influencers,_most.86.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bushak |first1=Lecia |title=TikTok's most popular plastic surgeon influencers |url=https://www.mmm-online.com/home/channel/tiktoks-most-popular-plastic-surgeon-influencers/ |website=MM+M |publisher=Medical Marketing and Media |access-date=27 February 2023 |date=11 November 2022 |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326030917/https://www.mmm-online.com/home/channel/tiktoks-most-popular-plastic-surgeon-influencers/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2021, it was reported that a trend known as the #NoseJobCheck trend was going viral on TikTok. TikTok content creators used a specific audio on their videos while showing how their noses looked before and after having their [[rhinoplasty]] surgeries. By January 2021, the hashtag #nosejob had accumulated 1.6 billion views, #nosejobcheck had accumulated 1 billion views, and the audio used in the #NoseJobCheck trend had been used in 120,000 videos.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zitser |first=Joshua |date=10 January 2021 |title=Insider created a TikTok account and set the age at 14 to test how long before a plastic surgeon's promotional video appeared.

They also reported that facilities that offered these surgeries were also posting about them on TikTok. TikTok has banned the advertising of cosmetic surgeries on the platform but cosmetic surgeons are still able to reach large audiences using unpaid photo and video posts. NBC reported that videos using the hashtags '#plasticsurgery' and '#lipfiller' had amassed a combined 26 billion views on the platform.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tenbarge |first1=Kat |date=27 April 2022 |title=Young influencers are being offered cheap procedures in return for promotion.

The practice began as a way to grow and diversify content and [[influencers]] that were not automatically picked up by the recommendation algorithm. It was also used to promote brands, artists, and NGOs, such as the [[FIFA World Cup]] and Taylor Swift.<ref>{{cite news|last=Main|first=Nikki|title=TikTok Overrode Its Algorithm to Boost the World Cup and Taylor Swift|date=13 March 2023|publisher=Gizmodo|url=https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-world-cup-taylor-swift-sxsw-bytedance-1850221178|access-date=13 July 2023|archive-date=13 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713073517/https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-world-cup-taylor-swift-sxsw-bytedance-1850221178|url-status=live}}</ref> However, some employees have abused it to promote their own accounts or those of their spouses, while others have felt that their guidelines leave too much room for discretion. TikTok said only a few individuals can approve heating in the U.S. and the promoted videos take up less than 0.002% of user feeds. To address concerns of Chinese influence, the company is negotiating with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) such that future heating could only be performed by vetted security personnel in the U.S. and the process would be audited by third-parties such as Oracle.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2023/01/20/tiktoks-secret-heating-button-can-make-anyone-go-viral/?sh=ef10e3d6bfd4 |magazine=[[Forbes]] |first=Emily |last=Baker-White |date=20 January 2023 |title=TikTok's Secret 'Heating' Button Can Make Anyone Go Viral |access-date=21 April 2023 |archive-date=21 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230421004436/https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2023/01/20/tiktoks-secret-heating-button-can-make-anyone-go-viral/?sh=ef10e3d6bfd4 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Censorship and moderation ===\n{{Main article|Censorship by TikTok}}\n\nTikTok's and Douyin's censorship policies have been criticized as non-transparent. Internal guidelines against the promotion of violence, separatism, and \"demonization of countries\" could be used to prohibit content related to the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre]], [[Falun Gong]], [[human rights in Tibet]], Taiwan, Chechnya, Northern Ireland, the [[Cambodian genocide]], the [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|1998 Indonesian riots]], [[Kurdish nationalism]], ethnic conflicts between blacks and whites, or between different Islamic sects.
