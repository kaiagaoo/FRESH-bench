In the article, it was noted that plastic surgeons were some of the earliest adopters of social media in the medical field and many had been recognized as influencers on the platform.

The practice began as a way to grow and diversify content and [[influencers]] that were not automatically picked up by the recommendation algorithm.

TikTok said only a few individuals can approve heating in the U.S. and the promoted videos take up less than 0.002% of user feeds. To address concerns of Chinese influence, the company is negotiating with the [[Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States]] (CFIUS) such that future heating could only be performed by vetted security personnel in the U.S. and the process would be audited by third-parties such as [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]].<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2023/01/20/tiktoks-secret-heating-button-can-make-anyone-go-viral/?sh=ef10e3d6bfd4 |magazine=[[Forbes]] |first=Emily |last=Baker-White |date=20 January 2023 |title=TikTok's Secret 'Heating' Button Can Make Anyone Go Viral |access-date=21 April 2023 |archive-date=21 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230421004436/https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2023/01/20/tiktoks-secret-heating-button-can-make-anyone-go-viral/?sh=ef10e3d6bfd4 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Censorship and moderation ===\n{{Main article|Censorship by TikTok}}\n\nTikTok's and Douyin's censorship policies have been criticized as non-transparent.

influence, and software security. A new subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc. (USDS), was created to manage user data, software code, back-end systems, and content moderation. It would report to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), not ByteDance or TikTok, even for hiring practices. Oracle would review and spot check the data flows through USDS. It would also digitally sign software code, approve updates, and oversee content moderation and recommendation.
