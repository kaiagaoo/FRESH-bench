Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as ''Fox on Crime'' or ''Fox on Politics'', surrounded by news headlines. Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest. The flagship newscast at the time was ''The Schneider Report'', with [[Mike Schneider (news anchor)|Mike Schneider]]'s fast-paced delivery of the news. During the evening, Fox featured opinion shows: ''The O'Reilly Report'' (later ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''), ''The Crier Report'' (hosted by [[Catherine Crier]]) and ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]''. From the beginning, FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation. Graphics were designed to be colorful and gain attention; this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said, even if they could not hear the host (with on-screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker, and \"bullet points\" when a host was delivering commentary).
