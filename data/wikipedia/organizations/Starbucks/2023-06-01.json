During the early 1980s, they sold the company to [[Howard Schultz]] who \u2013 after a business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] \u2013 decided to convert the [[coffee bean]] store into a coffee shop serving [[espresso]]-based drinks. As chief executive officer from 1986 to 2000, Schultz's first tenure led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the [[West Coast of the United States]]. Schultz was succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]] who ran the company for five years and positioned Starbucks as a large player in [[fair trade]] coffee, increasing sales to US$5 billion. [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]] served as chief executive officer from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale [[earnings]] expansion. Schultz returned as CEO during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] and spent the succeeding decade growing the company's market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting the brand around [[corporate social responsibility]]. [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] succeeded Schultz as CEO in 2017. In March 2022, Starbucks announced that Schultz would return as CEO in April 2022 in an interim role.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news |last=Haddon |first=Heather |date=March 16, 2022 |title=Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to Return as Chain Faces Union Push, Rising Costs |language=en-US |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/starbucks-ceo-kevin-johnson-to-step-down-howard-schultz-to-return-in-interim-role-11647431940 |access-date=March 17, 2022 |issn=0099-9660}}</ref> Later that September, [[Laxman Narasimhan]] was appointed to succeed him in April 2023, with Schultz remaining a member of the Board of Directors.

There are also several select \"Starbucks Evenings\" locations that offer [[beer]], [[wine]], and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are sold at [[grocery stores]] in the United States and other countries. In 2010, the company began its [[Starbucks Reserve]] program for single-origin coffees and high-end coffee shops. It planned to open 1,000 Reserve coffee shops by the end of 2017.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Robinson | first=Melia | title=Starbucks is opening premium stores where you can buy coffee flights and cold-brew floats \u2014 take a look inside | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-of-starbucks-reserve-bar-what-its-like-2017-7 | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=July 29, 2017}}</ref> However, since succeeding Schultz, Johnson has scaled back the Reserve coffee shops to only six to ten shops.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jargon |first=Julie |title=Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson Reins In Predecessor's Ambitions: 'I'm Not Howard' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/starbucks-ceo-kevin-johnson-reins-in-predecessors-ambitions-im-not-howard-11546857001 |access-date=2023-03-30 |website=WSJ |language=en-US}}</ref> Further development on Reserve coffee shops will be dependent on the success of the few already in existence.
