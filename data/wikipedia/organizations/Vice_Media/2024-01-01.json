This action included the cancellation of ''Vice News Tonight'' and other programs and the layoffs of dozens of employees. In a [[Twitter|tweet]] made by the Vice Union, they criticized the company for repeated layoffs and expressed disappointment over the loss of entire teams. They described the layoffs as part of a pattern where Vice has let go of many who have significantly contributed to the company's success. The Union also condemned the manner of the layoff announcements, which were made via a livestream without opportunity for dialogue and where the executives scarcely acknowledged the ongoing layoffs. The Vice Union has affirmed its support for the affected employees, implying a divergence from the company's past identity as a respected media organization.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-09

It's a shame that the company has proven so resistant to listening to its own staff and facilitating what they want \u2013 a collective voice at work. That the NUJ and its 30,000 members \u2013 including those at Vice \u2013 are not used to the reality of a digital workforce is laughable and shows it's the company who are out of date with 21st century trade unions. Rejecting calls for union recognition from their own journalists and then trying to fob them off with a [[Rupert Murdoch]]-style staff association is a pretty old-fashioned union-busting ruse that misses the point. NUJ officials and reps at Vice will continue with the push for recognition and if the company wants that to be gained through the law forcing their hand rather than through sensible engagement with their staff, so be it.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stanistreet|first1=Michelle|title=Trade union recognition at Vice UK|url=https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/vice-recognition-update/|access-date=19 May 2016|work=National Union of Journalists|date=27 April 2016|archive-date=10 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610132134/https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/vice-recognition-update/|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe NUJ submitted a new request for recognition in March 2019.
