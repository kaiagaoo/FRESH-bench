VMware became well known for its first type 2 hypervisor known as [[VMware Workstation]]. This product has since evolved into two additional hypervisor product lines: VMware's type 1 hypervisors running directly on hardware ([[VMware ESXi|ESX/ESXi]]) and their discontinued hosted type 2 hypervisors ([[VMware Server|GSX]]).\n\nVMware software provides a completely [[Platform virtualization|virtualized]] set of hardware to the guest operating system.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/56702-vmware-workstation-452 | title=VMware Workstation 4.5.2 | first=Jim | last=Lynch | publisher=Extremetech.com | date=July 15, 2004 | access-date=June 14, 2017 | archive-date=October 30, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030144957/http://www.extremetech.com/computing/56702-vmware-workstation-452 | url-status=live }}</ref> VMware software virtualizes the hardware for a video adapter, a network adapter, and hard disk adapters. The host provides pass-through drivers for guest USB, serial, and parallel devices. In this way, VMware virtual machines become highly portable between computers, because every host looks nearly identical to the guest. In practice, a system administrator can pause operations on a virtual machine guest, move or copy that guest to another physical computer, and there resume execution exactly at the point of suspension. Alternatively, for enterprise servers, a feature called vMotion allows the migration of operational guest virtual machines between similar but separate hardware hosts sharing the same storage<ref>{{cite web|title=How VMotion Works|url=http://www.thegeekpub.com/8407/how-does-vmotion-work/|website=The Geek Pub|access-date=5 April 2017|date=2017-04-03|archive-date=2017-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170641/http://www.thegeekpub.com/8407/how-does-vmotion-work/|url-status=live}}</ref> (or, with vMotion Storage, separate storage can be used, too). Each of these transitions is completely transparent to any users on the virtual machine at the time it is being migrated.\n\nVMware's products predate the [[x86 virtualization#Hardware assist|virtualization extensions]] to the x86 instruction set, and do not require virtualization-enabled processors. On newer processors, the hypervisor is now designed to take advantage of the extensions. However, unlike many other hypervisors, VMware still supports older processors. In such cases, it uses the CPU to run code directly whenever possible (as, for example, when running [[user space|user-mode]] and [[virtual 8086 mode]] code on x86). When direct execution cannot operate, such as with kernel-level and [[real mode|real-mode]] code, VMware products use [[binary translation]] (BT) to re-write the code dynamically. The translated code gets stored in spare memory, typically at the end of the [[address space]], which [[Segmentation (memory)|segmentation]] mechanisms can protect and make invisible. For these reasons, VMware operates dramatically faster than emulators, running at more than 80% of the speed that the virtual guest operating system would run directly on the same hardware. In one study VMware claims a slowdown over native ranging from 0\u20136 percent for the VMware ESX Server.<ref>{{cite web| title=A Performance Comparison of Hypervisors| url=http://www.vmware.com/pdf/hypervisor_performance.pdf| publisher=VMware| date=February 1, 2007| access-date=February 1, 2010| archive-date=October 9, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009102005/http://www.vmware.com/pdf/hypervisor_performance.pdf| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Desktop software===\n* [[VMware Fusion]] provides similar functionality for users of the [[Apple\u2013Intel architecture|Intel Mac]] platform, along with full compatibility with virtual machines created by other VMware products.\n* [[VMware Workstation]], introduced in 1999, was the first product launched by VMware. This software suite allows users to run multiple instances of [[x86 architecture|x86]] or [[x86-64]]-compatible operating systems on a single physical [[personal computer]]. Version 17.0 was released on November 17, 2022.\n* [[VMware Workstation Player]] is [[freeware]] for non-commercial use, without requiring a license, and available for commercial use with permission. It is similar to VMware Workstation, with some features not available, including support for UEFI Secure Boot, snapshots, encrypted virtual machines, and some advanced features.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://store-us.vmware.com/compare_workstation |title=Compare Workstation Player and Workstation Pro  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220531080908/https://store-us.vmware.com/compare_workstation |archive-date=31 May 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Server software===\n* [[VMware ESXi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/data-center-consolidation.html|title=What is Data Center Consolidation?|website=VMWare|access-date=2019-02-10|archive-date=2019-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402181513/https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/data-center-consolidation.html|url-status=live}}</ref> an [[enterprise software]] product, can deliver greater performance than the freeware VMware Server, due to lower system [[computational overhead]].
