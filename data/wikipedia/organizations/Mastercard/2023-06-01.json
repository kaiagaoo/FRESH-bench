The suit claims that this is a [[restraint of trade]] in violation of federal law. The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent operators of automated teller machines. More specifically, it is alleged that Mastercard's and Visa's network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN-debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or Mastercard. The suit says that this price-fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs, limits the revenue that ATM operators earn, and violates the [[Sherman Antitrust Act|Sherman Act]]'s prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade. Johnathan Rubin, an attorney for the plaintiffs said, \"Visa and Mastercard are the ringleaders, organizers, and enforcers of a conspiracy among U.S. banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay.\"<ref name=\"ATM\">{{cite press release |title=ATM Operators File Antitrust Lawsuit Against Visa and MasterCard |date=October 12, 2011 |publisher=PR Newswire |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atm-operators-file-antitrust-lawsuit-against-visa-and-mastercard-131605078.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Oceania ===\nIn 2003, the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] required that interchange fees be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% of the transaction to approximately 0.5%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} One notable result has been the reduced use of [[Loyalty program|reward cards]] and increased use of debit cards. Australia also prohibited the no surcharge rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and Mastercard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment. Australia has also made changes to the interchange rates on debit cards and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether.\n\nAs of November 2006, [[New Zealand]] was considering similar actions, following a [[Crown entity|Commerce Commission]] lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Visa and Mastercard. In New Zealand, merchants pay a 1.8% fee on every credit card transaction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Europe ===\nThe [[European Union]] has repeatedly criticized Mastercard for monopolistic trade practices.

The EU's competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non-cash payments. Mastercard was banned from charging fees on cross-border transactions conducted wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in 2007.<ref name=\"Euro\">{{cite news |last1=Chee |first1=Foo Yun |title=MasterCard under EU fire over payment card fees |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/news/2013/04/09/mastercard-under-eu-fire-over-payment-card-fees/ |access-date=September 27, 2020 |work=[[Fox Business]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=April 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629074634/http://www.foxbusiness.com/news/2013/04/09/mastercard-under-eu-fire-over-payment-card-fees/ |archive-date=June 29, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{cbignore|bot=InternetArchiveBot}} The European Commission said that their investigation also included large differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a \u20ac50 payment might cost \u20ac0.10 in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland. The Commission argues that Mastercard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against antitrust law.\n\nThe [[The European Consumer Organisation|European Consumer Organisation]] (BEUC) praised the action against Mastercard. BEUC said interbank fees push up prices and hurt consumers. BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said, \"So in the end, all consumers are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing bank.\"<ref name=\"Euro\" />\n\nIn January 2019, the European Commission imposed an antitrust fine of \u20ac570,566,000 to Mastercard for \"obstructing merchants' access to cross-border card payment services\", due to Mastercard's rules obliging acquiring banks to apply the [[interchange fee]]s of the country where a retailer was located. The Commission concluded that Mastercard's rules prevented retailers from benefitting from lower fees and restricted competition between banks cross border, in breach of [[European Union competition law|EU antitrust rules]]. The infringement of antitrust rules ended when Mastercard amended its rules due to the entering into force of the Interchange Fee Regulation in 2015, which introduced caps on interchange fees. The Commission did grant Mastercard a 10% reduction of the fine however, in return for Mastercard acknowledging the facts and cooperating with the antitrust investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-19-582_en.htm|title=Antitrust: Commission fines Mastercard \u20ac570 million for obstructing merchants' access to cross-border card payment services|date=January 22, 2019|website=europa.eu|publisher=[[European Commission]]|location=Brussels|access-date=January 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2021, following an investigation by the British [[Financial Conduct Authority#Payment Systems Regulator|Payment Systems Regulator]], Mastercard admitted liability for breaching competition rules in relation to pre-paid cards.<ref>{{cite web |title=The PSR provisionally finds five companies broke the law by engaging in cartel behaviour in the pre-paid cards market |url=https://www.psr.org.uk/news-updates/latest-news/news/the-psr-provisionally-finds-five-companies-broke-the-law-by-engaging-in-cartel-behaviour-in-the-pre-paid-cards-market/ |website=[[Payment Systems Regulator|UK Payment Systems Regulator]]|date=March 31, 2021 }}</ref>\n\n== Other issues ==\n\n=== United States internet gambling transactions ===\nMastercard, Visa, and other credit cards have been used to fund accounts since [[online gambling]] began in the mid-1990s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Internet Gambling: An Overview of the Issues |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GAOREPORTS-GAO-03-89/html/GAOREPORTS-GAO-03-89.htm |access-date=2022-05-18 |website=govinfo.gov |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn March 20, 2000, the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]], reviewed motions in ''Re: MasterCard International Inc.'' regarding multi-district litigation alleging Mastercard illegally interacted with a number of internet casinos.

The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments to [[Unbanked|people who do not have bank accounts]]. Comerica Bank is the issuing bank for the debit card.\n\nThe Direct Express cards give recipients a number of [[consumer protection]]s.\n\nIn June 2013, Mastercard announced a partnership with [[British Airways]] to offer members the Executive Club Multi-currency Cash Passport, which will allow members to earn extra points and make multi-currency payments. The Passport card allows users to load up to ten currencies ([[euro]], [[Pound sterling|pound]], U.S. dollar, Turkish lira, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, U.A.E. dirham, and South African rand) at a locked-in rate.

Unlike other Mastercard mobile payment apps such as Pay Pass, QkR does not use [[Near-field communication|NFC]] from the phone, but rather an Internet connection.\n\nUsers can open the app, scan a [[QR code]] located on the back of the seat in front of them, and place orders for refreshments of their choice.<ref>{{cite web |date=January 27, 2012 |title=MasterCard's QkR mobile payment system enters trial in Australia |url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/01/27/mastercards-qkr-mobile-payment-system-enters-trial-in-australia/ |access-date=January 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=January 26, 2012 |title=MasterCard starts piloting QkR mobile payment app |url=http://gigaom.com/2012/01/26/mastercard-starts-piloting-qkr-mobile-payment-app/ |access-date=January 26, 2014}}</ref> The order is dispatched to a nearby concession stand.\n\nQkR is being marketed to vendors as a replacement for other mobile payment apps and a mobile ordering app, either distributed by the vendor (such as [[Starbucks]]'s app, [[McDonald's]]' app, or [[Chipotle Mexican Grill|Chipotle]]'s mobile ordering app) or by a third party, such as [[Block, Inc.|Square]], headed by [[Twitter]] cofounder [[Jack Dorsey]].\n\n=== Mastercard Contactless ===\n[[File:EMVCoContactlessIndicator.svg|50px|right]]\nMastercard Contactless (formerly branded PayPass<ref>{{cite web |date=March 8, 2015 |title=ALERT: Due to licensing changes and rebranding efforts, the Mastercard Contactless (formerly known as PayPass) documentation has been moved |url=https://www.paypass.com/documentation.html/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508030741/https://www.paypass.com/documentation.html |archive-date=May 8, 2015 |work=Mastercard}}</ref>) is an [[EMV]]-compatible, [[contactless payment]] feature similar to American Express' [[American Express#ExpressPay|ExpressPay]], and Visa Contactless.

In 2014, the Apple company released [[Apple Pay]].\n\nDuring late 2015, Citicards in the US stopped issuing Paypass-enabled plastic, but the keyfob was still available upon request. Effective July 16, 2016, Citicards stopped supporting Paypass completely. While existing plastic and keyfobs continued to work until their expiration date, no new Paypass-enabled hardware was issued to US customers after that date.\n\n=== Crypto ===\nIn April 2023, Mastercard announced its intention to expand its partnerships with cryptocurrency firms. At the time of the announcement, the firm had already partnered with [[Binance]], Nexo, and [[Gemini (company)|Gemini]] to offer cards linked to crypto in some nations. This was despite an increasingly intense regulatory environment, and it followed rival company [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] stopping its agreement with [[FTX]] in November 2022. The company said its Mastercard Crypto Credential service would allow for transactions between countries that met requirements like so-called \"travel rule\" by the [[Financial Action Task Force|Financial Action Task Force (FATF)]], using technology from CipherTrace. It also worked with wallet providers Bit2Me, Lirium, Mercado Bitcoin, and Uphold.

The company invested $500M in [[India]] with offices in [[Pune]] and [[Vadodara]] to help Mastercard bring cashless transactions to the 2nd largest population in the world. The company also is scheduled to invest an additional $750M in cashless apps and technology, especially focused on India between 2017 and 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.mastercard.com/asia-pacific/press-releases/mastercard-reinforces-commitment-to-creating-a-world-beyond-cash/|title = Mastercard Reinforces Commitment to Creating a \"World Beyond Cash\"}}</ref>\n\n==Banknet==\n\nMastercard operates Banknet, a global [[telecommunications network]] linking all Mastercard card issuers, acquirers, and data processing centers into a single financial network. The operations hub is located in St. Louis, [[Missouri]]. Banknet uses the [[ISO 8583]] protocol.\n\nMastercard's network differs significantly from [[Visa Inc.|Visa]]'s. Visa's is a star-based system where all endpoints terminate at one of several main data centers, where all transactions are processed centrally. Mastercard's network is an edge-based, peer-to-peer network where transactions travel a meshed network directly to other endpoints, without the need to travel to a single point. This allows Mastercard's network to be much more resilient, in that a single failure cannot isolate a large number of endpoints.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/docs/virtual_private_network.pdf |title=Peer-to-Peer Network Architecture of Banknet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326060638/http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/docs/virtual_private_network.pdf |archive-date=March 26, 2007 |url-status=dead }} Fact Sheet from MasterCard website.

The goal of the partnership is integrating TrustStamp's biometric and facial recognition technology into the Mastercard Well Pass platform. This partnership would enable biometric tracking of vaccinations, especially for children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biometricupdate.com/202007/trust-stamp-integrating-biometric-hash-solution-with-mastercard-on-childrens-vaccine-record-system|title = Trust Stamp integrating biometric hash solution with Mastercard on children's vaccine record system {{pipe}} Biometric Update|date = July 6, 2020}}</ref> The program is based on the TrustStamp Evergreen Hash, which is a personal digital token that is tied to a fingerprint, palm or face. The AI software creates a 3D \"mask\" and then the original data is destroyed. The token would then adapt as the individual does, creating a lifelong identification system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mastercardcontentexchange.com/perspectives/2020/signed-sealed-encrypted-this-digital-id-is-all-yours/|title = Signed, sealed, encrypted: This digital ID is all yours}}</ref>\n\nThis system is now being implemented in [[West Africa]] through partnership with the [[GAVI|Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI)]], [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] and NuData.
