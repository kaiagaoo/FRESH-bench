Founded in 1839 as a textile manufacturer, it underwent a drastic restructuring into a conglomerate starting in 1965 under the leadership of chairman and CEO [[Warren Buffett]] and vice chairman [[Charlie Munger]].

Hathaway had been successful in its first decades, but it suffered during a general decline in the [[textile industry]] after [[World War I]]. At this time, Hathaway was run by [[Seabury Stanton]], whose investment efforts were rewarded with renewed profitability after the [[Great Depression]]. After the merger, Berkshire Hathaway had 15 plants employing over 12,000 workers with over $120&nbsp;million in revenue, and was headquartered in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]]. However, seven of those locations were closed by the end of the decade, accompanied by large layoffs.\n\n=== Transformation into a conglomerate ===\nIn 1962, Warren Buffett began buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway after noticing it was statistically undervalued. Buffett bought the stock with the idea that as Berkshire closed textile mills and freed capital, there would be a [[tender offer]] at some point and they could sell the stock for a profit. Eventually, Buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the company's financial situation was not going to improve. In 1964, Stanton made an oral tender offer to buy back Buffett's stake in the company for $11.50 per share. Buffett agreed to the deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11.375. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry.<ref name=\"worst-trade\">{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232/?video=1618466375&play=1|title=Buffett's Worst Trade|publisher=CNBC|date=February 26, 2009|access-date=July 8, 2011}}</ref> Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire Stanton (which he did). However, this made Buffett the majority owner of a failing textile business.\n\nBuffett initially maintained Berkshire's core business of textiles, but by 1967, he was expanding into the insurance industry and other investments. Berkshire first ventured into the insurance business with the purchase of [[National Indemnity Company]]. In the late 1970s, Berkshire acquired an [[Equity (finance)|equity stake]] in the [[Government Employees Insurance Company]] (GEICO), which forms the core of its insurance operations today (and is a major source of capital for Berkshire Hathaway's other investments). In 1985, the last textile operations (Hathaway's historic core) were shut down.<ref name=\"Shareholder Letter\">{{cite web|url=https://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1985.html|title=Letter to Shareholders|author=Warren Buffett|date=March 4, 1986|website= berkshirehathaway.com|publisher=Berkshire Hathaway|access-date=November 6, 2020|quote=In July we decided to close our textile operation, and by yearend this unpleasant job was largely completed.}}</ref>\n\nBuffett has described purchasing Berkshire Hathaway as the biggest investment mistake he had ever made, denying him compounded investment returns of about $200&nbsp;billion over the subsequent 45 years.<ref name=\"worst-trade\"/> He has estimated that had he invested the same money directly in insurance businesses instead of buying out Berkshire Hathaway (due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual), it would have paid off several hundredfold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/39724884|title=CNBC Transcript: Warren Buffett's $200B Berkshire Blunder and the Valuable Lesson He Learned|publisher=CNBC|date=October 18, 2010|author=Alex Crippen|access-date=September 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929000257/https://www.cnbc.com/id/39724884|archive-date=September 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Corporate affairs==\nBerkshire's [[class A share]]s sold for $465,725 as of January 5, 2022, making them the highest-priced shares on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], in part because they have never had a [[stock split]] and have only paid a [[dividend]] once since Warren Buffett took over, retaining corporate earnings on its balance sheet in a manner that is impermissible for [[mutual fund]]s.

Holders of class A stock are allowed to convert their stock to Class B, though not vice versa.
