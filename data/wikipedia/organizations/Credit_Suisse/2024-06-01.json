As a result, the [[government of Ecuador]] pledged to spend about $18 million annually for two decades on conservation in the [[Galapagos islands]], a UNESCO world heritage site. The bond purchase was below 55% of the purchase value and below 35.5% for the consecutive 5 year-intervals after 2025. Underwriters for that deal is the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) and the [[OPEC Fund for International Development|U.S. International Development Finance Cooperation]], therefore limiting the risk for Credit Suisse. The deal effectively saves Ecuador from liquidity shortages due to an estimated public debt of $66.8 billion.
