In the late 1980s, NBC began pursuing a strategy of diversification, including the formation of two NBC-owned cable-television networks: [[CNBC]] and [[America's Talking]]. NBC also had partial ownership of several regional sports channels and other cable channels such as [[AMC (TV channel)|American Movie Classics]] and [[TruTV|Court TV]] (until 2007).\n\nIn 1995, NBC began operating NBC Desktop Video, a financial news service that delivered live video to personal computers. The following year, NBC announced an agreement with [[Microsoft Corporation|Microsoft]] to create an all-news cable television channel, [[MSNBC]] (using its subscriber base from America's Talking network). A separate joint venture with Microsoft included establishing a news website, MSNBC.com (now [[NBCNews.com]]).<ref>{{Cite web|date=April 23, 2001|title=Microsoft and NBC Join Forces Again To Deliver Personal Finance Powerhouse on the Web|url=https://news.microsoft.com/2001/04/23/microsoft-and-nbc-join-forces-again-to-deliver-personal-finance-powerhouse-on-the-web/|access-date=August 28, 2020|website=Stories|language=en-US|archive-date=April 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210410140457/https://news.microsoft.com/2001/04/23/microsoft-and-nbc-join-forces-again-to-deliver-personal-finance-powerhouse-on-the-web/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, NBC partnered with [[Dow Jones & Co.]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/news/nbc-dow-jones-reveal-merger-details/12739/|title=NBC, Dow jones reveal merger details|access-date=May 30, 2018|language=en|archive-date=April 24, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220424225735/https://adage.com/article/news/nbc-dow-jones-reveal-merger-details/12739|url-status=live}}</ref> The two companies combined their financial news channels outside the United States.
