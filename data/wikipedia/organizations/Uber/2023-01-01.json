Ubers in Europe\u2019s transportation industry are required to follow both the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations Economic Commission (UN ECE) for Europe\u2019s regulations on emissions. For example, London's Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone charges fees for those who drive fossil-fueled vehicles which, as Uber explains in their 2022 10-K filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission,<ref name=\":02\">Uber Technologies, Inc. (2022, February 24). ''Form 10-K''. Mergent Intellect. <nowiki>https://www.mergentintellect.com/</nowiki></ref> makes it harder for them to retain drivers. Another recent update to Europe's regulations has been to reduce diesel emissions. However, these new green advancements in diesel engines could increase costs for drivers, riders, and Uber.<ref>GlobalData. (2022, October. ''Uber Technologies, Inc''. [SWOT report]. D&B Hoovers. <nowiki>http://logon.onesource.com/</nowiki></ref>\n\nAccording to their 2022 10-K filing,<ref name=\":02\" /> Uber disclosed to their shareholders that their company is exposed to risks from climate change and that their business may be negatively affected by these risks. For example, their filing discusses public favorability for electric vehicles and low carbon business plans, and extreme weather and its impacts on the economy like decreased demand and supply-chain disruptions.\n\nUber's climate change initiatives include new programs like Uber Green. In a 2022 interview with the Toronto Star,<ref>The Toronto Star. (March 12, 2022). ''Uber Canada exec takes front seat; Fixing freight, going green - and his most-ordered meal deliveries.'' Nexis Uni. https://www.lexisnexis.com/</ref> Uber's Senior Vice President of Mobility and Business Operations Andrew Macdonald explained that Uber Green gives riders an option to choose a zero or low-emission vehicle for their ride for an extra fee, while Uber gives drivers an extra dollar for every trip done in an electric vehicle. Uber has also committed to using only renewable energy in all of their U.S. offices by 2025, having net zero emissions for their corporate operations by 2023, and being a net zero company by 2040.<ref name=\":02\" /> However, Uber also explained in their 2022 10-K filing<ref name=\":02\" /> that while they are committed to combating climate change by investing their time and resources, they would accelerate or delay their initiatives if they faced uncontrollable circumstances. For example, during the coronavirus pandemic, they explained that they were unable to devote resources to their climate change commitments. Uber acknowledges in this filing how failing to attain their climate-related goals could negatively impact their costs, operations, and company image overall.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Scholarly papers'''\n* {{Cite journal | first1=Christofer | last1=Laurell | first2=Christian | last2=Sandstr\u00f6m | title=Analysing Uber in social media \u2013 disruptive technology or institutional disruption? | journal=International Journal of Innovation Management | volume=20 | issue=5 | pages=1640013 | date=June 28, 2016| doi=10.1142/S1363919616400132 | url=http://hj.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1043806&dswid=47113880 | doi-access=free }}\n* {{cite journal | last=McGaughey | first=E.| title=Uber, the Taylor Review, mutuality, and the duty to not misrepresent employment status | date=2018| journal=Industrial Law Journal| ssrn=3018516}}\n* {{cite web | first=Georgios | last=Petropoulos | title=Uber and the economic impact of sharing economy platforms | url=https://www.bruegel.org/2016/02/uber-and-the-economic-impact-of-sharing-economy-platforms/ | publisher=[[Bruegel (institution)|Bruegel]] | date=February 22, 2016}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Noto La Diega |first1=Guido |title=Uber law and awareness by design.
