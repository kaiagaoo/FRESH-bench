This of course injected a powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual. [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s political enemy\u2014and eventual murderer\u2014Aaron Burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company, called The Manhattan Company, to [[New York City water supply system|provide clean water to New York City]]. The innocuous-looking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise. Within six months of the company's creation, and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe, the company opened a bank, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. Still in existence, it is today JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}</blockquote>\n\nLed by [[David Rockefeller]] during the 1970s and 1980s, Chase Manhattan emerged as one of the largest and most prestigious banking concerns, with leadership positions in [[Syndicated loan|syndicated lending]], treasury and securities services, [[credit card]]s, [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]], and retail financial services.
