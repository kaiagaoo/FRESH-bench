This, of course, injected a powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual. [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s political enemy\u2014and eventual murderer\u2014[[Aaron Burr]] was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company called The Manhattan Company to [[New York City water supply system|provide clean water to New York City]]. The innocuous-looking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise. Within six months of the company's creation, and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe, the company opened a bank, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. Still in existence, it is today JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gordon |first=John Steele |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56668529 |title=An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2004 |isbn=0-06-009362-5 |edition=1st |location=New York |page=115 |oclc=56668529 |author-link=John Steele Gordon}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLed by [[David Rockefeller]] during the 1970s and 1980s, Chase Manhattan emerged as one of the largest and most prestigious banks, with leadership positions in [[Syndicated loan|syndicated lending]], treasury and securities services, [[credit card]]s, [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]], and retail financial services.

That night, the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]], in what was by far the largest bank failure in American history, had seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into receivership. The FDIC sold the bank's assets, secured debt obligations, and deposits to JPMorgan Chase & Co for $1.836&nbsp;billion, which re-opened the bank the following day.\n\nHowever, Chase did not purchase any mortgages in the FDIC receivership as the loans had already been sold off into Washington Mutual-branded mortgage-backed securities long before the receivership happened on September 25, 2008.  If Chase wanted ownership of any Washington Mutual mortgages, they had to purchase them from the FDIC by way of a Receiver's Deed or Bill of Sale. This could not occur, as there were no mortgages on Washington Mutual Bank's books at time of receivership.  Any recorded Assignments of Mortgage claiming that Chase was \"successor in interest\" and that the transfer occurred \"by operation of law,\" would be incorrect.
