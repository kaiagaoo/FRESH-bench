The first president was not Ford, but local banker [[John S. Gray (Michigan)|John S.

Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford.

Because of this assisted driving technology, Ford drivers can now legally take their hands off the wheel on certain roads. Its top speed is {{cvt|80|mph|kph|0|order=flip}}. BlueCruise uses sensors and cameras to regulate the car's speed and to keep track of speed limits and road signs. It also monitors and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles. It also comes equipped with an eye-tracking system. If the driver stops looking at the road then the car will gradually reduce its speed.

In 1970, the [[Ford Taunus]] and the [[Ford Cortina]] came into production with a common base construction, both models being produced in [[left hand drive]] and [[right hand drive]]. Later on, the models became identical and the respective models right- and left-hand-drive exclusively. Rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe, including Belgium and Spain as well as Germany. The [[Ford Sierra]] replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982, drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling, which was soon given nicknames, the \"Jellymould\" and \"The Salesman's Spaceship\".\n\n[[File:Ford's Dunton Technical Centre - geograph.org.uk - 218069.jpg|thumb|Ford's [[Dunton Technical Centre]] in [[Laindon]], United Kingdom, the largest automotive research and development facility in the country,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/news/back-to-the-future-for-ford/302785.article|title=Back to the future for Ford|access-date=February 28, 2012|publisher=The Engineer|date=October 26, 2007|archive-date=March 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314020617/http://www.theengineer.co.uk/news/back-to-the-future-for-ford/302785.article|url-status=live}}</ref> pictured in 2006]]\n\nIn February 2002, Ford ended car production in the UK.

It was still selling well when replaced by the more practical [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]] in 1967.\n\nThe third incarnation of the Ford Escort was launched in 1980 and marked the company's move from rear-wheel-drive saloons to front-wheel-drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector.\n\nThe fourth-generation Escort was produced from 1990 until 2000, although its successor\u2014the [[Ford Focus (international)|Focus]]\u2014had been on sale since 1998. On its launch, the Focus was arguably the most dramatic-looking and fine-handling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next-generation Focus at the end of 2004.\n\nThe 1982 [[Ford Sierra]]\u2014replacement for the long-running and massively popular [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]] and [[Ford Taunus|Taunus]] models\u2014was a style-setter at the time of its launch. Its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy, sharp-edged Cortina, and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold. A series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the front-wheel-drive [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] at the start of 1993.\n\nThe rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw Ford enter the mini-car market in 1976 with its [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]] hatchback.

Ford then developed a relationship with Korea's oldest car manufacturer [[Kia Motors|Kia]] which built vehicles co-engineered with [[Mazda]], later selling the [[Ford Festiva]] from 1988 to 1993, and the [[Ford Festiva|Ford Aspire]] from 1994 to 1997 for export to the United States. With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer [[Mazda]] in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's [[Mazda Familia|Familia]] and [[Mazda Capella|Capella]] as the [[Ford Laser]] and [[Ford Telstar|Telstar]] throughout the region, replacing the European-sourced Escort and Cortina. From 1989 to 1996, Kia imported the [[Mercury Sable]] from Ford in the U.S. and sold them in South Korea as the Kia Sable. Though the Sable was branded and marketed as a Kia, it retained the Mercury badges and emblem. Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the [[Asian financial crisis]]. Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997; in 1998, [[Hyundai Motor Company]] acquired 51% of the company, outbidding Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/kia-motors-corporation-history/|title=Kia Motors Corporation History|publisher=Funding Universe|access-date=July 13, 2012|archive-date=October 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020114303/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/kia-motors-corporation-history/|url-status=live}}</ref> After subsequent divestments,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovers.com/kia-motors/--ID__43264--/free-co-profile.xhtml |title=Kia Motors Corporation |publisher=Hoovers.com |date=October 21, 2010 |access-date=April 24, 2011 |archive-date=November 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104102045/http://www.hoovers.com/kia-motors/--ID__43264--/free-co-profile.xhtml |url-status=live }}</ref> Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50% of the company but remains Kia's largest stakeholder.\n\n{{As of|2020}}, Ford sells the Explorer, Mondeo, and Mustang,<ref>{{cite web | title=Ford Korea | url=https://www.ford.co.kr/ | language=ko | access-date=May 24, 2020 | archive-date=May 12, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200512050534/https://www.ford.co.kr/ | url-status=live }}</ref> as well as the Lincoln Aviator, Continental, Corsair, MKZ, and Nautilus in South Korea.<ref>{{cite web | title=Lincoln Korea | url=https://www.lincoln-korea.com/ | language=ko | access-date=May 24, 2020 | archive-date=June 14, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614150952/https://www.lincoln-korea.com/ | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===South and West Asia===\n[[Ford India Private Limited|Ford India]] began production in 1998 at [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], with its Ford Escort model, which was later replaced by the locally produced [[Ford Ikon]] in 2001.

Swiss team [[Matech Concepts|Matech GT Racing]], in collaboration with Ford Racing, opened a new chapter with the [[Ford GT]], winning the Teams title in the 2008 [[FIA GT3 European Championship]].\n\n====Ford Mustang====\n{{main|Ford Mustang#Racing}}\n[[File:Barbers02.jpg|thumb|A GT racing version of the [[Ford Mustang]], competing in the [[IMSA Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge|Koni Challenge]] in 2005]]\n\nThe [[Ford Mustang]] has arguably been Ford's most successful sports car. [[Jerry Titus]] won the 1965 SCCA Pro B National Championship with a Mustang and the model went on to earn Ford the SCCA [[Trans-Am Series|Trans-Am Championship]] title in both 1966 and 1967. Ford won the Trans-Am Championship again in 1970 with [[Parnelli Jones]] and [[George Follmer]] driving [[Boss 302 Mustang]]s for [[Bud Moore Engineering]]. Ford took the 1985 and 1986 [[IMSA GT Championship|IMSA GTO Championship]] with Mustangs driven by [[John Jones (racing driver)|John Jones]] and [[Scott Pruett]] before returning to Trans-Am glory with a championship in 1989 with [[Dorsey Schroeder]]. Ford dominated Trans-Am in the 1990s with [[Tommy Kendall]] winning championships in 1993, 1995, 1996, and 1997 with [[Paul Gentilozzi]] adding yet another title in 1999. In 2005 the Ford Mustang FR500C took the championship in the Rolex [[IMSA Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge|Koni Challenge]] Series in its first year on the circuit. In 2007, Ford added a victory in the GT4 European Championship. 2008 was the first year of the Mustang Challenge for the Miller Cup, a series that pits a full field of identical factory-built Ford Mustang race cars against each other. Also, in 2008, Ford won the manufacturers championship in the [[IMSA Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge|Koni Challenge]] Series and HyperSport drivers Joe Foster and Steve Maxwell won the drivers title in a Mustang GT.\n\nFord and [[Michelin]] teamed up to provide custom-engineered tires for the [[Ford Performance]] vehicle lineup. [[Ford Performance]] director Dave Pericak said: \"That confidence extends from our upcoming racing effort at Le Mans in 2016 with the all-new [[Ford GT]], to the Ford Performance vehicle lineup, including the [[Shelby GT350]] and F-150 Raptor\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ford Performance and Michelin sign performance tire deal|url = http://www.autoblog.com/2015/11/09/ford-performance-michelin-tire-deal/|website = Autoblog|access-date = December 14, 2015|date = November 9, 2015|first = Noah|last = Joseph|archive-date = December 22, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222162220/http://www.autoblog.com/2015/11/09/ford-performance-michelin-tire-deal/|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n===Touring cars===\n[[File:Winterbottom2008.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ford Performance Racing]] [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] [[V8 Supercar]] at Eastern Creek in Australia in 2008]]\n\nFord has campaigned touring cars such as the [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]], [[Ford Focus (international)|Focus]], [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]], and [[Ford Contour|Contour]]/[[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] and the [[Ford Sierra|Sierra]] [[Cosworth]] in many different series throughout the years. Notably, Mondeo drivers finished 1, 2, and 3 in the 2000 [[British Touring Car Championship]] and Falcon drivers placed 1, 2, and 3 in the [[2005 V8 Supercar Championship Series]].\n\n===Drag racing===\nIn [[drag racing]], [[John Force Racing]] drivers [[John Force]], [[Tony Pedregon]], and [[Robert Hight]] have piloted [[Ford Mustang]] [[Funny Car]]s to several [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]] titles in recent seasons. Teammates [[Tim Wilkerson]] and Bob Tasca III also drive Mustangs in Funny Car.\n\n===Drifting===\nFord has branched out into [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]] with the introduction of the new model Mustang. Most noticeable is the Turquoise and Blue Falken Tires Mustang driven by [[Vaughn Gittin, Jr.]], (A.K.A. \"JR\") that produces 750 RWHP (Rear Wheel Horsepower).\n\n==Environmental initiatives==\n\n===Compressed natural gas===\nThe [[alternative fossil fuel]] vehicles, such as some versions of the [[Crown Victoria]] especially in fleet and taxi service, operate on [[compressed natural gas]]\u2014or CNG. Some CNG vehicles have dual fuel tanks\u2014one for gasoline, the other for CNG\u2014the same engine can operate on either fuel via a selector switch.\n\n===Flexible fuel vehicles===\n[[File:Ford Focus Flexifuel in Madrid with flexifuel badging.jpg|thumb|The Ford Focus Flexifuel was the first [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E85|E85]] [[flexible fuel vehicle]] commercially available in the European market.]]\n\n[[Flexible fuel vehicle]]s are designed to operate smoothly using a wide range of available [[ethanol fuel]] mixtures\u2014from pure gasoline to [[bioethanol]]-gasoline blends such as [[E85]] (85% [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] and 15% gasoline) or [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures|E100]] (neat [[hydrous]] ethanol) in Brazil. Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and flexible fuel vehicles in the U.S. is the general lack of establishment of sufficient [[fueling station]]s, which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive to a wide range of consumers.

Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of [[Ford Escape Hybrid]]s into plug-in hybrids, and SCE will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid.
