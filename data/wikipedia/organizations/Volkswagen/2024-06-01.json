The factory was placed under the control of [[British Army]] officer Major [[Ivan Hirst]], [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers|REME]], a civilian Military Governor with the occupying forces. At first, one plan was to use it for [[List of military vehicles|military vehicle]] maintenance, and possibly dismantle and ship it to Britain. Since it had been used for military production, (though not of KdF-Wagens) and had been in Hirst's words, a \"political animal\" rather than a commercial enterprise\u2014technically making it liable for destruction under the terms of the [[Potsdam Agreement]]\u2014the equipment could have been salvaged as [[war reparations]]. Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid-1947, though heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nOne of the factory's wartime 'KdF-Wagen' cars had been taken to the factory for repairs and abandoned there. Hirst had it repainted green and demonstrated it to British Army headquarters. Short of light transport, in September 1945 the British Army was persuaded to place a vital order for 20,000 cars. However, production facilities had been massively disrupted, there was a refugee crisis at and around the factory, and some parts (such as [[carburetor|carburettors]]) were unavailable. Hirst and his German assistant [[Heinrich Nordhoff]] (who went on to run the Wolfsburg facility after the military government ended in 1949) helped to stabilise the acute social situation while simultaneously re-establishing production. Hirst, for example, used his engineering experience to arrange the manufacture of carburettors, the original producers being effectively 'lost' in the [[East Germany|Soviet zone]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Porter|first1=Lindsay|title=Mr|journal=Thoroughbred & Classic Cars|date=October 1986}}</ref> The first few hundred cars went to personnel from the occupying forces, and to [[Australia Post]].

[[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]] was formed in April 1955 to standardise sales and service in the United States. Production of the Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle increased dramatically over the years, the total reaching one million in 1955.\n\nThe UK's first official Volkswagen importer, Colborne Garages of [[Ripley, Surrey]], started business with importing parts for the models brought home by soldiers returning from Germany.<ref name=uk-import-first/>\n\nCanadian Motors, Limited brought in Canada's first shipment of Volkswagens on 10 July 1952 (shipping order 143075).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The order consisted of 12 vehicles, (3) model 11C, a black, green, and sand colour (3) 11GS, a chestnut brown and two azure blue, (2) 24A-M51 in red, (1) 21A in blue, (1) 23A in blue, (1) 22A beige colour, and one ambulance.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Volkswagens were seen in Canada for the first time at the Canadian National Exhibition in August 1952 and were accepted enthusiastically.

On 17 February 1972, the 15,007,034th Beetle was sold. Volkswagen could now claim the world production record for the most-produced, single make of car in history. By 1973, total production was over 16 million.\n\nTo commemorate its passing the Ford Model T's record sales mark and its victories in the Baja 1000 Mexican races from 1967 to 1971, Volkswagen produced its first limited-edition Beetle. It was marketed as the \"Baja Champion SE\"<ref>All Volkswagen Cars List [https://qesot.com/cars/en/brand/80/ All Volkswagen Cars Models] Qesot.com</ref> in the United States and the \"Marathon\" Superbeetle in the rest of the world.

Dealer-installed options for this limited-edition Superbeetle included the following: white stripes running the length of the rocker-panel, a special shifter knob, bumper overriders, tapered exhaust tips, fake walnut inserts in the dashboard (behind the steering wheel and the glovebox cover) as well as [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] fog lights mounted on the front bumper.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1961\u20131973: Beetle to Golf===\n[[File:Volkswagen Type 3.jpg|thumb|left|A 1963 [[Volkswagen Type 3|VW Type 3 Notchback]] ]]\n\nThe 1961 Type 1 Beetle had a 36&nbsp;hp 1200cc four cylinder air-cooled flat-four opposed OHV engine made of aluminium alloy block and heads. By 1966, the Type 1 came with a 1300cc engine. By 1967 the Type 1 had a 1500cc engine, and 1600cc in 1970. The air-cooled engine lost favour in the United States market with the advent of unleaded petrol and smog controls. These air-cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel-rich in order to control engine over-heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on the US West Coast where the limited-capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularised on the US West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.\n\nVW expanded its product line in 1961 with the introduction of four [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3]] models (Karmann Ghia, Notchback, Fastback, and Variant) based on the new Type 3 mechanical underpinnings. The name 'Squareback' was used in the United States for the Variant.\n\nIn 1969 the larger [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4]] (411 and 412) models were introduced. These differed substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of [[monocoque]]/unibody construction, the option of a fully [[automatic transmission]], electronic [[fuel injection]], and a sturdier powerplant.\n\nIn 1964, Volkswagen acquired [[Auto Union]], and in 1969, [[NSU Motorenwerke AG]] (NSU). The former company owned the historic [[Audi]] brand, which had disappeared after the Second World War. VW ultimately merged Auto Union and NSU to create the modern Audi company, and would go on to develop it as its [[luxury vehicle]] [[marque]]. The purchase of Auto Union and NSU was a pivotal point in Volkswagen's history, as both companies yielded the technological expertise that proved necessary for VW to survive when demand for its air-cooled models went into decline.\n\n[[File:1969 Volkswagen 1600 Type 3 Squareback (17081445566).jpg|thumb|right|1970 VW Squareback (Type III)]]\nVolkswagen added a \"Super Beetle\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Dean |first=Wayne |date=28 October 2006 |url=http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |title=History of the Super Beetle |publisher=superbeetles.com |access-date=6 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506213643/http://www.superbeetles.com/history.htm |archive-date=6 May 2015  }}</ref> (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 differed from the standard Beetle in its use of a [[MacPherson strut]] front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] instead of the usual [[torsion beam suspension|torsion bars]]. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in the model year 1975 and up. The front of the car was stretched {{convert|2|in|mm}} to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.\n\nIn 1973, Volkswagen introduced the military-themed [[Volkswagen 181|Type 181]], or \"Trekker\" in Europe, \"Thing\" in America, recalling the wartime Type 82. The military version was produced for the [[NATO]]-era [[German Army]] during the [[Cold War]] years of 1970 to 1979. The US Thing version only sold for two years, 1973 and 1974.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038791-0007, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Volkswagen Type 4]] [[assembly line]] in [[Wolfsburg]] as of 1973]]\n\nBy late 1972, Volkswagen had decided to cancel the nearly finished [[:File:Volkswagen EA266 prototype Beetle replacement.JPG|typ 266]], a project for a mid-engined car to replace the Beetle, and to focus on front-wheel-drive, water-cooled cars.

Beetle sales had started to decline rapidly in European and North American markets. The company knew that Beetle production had to end, but faced a conundrum of how to replace it. VW's ownership of Audi/[[Auto Union]] proved beneficial. Its expertise in [[front-wheel drive]], and [[water cooling|water-cooled]] engines would help Volkswagen produce a credible Beetle successor. Audi influences paved the way for this new generation of Volkswagens: the Passat, Scirocco, [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], and Polo.\n\nFirst in the series was the [[Volkswagen Passat]] (Dasher in the US), introduced in 1973, a [[fastback]] version of the [[Audi 80]], using many identical body and mechanical parts. Estate/wagon versions were available in many markets. In Europe, the estate/wagon version dominated market share for many years.\n\nIn spring 1974, the [[Volkswagen Scirocco|Scirocco]] followed. The coupe was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Based on the platform of the not yet released [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]], it was built at [[Karmann]] due to capacity constraints at Volkswagen.\n\nThe pivotal model emerged as the Volkswagen Golf in 1974, marketed in the United States and Canada as the Rabbit for the 1st generation (1975\u20131985) and 5th generation (2006\u20132009). Its angular styling was designed by the Italian [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Its design followed trends for small family cars set by the 1959 [[Mini]]&nbsp;\u2013 the Golf had a [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]], water-cooled engine in the front, driving the front wheels, and had a [[hatchback]], a format that has dominated the market segment ever since. Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon the Golf's introduction. It continued in smaller numbers at other German factories ([[Hanover]] and [[Emden]]) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIn 1975, the [[Volkswagen Polo]] followed. It was a re-badged [[Audi 50]], which was soon discontinued in 1978. The Polo became the base of the [[Volkswagen Derby]], which was introduced in 1977. The Derby was for all intents and purposes a [[Three-box styling|three-box design]] of the Polo. After a second model generation, the Derby was discontinued in 1985, although the body style lived on in the form of the Polo classic/Polo saloon until 1991.\n\nPassat, Scirocco, Golf, and Polo shared many character-defining features, as well as parts and engines. They built the basis for Volkswagen's turn-around.\n\n===1974\u20131990: Product line expansion===\n[[File:VW Polo I front 20090810.jpg|thumb|[[Volkswagen Polo Mk1|Volkswagen Polo]] (1975\u20131979 model)]]\n\nWhile Volkswagen's range of cars soon became similar to that of other large European car makers, the Golf has been the mainstay of the Volkswagen line-up since its introduction, and the mechanical basis for several other cars of the company. There have been eight generations of the [[Volkswagen Golf]], the first of which was produced from the summer of 1974 until the autumn of 1983 (sold as the Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Caribe in Latin America). Its chassis also spawned the [[Volkswagen Scirocco]] sport [[coupe]], [[Volkswagen Jetta]] saloon/sedan, Volkswagen Golf [[Cabriolet (automobile)|Cabriolet]] convertible, and [[Volkswagen Caddy]] pick-up. North American production of the Rabbit commenced at the [[Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant]] near [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] in 1978. It would be produced in the United States as the Rabbit until the spring of 1984.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The second-generation Golf hatchback/Jetta sedan ran from October 1983 until the autumn of 1991, and a North American version produced at Westmoreland Assembly went on sale at the start of the 1985 model year. The production numbers of the first-generation Golf has continued to grow annually in South Africa as the [[Volkswagen Citi Golf|Citi Golf]], with only minor modifications to the interior, engine and chassis, using tooling relocated from the [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]] plant when that site began to build the Second Generation car.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 1980s, Volkswagen's sales in the United States and Canada fell dramatically, despite the success of models like the Golf elsewhere. Sales in the United States were 293,595 in 1980, but by 1984 they were down to 177,709.<ref>Flammang, James, ''Volkswagen: Beetles, Buses and Beyond,'' Krause Publications, 1996</ref> The introduction of the second-generation Golf, GTI and Jetta models helped Volkswagen briefly in North America.

They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% [[biodiesel]] fuel.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} For the 2007 model year, however, strict US government emissions regulations had forced Volkswagen to drop most diesels from their US engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines ([[Volkswagen emissions scandal|then thought]]) compatible to US standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]], made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the [[Porsche Cayenne]] and later the [[Audi Q7]]. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass. Volkswagen set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from the \"Concept A\" concept vehicle introduced at the 2006 [[Geneva Auto Show]], and on 20 July 2006, Volkswagen announced that the new vehicle called the [[Volkswagen Tiguan|Tiguan]].\n\nSince the discontinuation of the T4 in 2003 and the decision not to export the T5 to the United States, Volkswagen, coincidentally, lacked a van for its North American lineup. To remedy this, Volkswagen launched the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]] made for the American and Canadian markets, in 2008.\n\nIn September 2006, Volkswagen began offering the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4#Mk4 \"City Golf (Golf City in 2009)\" in Canada, South America & Bora HS in China|City Golf]] and City Jetta only for the Canadian market. Both models were originally the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Mk4 Golf]] and Jetta but were later replaced with the Brazilian versions of the Golf Mk4 and [[Volkswagen Bora|Bora]]. Volkswagen's introduction of such models is seen as a test of the market for a subcompact and, if successful, may be the beginnings of a thriving subcompact market for Volkswagen.\n\n[[File:2006-2010 Volkswagen Passat (3C) sedan (2011-07-17) 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Passat]] (3C)]]\n\nIn May 2011, Volkswagen completed [[Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant|Chattanooga Assembly]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]]. The Chattanooga Assembly plant marked VW's first plant since the plant at New Stanton was closed down. The facility has produced Volkswagen cars and SUVs specifically designed for the North American markets, beginning with the [[Volkswagen Passat NMS|Passat B7]] in 2011.

The first Porsche car, the [[Porsche 64]] of 1938, used many components from the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. The 1948 [[Porsche 356]] continued using many Volkswagen components, including a tuned engine, [[gearbox]] and suspension.\n\nThe two companies continued their collaboration in 1969 to make the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914 and Porsche 914-6]]. (The 914-6 had a 6-cylinder Porsche engine, and the standard 914 had a Volkswagen engine.) Volkswagen and Porsche would collaborate again in 1976 on the [[Porsche 912]]-E (the USA only) and the [[Porsche 924]], which used many [[Audi]] components and was built at Audi's [[Neckarsulm]] facilities. The 924 was originally designated for AUDI. Most [[Porsche 944]] models were built there, although they used far fewer VW components.\n\nThe [[Porsche Cayenne]], introduced in 2002, shares its entire chassis with the [[Volkswagen Touareg]] and [[Audi Q7]], and is built at the same Volkswagen factory in [[Bratislava]] that the other SUVs are built.\n\nIn September 2005, Porsche announced it would increase its 5% stake in Volkswagen to 20% at a cost of \u20ac3&nbsp;billion, with the intention that the combined stakes of Porsche and the government of Lower Saxony would ensure that any hostile takeover by foreign investors would be impossible.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4281864.stm |title=Porsche wants 20% Volkswagen deal &#124; 26 September 2005 |work=BBC News |date=26 September 2005 |access-date=27 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006040107/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4281864.stm |archive-date=6 October 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Speculated suitors included [[DaimlerChrysler]], [[BMW]], and [[Renault]].
