And third, we started to build PayPal's business off eBay.\"<ref name=wallstfolly>{{cite web |url=http://wallstfolly.typepad.com/wallstfolly/2006/01/intel_conferenc.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116122051/http://wallstfolly.typepad.com/wallstfolly/2006/01/intel_conferenc.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 16, 2006 |title=Wall Street Folly: eBay: Conference call transcript \u2013 1/18/06 |publisher=Wallstfolly.typepad.com |access-date=January 20, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==== Phase 1 ====\n\nIn the first phase, payment volumes were coming mostly from the eBay auction website. The system was very attractive to auction sellers, most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards, and for consumers as well. In fact, many sellers could not qualify for a credit card Merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history. The service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund PayPal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances, without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers. PayPal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth, depositing $10 in new users' PayPal accounts.<ref name=wallstfolly/>\n\n==== Phase 2 ====\n\nUntil 2000, PayPal's strategy was to earn interest on funds in PayPal accounts. However, most recipients of PayPal credits withdrew funds immediately. Also, many senders funded their payments using credit cards, which cost PayPal roughly 2% of payment value per transaction.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nTo solve this problem, PayPal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts. Instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds, PayPal started relying on earnings from service charges. They offered seller protection to PayPal account holders, provided that they comply with reimbursement policies. For example, PayPal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over $750.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==== Phase 3 ====\n\nAfter fine-tuning PayPal's business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on eBay, PayPal started its off-eBay strategy. This was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple platforms, despite the slowdown in on-eBay growth and low-single-digit user growth on the eBay site. A late 2003 reorganization created a new business unit within PayPal\u2014Merchant Services\u2014to provide payment solutions to small and large e-commerce merchants outside the eBay auction community. Starting in the second half of 2004, PayPal Merchant Services unveiled several initiatives to enroll online merchants outside the eBay auction community, including:<ref name=wallstfolly/>\n\n* Lowering its transaction fee for high-volume merchants from 2.2% to 1.9% (while increasing the monthly transaction volume required to qualify for the lowest fee to $100,000)\n* Encouraging its users to recruit non-eBay merchants by increasing its referral bonus to a maximum of $1,000 (versus the previous $100 cap)\n* Persuading credit card gateway providers, including [[CyberSource]] and Retail Decisions USA, to include PayPal among their offerings to online merchants.\n* Hiring a new sales force to acquire large merchants such as [[Dell]], [[ITunes|Apple's iTunes]], and [[Yahoo! Store]]s, which hosted thousands of online merchants\n* Reducing fees for online music purchases and other \"micropayments\"\n* Launching PayPal Mobile, which allowed users to make payments using text messaging on their cell phones\n\n=== Global reach ===\n\nPayPal can be used in more than 200 countries/regions.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.paypal.com/al/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide | title=PayPal Global \u2013 All countries and markets \u2013 PayPal | publisher=PayPal | access-date=28 March 2017 | archive-date=October 8, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201008015800/https://www.paypal.com/al/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDifferent countries have different conditions: ''Send only'' (Package Service allows sending only, valid in 97 countries), ''PayPal Zero'' (package suggests the possibility of enrollment, entry, and withdrawal of funds in foreign currency, but the user can not hold the balance PayPal account, operates in 18 countries), ''SRW Send \u2013 Receive \u2013 Withdrawal'' (the possibility of enrollment, input-output and the ability to keep your PayPal account balance in the currency and to transfer to the card when the user sees fit, operates in 41 countries) and ''Local Currency'' (SRW plus opportunity to conduct transactions in the local currency, 21 countries).\n\n==== China ====\n\nIn July 2017, PayPal announced a partnership with [[Baidu]], to allow the Chinese firm\u2018s 100 million mobile wallet users to make payments to PayPal\u2019s 17 million merchants through the Baidu service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/27/baidu-teams-up-with-paypal/|title=Baidu teams up with PayPal to take its Chinese mobile wallet global {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Russell|first=Jon|date=July 27, 2017|access-date=2017-07-28|archive-date=July 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728083905/https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/27/baidu-teams-up-with-paypal/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Crimea ====\n\nIn January 2015, PayPal ceased operations in [[Crimea]] in compliance with international sanctions against Russia and Crimea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tass.ru/en/russia/772897|title=TASS: Russia \u2013 PayPal system stops servicing clients in Crimea|work=TASS|access-date=5 September 2015|archive-date=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213131358/http://tass.ru/en/russia/772897|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== India ====\n\nAs of March 2011, PayPal has made changes to the User Agreement for Indian users to comply with [[Reserve Bank of India]] regulations.<ref>{{cite news|title=PayPal follows RBI to restrict e-payment to Indian merchants|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-01-29/news/28426592_1_personal-payments-paypal-online-payment|access-date=16 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|date=Jan 29, 2011|archive-date=January 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116171723/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-01-29/news/28426592_1_personal-payments-paypal-online-payment|url-status=live}}</ref> The per transaction limit had been set to USD $3,000, since October 14, 2011.

EFTA/E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures. However, because PayPal is a ''payment intermediary'' and not otherwise regulated directly, TILA/Z and EFTA/E do not operate exactly as written once the credit/debit card transaction occurs via PayPal.

The customer can open a dispute within 180 days from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within 20 days from opening the dispute. Buyers using a credit card  might get a refund via [[chargeback]] from their credit-card company. However, in the UK, where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections (that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation) under Section 75 Consumer Credit Act 1974, the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via PayPal.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kukiewicz |first=Julia |url=https://www.choose.co.uk/money/guide/section-75-consumer-credit-act/ |title=Section 75: Credit card purchase protection |publisher=Choose |date=November 1, 2011 |access-date=November 1, 2011 |archive-date=May 14, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220514111602/https://www.choose.co.uk/money/guide/section-75-consumer-credit-act/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAlso, the Financial Ombudsman Service (for the U.K.) position is that section 75 protection does not apply where PayPal or any eMoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction. This leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service. They only would have recourse in the courts, but in any event they cannot because PayPal is incorporated in Luxembourg and, since the UK has left the EU, is now no longer within the jurisdiction of any UK Courts. The key issues that determine the applicability of section 75 are identified very clearly in Office of Fair Trading v Lloyds TSB Bank Plc and others [2006] EWCA Civ 268 7 and the [[Bank of Scotland]] v Alfred Truman (a firm) [2005] [EWHC] 583 (QB).

This method is required for some services, such as when using PayPal through the eBay application on [[iPhone]].\n\nThis [[two-factor authentication]] is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key, although it does not prevent the so-called [[Man in the Browser]] (MITB) attacks.

[[Elon Musk]], co-founder of X.com, which later merged with Confinity to form PayPal, also criticized the change.

Most of the allegations concerned PayPal's dispute resolution procedures. The two lawsuits were merged into one class-action lawsuit (In re: PayPal litigation). An informal settlement was reached in November 2003, and a formal settlement was signed on June 11, 2004. The settlement requires that PayPal change its business practices (including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them EFTA-compliant), as well as making a US$9.25 million payment to members of the class.
