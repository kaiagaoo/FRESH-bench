[[low Earth orbit]] in 1990 <!-- Full date, which shuttle, etc. is in infobox and later in the article. See discussions on talk page and its archives about omission of these details. --> and remains in operation. It was not the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory|first space telescope]], but it is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for [[astronomy]]. The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer [[Edwin Hubble]] and is one of NASA's [[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]]. The [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) controls the spacecraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/|title=Hubble Essentials |website=HubbleSite.org |publisher=[[Space Telescope Science Institute]] |access-date=March 3, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194740/http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/ |url-status=dead |archivedate=March 3, 2016}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nHubble features a {{cvt|2.4|m}} mirror, and its five main instruments observe in the [[ultraviolet]], [[visible spectrum|visible]], and [[near-infrared]] regions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in [[astrophysics]], such as [[Hubble's law#Using Hubble space telescope data|determining the rate of expansion of the universe]].\n\nSpace telescopes were proposed as early as 1923, and the Hubble telescope was funded and built in the 1970s by the United States space agency [[NASA]] with contributions from the [[European Space Agency]]. Its intended launch was in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]]. Hubble was [[STS-31|finally launched]] in 1990, but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly, resulting in [[spherical aberration]] that compromised the telescope's capabilities. The optics were corrected to their intended quality by a [[STS-61|servicing mission]] in 1993.\n\nHubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five Space Shuttle missions have repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. The [[STS-125|fifth mission]] was initially canceled on safety grounds following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] (2003), but after [[Administrator of NASA|NASA administrator]] [[Michael D. Griffin]] approved it, the HST was completed in 2009.

First, the [[angular resolution]] (the smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished) would be limited only by [[Diffraction-limited system|diffraction]], rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere, which causes stars to twinkle, known to astronomers as [[astronomical seeing|seeing]]. At that time ground-based telescopes were limited to resolutions of 0.5\u20131.0 [[arcsecond]]s, compared to a theoretical diffraction-limited resolution of about 0.05 arcsec for an optical telescope with a [[mirror]] {{cvt|2.5|m}} in diameter.

In 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based [[reflecting telescope]] with a mirror {{cvt|3|m}} in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for crewed maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable [[Space Shuttle]] indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|p=32}}\n\n=== Quest for funding ===\nThe continuing success of the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, and the other to determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, [[public spending]] cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nIn 1977, then NASA Administrator [[James C. Fletcher]] proposed a token $5 million for Hubble in NASA's budget. Then NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science, [[Noel Hinners]], instead cut all funding for Hubble, gambling that this would galvanize the scientific community into fighting for full funding. As Hinners recalls:<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/NASA_HQ/Administrators/HinnersNW/HinnersNW_8-19-10.htm\n|title=NASA Headquarters Oral History Project \u2013 Noel W.

There was some opposition on [Capitol] Hill to getting a new start on [Hubble]. It was driven, in large part as I recall, by the budget situation. Jim Fletcher proposed that we put in $5 million as a placeholder. I didn\u2019t like that idea. It was, in today\u2019s vernacular, a \"sop\" to the astronomy community. \"There's something in there, so all is well\".\n\nI figured in my own little head that to get that community energized we\u2019d be better off zeroing it out. Then they would say, \"Whoa, we\u2019re in deep trouble\", and it would marshal the troops. So I advocated that we not put anything in. I don\u2019t remember any of the detailed discussions or whether there were any, but Jim went along with that so we zeroed it out. It had, from my perspective, the desired impact of stimulating the astronomy community to renew their efforts on the lobbying front. While I like to think in hindsight it was a brilliant political move, I\u2019m not sure I thought it through all that well. It was something that was spur of the moment.\n\n[...] $5 million would let them think that all is well anyway, but it\u2019s not. So let\u2019s give them a message. My own thinking, get them stimulated to get into action. Zeroing it out would certainly give that message. I think it was as simple as that. Didn\u2019t talk to anybody else about doing it first, just, \"Let\u2019s go do that\". Voila, it worked. Don\u2019t know whether I\u2019d do that again.\n}}\n\nThe political ploy worked. In response to Hubble being zeroed out of NASA's budget, a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers. Many astronomers met [[United States House of Representatives|congressmen]] and [[United States Senate|senators]] in person, and large-scale letter-writing campaigns were organized.

Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] due to elevated [[radiation]] levels, and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun (precluding observations of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), Moon and Earth. The solar avoidance angle is about 50\u00b0, to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA. Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the FGSs, and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments. If the FGSs are turned off, the Moon and Earth can be observed. Earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat-fields for the WFPC1 instrument. There is a so-called continuous viewing zone (CVZ), within roughly 24\u00b0 of Hubble's [[Orbital pole|orbital poles]], in which targets are not [[occultation|occulted]] for long periods.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 15, 1996 |title=Hubble's Deepest View of the Universe Unveils Bewildering Galaxies across Billions of Years |url=http://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/1996/news-1996-01 |access-date=April 7, 2022 |website=HubbleSite.org |publisher=[[Space Telescope Science Institute]] |language=en |archive-date=July 15, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220715150044/https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/1996/news-1996-01.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Adler |first1=David S. |last2=Kinzel |first2=Wayne |last3=Jordan |first3=Ian |date=August 6, 2014 |editor-last=Peck |editor-first=Alison B. |editor2-last=Benn |editor2-first=Chris R. |editor3-last=Seaman |editor3-first=Robert L. |title=Planning and scheduling at STScI: from Hubble to the James Webb Space Telescope |url=http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?doi=10.1117/12.2054932 |journal=Proc.

However, the loss of light to the large, out-of-focus halo severely reduced the usefulness of the telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging.

The Allen Commission found that a reflective [[null corrector]], a testing device used to achieve a properly shaped non-spherical mirror, had been incorrectly assembled\u2014one lens was out of position by {{convert|1.3|mm|in|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Allen|Angel|Mangus|Rodney|1990|p=7-1|ps=: The spacing of the field lens in the corrector was to have been done by laser measurements off the end of an invar bar. Instead of illuminating the end of the bar, however, the laser in fact was reflected from a worn spot on a black-anodized metal cap placed over the end of the bar to isolate its center (visible through a hole in the cap). The technician who performed the test noted an unexpected gap between the field lens and its supporting structure in the corrector and filled it in with an ordinary metal washer.}} During the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror, [[Perkin-Elmer]] analyzed its surface with two conventional refractive null correctors. However, for the final manufacturing step ([[figuring]]), they switched to the custom-built reflective null corrector, designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances. The incorrect assembly of this device resulted in the mirror being ground very precisely but to the wrong shape. A few final tests, using the conventional null correctors, correctly reported [[spherical aberration]]. But these results were dismissed, thus missing the opportunity to catch the error, because the reflective null corrector was considered more accurate.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|p=512|ps=: \"the firm's optical operations personnel dismissed the evidence as itself flawed. They believed the other two null correctors were less accurate than the reflective null corrector and so could not verify its reliability. Since they assumed the perfection of the mirror and reflective null corrector, they rejected falsifying information from independent tests, believed no problems existed, and reported only good news.\"}}\n\nThe commission blamed the failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.{{sfn|Allen|Angel|Mangus|Rodney|1990|p=10-1}}\n\n=== Design of a solution ===\nMany feared that Hubble would be abandoned.{{sfn|Tatarewicz|1998|p=374}} The design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions, and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem that could be applied at the first servicing mission, scheduled for 1993. While Kodak had ground a back-up mirror for Hubble, it would have been impossible to replace the mirror in orbit, and too expensive and time-consuming to bring the telescope back to Earth for a refit. Instead, the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense, to be added to the telescope at the servicing mission, effectively acting as \"[[Glasses|spectacles]]\" to correct the spherical aberration.<ref>Chaisson, Eric (1994).

It assumed greater importance, as the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics; failure would have resulted in either abandoning Hubble or accepting its permanent disability. Other components failed before the mission, causing the repair cost to rise to $500&nbsp;million (not including the cost of the shuttle flight). A successful repair would help demonstrate the viability of building [[Space Station Alpha]].{{sfn|Tatarewicz|1998|pp=374,378,381,388}}\n\n[[STS-49]] in 1992 demonstrated the difficulty of space work. While its rescue of [[Intelsat 603]] received praise, the astronauts had taken possibly reckless risks in doing so. Neither the rescue nor the unrelated assembly of prototype space station components occurred as the astronauts had trained, causing NASA to reassess planning and training, including for the Hubble repair. The agency assigned to the mission [[Story Musgrave]]\u2014who had worked on satellite repair procedures since 1976\u2014and six other experienced astronauts, including two from STS-49. The first mission director since [[Project Apollo]] would coordinate a crew with 16 previous shuttle flights. The astronauts were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools.{{sfn|Tatarewicz|1998|pp=380-381,384\u2013387}}\n\nHeat had been the problem on prior spacewalks, which occurred in sunlight. Hubble needed to be repaired out of sunlight. Musgrave discovered during vacuum training, seven months before the mission, that spacesuit gloves did not sufficiently protect against the cold of space. After [[STS-57]] confirmed the issue in orbit, NASA quickly changed equipment, procedures, and flight plan. Seven total mission simulations occurred before launch, the most thorough preparation in shuttle history. No complete Hubble mockup existed, so the astronauts studied many separate models (including one at the Smithsonian) and mentally combined their varying and contradictory details.{{sfn|Tatarewicz|1998|pp=384\u2013387}}\n\nService Mission 1 flew aboard [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']] in December 1993, and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over ten days. Most importantly, the [[High Speed Photometer]] was replaced with the [[Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement|COSTAR]] corrective optics package, and WF/PC was replaced with the [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] (WFPC2) with an internal optical correction system. The [[Photovoltaic module|solar arrays]] and their drive electronics were also replaced, as well as four [[gyroscope]]s in the telescope pointing system, two electrical control units and other electrical components, and two magnetometers. The onboard computers were upgraded with added [[coprocessor]]s, and Hubble's orbit was boosted.<ref name=\"Servicing Mission 1\" />\n\nOn January 13, 1994, NASA declared the mission a complete success and showed the first sharper images.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The on-orbit performance of WFPC2 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |first1=J.

STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.{{sfn|Rose|2017|pp=67\u201369}}\n\n=== Data analysis ===\nHubble data can be analyzed using many different packages. STScI maintains the custom-made [[Space Telescope Science Data Analysis System]] (STSDAS) software, which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files, as well as many other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data. The software runs as a module of [[IRAF]], a popular astronomical data reduction program.{{sfn|Rose|2017|pp=68\u201369}}\n\n== Outreach activities ==\n[[File:Horsehead-Hubble.jpg|thumb|In 2001, NASA polled internet users to find out what they would most like Hubble to observe; they overwhelmingly selected the [[Horsehead Nebula]].]]\n[[File:Hubble Space Telescope Scale Model.JPG|thumb|right|One-quarter scale model at the courthouse in [[Marshfield, Missouri]], a hometown of [[Edwin Hubble]]]]\n\nNASA considered it important for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of [[taxpayer]]s to its construction and operational costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.nasa.gov/pdf/1968main_strategi.pdf |title=National Aeronautics and Space Administration 2003 Strategic Plan |publisher=NASA |access-date=November 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116011129/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/1968main_strategi.pdf |archive-date=November 16, 2012}}</ref> After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |last=Harwood |first=William |date=April 22, 2015 |title=How NASA fixed Hubble's flawed vision - and reputation |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/an-ingenius-fix-for-hubbles-famously-flawed-vision/ |access-date=April 7, 2022 |website=CBS News |language=en-US |archive-date=April 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407023213/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/an-ingenius-fix-for-hubbles-famously-flawed-vision/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kessler |first=Elizabeth A. |date=April 24, 2020 |title=How Hubble Changed the Way We Picture Our Universe |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/how-hubble-changed-way-we-picture-our-universe |access-date=April 7, 2022 |website=National Air and Space Museum |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |language=en |archive-date=April 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407032722/https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/how-hubble-changed-way-we-picture-our-universe |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSeveral initiatives have helped to keep the public informed about Hubble activities.\nIn the United States, [[outreach]] efforts are coordinated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Office for Public Outreach, which was established in 2000 to ensure that U.S. taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program.

Most AO systems sharpen the view over a very narrow field\u2014[[Lucky imaging|Lucky Cam]], for example, produces crisp images just 10 to 20 arcseconds wide, whereas Hubble's cameras produce crisp images across a 150 arcsecond (2\u00bd arcminutes) field. Furthermore, space telescopes can study the universe across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, most of which is blocked by Earth's atmosphere. Finally, the background sky is darker in space than on the ground, because air absorbs solar energy during the day and then releases it at night, producing a faint\u2014but nevertheless discernible\u2014[[airglow]] that washes out low-contrast astronomical objects.<ref name=\"Fienberg\">{{cite news |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/sharpening-the-200-inch/ |title=Sharpening the 200-Inch |work=Sky & Telescope |first=Richard |last=Tresch Fienberg |date=September 14, 2007 |access-date=July 1, 2008 |archive-date=August 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828035625/https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/sharpening-the-200-inch/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{{multiple images |total_width=550 |direction=horizontal |align=center |header=Left: image taken by Hubble (2017) vs Right: the image taken by [[James Webb Space Telescope|Webb]] (2022)<ref name=\"NBC-20220712\">{{cite news |last1=Chow |first1=Denise |last2=Wu |first2=Jiachuan |title=Photos: How pictures from the Webb telescope compare to Hubble's -
