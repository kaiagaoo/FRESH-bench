A possible candidate would be [[iridium]] or [[gold]] placed in some of the adjacent molecules or as a thin surface layer so the correct mechanism then propagates throughout the entire lattice similar to a phase transition. As yet, this is speculative; some efforts have been made, notably adding [[lead]] to [[BSCCO]], which is well known to help promote high ''T''<sub>c</sub> phases by chemistry alone. However, [[relativistic effects]] similar to those found in lead-acid batteries might be responsible suggesting that a similar mechanism in [[mercury (element)|mercury]]- or [[thallium]]-based cuprates may be possible using a related metal such as [[tin]].\n\nAny such catalyst would need to be nonreactive chemically but have properties that affect one mechanism but not the others, and also not interfere with subsequent annealing and oxygenation steps nor change the lattice resonances excessively. A possible workaround for the issues discussed would be to use strong electrostatic fields to hold the molecules in place during one of the steps until the lattice is formed.{{original research inline|date=October 2020}}\n<!--Also relevant to the above discussion:<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://phys.org/news/2020-02-quasi-particle-pi-ton.html |title = New quasi-particle discovered: Introducing the Pi-ton}}</ref> which suggests tentatively that a sufficiently complex lattice with the right internal geometry could indeed superconduct well above the \"official\" maximum ever observed for cuprates, 153&nbsp;K, if indeed flowing bipolarons composed of two electrons and two holes are able to sustain a [[supercurrent]].<ref>{{cite web |title=New advance in superconductors with 'twist' in rhombohedral graphite |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-08-advance-superconductors-rhombohedral-graphite.html |website=phys.org |language=en |date=August 2020}}</ref>-->\n\nSome research efforts are currently moving towards [[Ternary compound|ternary]] [[Polyhydride#Superconduction|superhydrides]], where it has been predicted that {{chem|[[Lithium|Li]]|2|[[Magnesium|Mg]]|[[Hydrogen|H]]|16}} ([[bilithium magnesium hexadecahydride]]) would have a {{abbr|''T''<sub>c</sub>|Critical temperature}} of {{convert|473|K|\u00b0C}} at 250&nbsp;GPa<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=Route to a Superconducting Phase above Room Temperature in Electron-Doped Hydride Compounds under High Pressure\n |date=August 26, 2019\n |journal=Physical Review Letters\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.097001\n |quote=The recent theory-orientated discovery of record high-temperature superconductivity ({{abbr|''T''<sub>c</sub>|Critical temperature}}\u223c250&nbsp;K) in sodalitelike clathrate LaH<sub>10</sub> is an important advance toward room-temperature superconductors.
