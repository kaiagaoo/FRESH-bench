This is possible because myeloma cells have lost the ability to synthesize [[Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase|hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase]] (HGPRT), an enzyme necessary for the [[salvage pathway|salvage synthesis]] of nucleic acids. The absence of HGPRT is not a problem for these cells unless the [[de novo synthesis|de novo purine synthesis]] pathway is also disrupted. Exposing cells to [[aminopterin]] (a [[folic acid]] analogue which inhibits [[dihydrofolate reductase]]) makes them unable to use the de novo pathway and become fully [[auxotrophic]] for [[nucleic acids]], thus requiring supplementation to survive.\n\nThe selective culture medium is called [[HAT medium]] because it contains [[hypoxanthine]], aminopterin and [[thymidine]]. This medium is selective for fused ([[hybridoma]]) cells. Unfused myeloma cells cannot grow because they lack HGPRT and thus cannot replicate their DNA. Unfused spleen cells cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybrid cells referred to as hybridomas, are able to grow indefinitely in the medium because the spleen cell partner supplies HGPRT and the myeloma partner has traits that make it immortal (similar to a cancer cell).\n\nThis mixture of cells is then diluted and clones are grown from single parent cells on microtitre wells. The antibodies secreted by the different clones are then assayed for their ability to bind to the antigen (with a test such as [[ELISA]] or antigen microarray assay) or immuno-[[dot blot]]. The most productive and stable clone is then selected for future use.\n\nThe hybridomas can be grown indefinitely in a suitable cell culture medium. They can also be injected into mice (in the [[peritoneum|peritoneal cavity]], surrounding the gut). There, they produce tumors secreting an antibody-rich fluid called [[ascites]] fluid.\n\nThe medium must be enriched during ''[[in vitro]]'' selection to further favour hybridoma growth. This can be achieved by the use of a layer of feeder fibrocyte cells or supplement medium such as briclone. Culture-media conditioned by macrophages can be used. Production in cell culture is usually preferred as the ascites technique is painful to the animal. Where alternate techniques exist, ascites is considered [[ethics|unethical]].<ref>National Research Council (US) Committee on Methods of Producing Monoclonal Antibodies.

Different from traditional hybridoma technology, the newer technologies use molecular biology techniques to amplify the heavy and light chains of the antibody genes by PCR and produce in either bacterial or mammalian systems with [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] technology. One of the advantages of the new technologies is applicable to multiple animals, such as rabbit, llama, chicken and other common experimental animals in the laboratory.\n\n===Purification===\nAfter obtaining either a media sample of cultured hybridomas or a sample of ascites fluid, the desired antibodies must be extracted. Cell culture sample contaminants consist primarily of media components such as growth factors, [[hormone]]s and [[transferrin]]s. In contrast, the ''in vivo'' sample is likely to have host antibodies, [[protease]]s, [[nuclease]]s, nucleic acids and [[virus]]es. In both cases, other secretions by the hybridomas such as [[cytokine]]s may be present. There may also be bacterial contamination and, as a result, [[Lipopolysaccharide|endotoxins]] that are secreted by the bacteria. Depending on the complexity of the media required in cell culture and thus the contaminants, one or the other method (''in vivo'' or ''in vitro'') may be preferable.\n\nThe sample is first conditioned, or prepared for purification. Cells, cell debris, lipids, and clotted material are first removed, typically by centrifugation followed by [[filtration]] with a 0.45&nbsp;\u03bcm filter. These large particles can cause a phenomenon called [[membrane fouling]] in later purification steps. In addition, the concentration of product in the sample may not be sufficient, especially in cases where the desired antibody is produced by a low-secreting cell line. The sample is therefore concentrated by [[ultrafiltration]] or [[Dialysis (biochemistry)|dialysis]].\n\nMost of the charged impurities are usually [[anions]] such as nucleic acids and endotoxins. These can be separated by [[ion exchange chromatography]].<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Vlasak J, Ionescu R |date=December 2008 |title=Heterogeneity of monoclonal antibodies revealed by charge-sensitive methods |journal=Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=468\u2013481 |doi=10.2174/138920108786786402 |pmid=19075686}}</ref> Either [[Ion|cation]] exchange [[chromatography]] is used at a low enough [[pH]] that the desired antibody binds to the column while anions flow through, or [[anion exchange chromatography]] is used at a high enough pH that the desired antibody flows through the column while anions bind to it. Various proteins can also be separated along with the anions based on their [[isoelectric point]] (pI). In proteins, the isoelectric point (pI) is defined as the pH at which a protein has no net charge. When the pH > pI, a protein has a net negative charge, and when the pH < pI, a protein has a net positive charge. For example, [[albumin]] has a pI of 4.8, which is significantly lower than that of most monoclonal antibodies, which have a pI of 6.1. Thus, at a pH between 4.8 and 6.1, the average charge of albumin molecules is likely to be more negative, while mAbs molecules are positively charged and hence it is possible to separate them. Transferrin, on the other hand, has a pI of 5.9, so it cannot be easily separated by this method. A difference in pI of at least 1 is necessary for a good separation.\n\nTransferrin can instead be removed by [[size exclusion chromatography]]. This method is one of the more reliable chromatography techniques. Since we are dealing with proteins, properties such as charge and affinity are not consistent and vary with pH as molecules are protonated and deprotonated, while size stays relatively constant. Nonetheless, it has drawbacks such as low resolution, low capacity and low [[elution]] times.\n\nA much quicker, single-step method of separation is [[protein A/G]] [[affinity chromatography]]. The antibody selectively binds to protein A/G, so a high level of purity (generally >80%) is obtained. The generally harsh conditions of this method may damage easily damaged antibodies. A low pH can break the bonds to remove the antibody from the column. In addition to possibly affecting the product, low pH can cause protein A/G itself to leak off the column and appear in the eluted sample. Gentle elution buffer systems that employ high salt concentrations are available to avoid exposing sensitive antibodies to low pH. Cost is also an important consideration with this method because immobilized protein A/G is a more expensive resin.\n\nTo achieve maximum purity in a single step, affinity purification can be performed, using the antigen to provide specificity for the antibody. In this method, the antigen used to generate the antibody is covalently attached to an [[agarose]] support. If the antigen is a [[peptide]], it is commonly synthesized with a terminal [[cysteine]], which allows selective attachment to a carrier protein, such as [[keyhole limpet hemocyanin|KLH]] during development and to support purification. The antibody-containing medium is then incubated with the immobilized antigen, either in batch or as the antibody is passed through a column, where it selectively binds and can be retained while impurities are washed away. An elution with a low pH buffer or a more gentle, high salt elution buffer is then used to recover purified antibody from the support.\n\n===Antibody heterogeneity===\nProduct heterogeneity is common in monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant biological products and is typically introduced either upstream during expression or downstream during manufacturing.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Liu |first=Hongcheng |last2=Nowak |first2=Christine |last3=Shao |first3=Mei |last4=Ponniah |first4=Gomathinayagam |last5=Neill |first5=Alyssa |date=September 2016 |title=Impact of cell culture on recombinant monoclonal antibody product heterogeneity |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27452958 |journal=Biotechnology Progress |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=1103\u20131112 |doi=10.1002/btpr.2327 |issn=1520-6033 |pmid=27452958}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Xu |first=Yingda |last2=Wang |first2=Dongdong |last3=Mason |first3=Bruce |last4=Rossomando |first4=Tony |last5=Li |first5=Ning |last6=Liu |first6=Dingjiang |last7=Cheung |first7=Jason K |last8=Xu |first8=Wei |last9=Raghava |first9=Smita |last10=Katiyar |first10=Amit |last11=Nowak |first11=Christine |last12=Xiang |first12=Tao |last13=Dong |first13=Diane D. |last14=Sun |first14=Joanne |last15=Beck |first15=Alain |date=2018-12-17 |title=Structure, heterogeneity and developability assessment of therapeutic antibodies |journal=mAbs |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=239\u2013264 |doi=10.1080/19420862.2018.1553476 |issn=1942-0862 |pmc=6380400 |pmid=30543482}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Beck |first=Alain |last2=Nowak |first2=Christine |last3=Meshulam |first3=Deborah |last4=Reynolds |first4=Kristina |last5=Chen |first5=David |last6=Pacardo |first6=Dennis B. |last7=Nicholls |first7=Samantha B. |last8=Carven |first8=Gregory J. |last9=Gu |first9=Zhenyu |last10=Fang |first10=Jing |last11=Wang |first11=Dongdong |last12=Katiyar |first12=Amit |last13=Xiang |first13=Tao |last14=Liu |first14=Hongcheng |date=2022-11-20 |title=Risk-Based Control Strategies of Recombinant Monoclonal Antibody Charge Variants |journal=Antibodies |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=73 |doi=10.3390/antib11040073 |issn=2073-4468 |pmc=9703962 |pmid=36412839 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nThese variants are typically aggregates, [[deamidation]] products, [[glycosylation]] variants, oxidized amino acid side chains, as well as amino and carboxyl terminal amino acid additions.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Beck A, Wurch T, Bailly C, Corvaia N |date=May 2010 |title=Strategies and challenges for the next generation of therapeutic antibodies |journal=Nature Reviews.
