The technology directly writes new genetic information into a targeted DNA site. It uses a [[fusion protein]], consisting of a catalytically impaired [[Cas9]] [[endonuclease]] fused to an engineered [[reverse transcriptase]] enzyme, and a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA), capable of identifying the target site and providing the new genetic information to replace the target DNA nucleotides. It mediates targeted [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]], [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], and base-to-base conversions without the need for [[double strand breaks]] (DSBs) or donor DNA templates.<ref name=\"pmid31634902\">{{cite journal|last1=Anzalone|first1=Andrew V.|last2=Randolph|first2=Peyton B.|last3=Davis|first3=Jessie R.|last4=Sousa|first4=Alexander A.|last5=Koblan|first5=Luke W.|last6=Levy|first6=Jonathan M.|last7=Chen|first7=Peter J.|last8=Wilson|first8=Christopher|last9=Newby|first9=Gregory A.|last10=Raguram|first10=Aditya|last11=Liu|first11=David R.|author11-link=David R.

The pegRNA consists of an extended [[Guide RNA|single guide RNA (sgRNA)]] containing a primer binding site (PBS) and a [[reverse transcriptase]] (RT) template sequence. During genome editing, the primer binding site allows the 3\u2019 end of the nicked DNA strand to hybridize to the pegRNA, while the RT template serves as a template for the synthesis of edited genetic information.<ref name=pmid31634902/>\n* A fusion protein consisting of a [[Cas9 nickase|Cas9 H840A nickase]] fused to a Moloney [[Murine leukemia virus|Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV)]] [[reverse transcriptase]].<ref name=pmid31634902/><ref name=\"Lin-et-al-2020\" /><ref name=\"Zhu-et-al-2020\" />\n**'''Cas9 H840A nickase:''' the [[Cas9]] enzyme contains two nuclease domains that can cleave DNA sequences, a RuvC domain that cleaves the non-target strand and a HNH domain that cleaves the target strand. The introduction of a H840A substitution in Cas9, through which the 840th amino acid histidine is replaced by an alanine, inactivates the HNH domain. With only the RuvC functioning domain, the catalytically impaired Cas9 introduces a single strand nick, hence the name [[nickase]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ran |first1=F.

[[Transfection]] is often accomplished by introducing vectors into a cell. Once internalized, the fusion protein nicks the target DNA sequence, exposing a 3\u2019-hydroxyl group that can be used to initiate (prime) the [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|reverse transcription]] of the RT template portion of the pegRNA. This results in a branched intermediate that contains two DNA flaps: a 3\u2019 flap that contains the newly synthesized (edited) sequence, and a 5\u2019 flap that contains the dispensable, unedited DNA sequence. The 5\u2019 flap is then cleaved by structure-specific [[endonuclease]]s or 5\u2019 [[exonuclease]]s. This process allows 3\u2019 flap ligation, and creates a heteroduplex DNA composed of one edited strand and one unedited strand. The reannealed double stranded DNA contains nucleotide mismatches at the location where editing took place. In order to correct the mismatches, the cells exploit the intrinsic [[DNA mismatch repair|mismatch repair]]  (MMR)  mechanism, with two possible outcomes: (i) the information in the edited strand is copied into the complementary strand, permanently installing the edit; (ii) the original nucleotides are re-incorporated into the edited strand, excluding the edit.<ref name=pmid31634902/>\n\n== Development process ==\nDuring the development of this technology, several modifications were done to the components, in order to increase its effectiveness.<ref name=pmid31634902/>\n\n=== Prime editor 1 ===\nIn the first system, a wild-type Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase was fused to the Cas9 H840A nickase C-terminus. Detectable editing efficiencies were observed.<ref name=pmid31634902/>\n\n=== Prime editor 2 ===\nIn order to enhance DNA-RNA affinity, enzyme processivity, and thermostability, five amino acid substitutions were incorporated into the M-MLV reverse transcriptase. The mutant M-MLV RT was then incorporated into PE1 to give rise to (Cas9 (H840A)-M-MLV RT(D200N/L603W/T330P/T306K/W313F)). Efficiency improvement was observed over PE1.<ref name=pmid31634902/>\n[[File:PE3_system_for_prime_editing.png|thumb|PE3 system for prime editing]]\n\n=== Prime editor 3 ===\nDespite its increased efficacy, the edit inserted by PE2 might still be removed due to DNA mismatch repair of the edited strand. To avoid this problem during DNA heteroduplex resolution, an additional single guide RNA (sgRNA) is introduced. This sgRNA is designed to match the edited sequence introduced by the pegRNA, but not the original allele. It directs the Cas9 nickase portion of the fusion protein to nick the unedited strand at a nearby site, opposite to the original nick. Nicking the non-edited strand causes the cell's natural repair system to copy the information in the edited strand to the complementary strand, permanently installing the edit.<ref name=pmid31634902/> However, there are drawbacks to this system as nicking the unaltered strand can lead to additional undesired [[indels]]. <ref name=\"Chen 2021 - Enhanced Prime Editing System\">{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Peter |title=Enhanced Prime Editing Systems By Manipulating Cellular Determinants of Editing Outcomes |journal=Cell |date=October 28, 2021 |volume=184 |issue=22 |pages=5635\u20135652.e29 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2021.09.018|pmid=34653350 |pmc=8584034 }}</ref>\n\n=== Prime Editor 4 ===\nPrime editor 4 utilizes the same machinery as PE2, but also includes a plasmid that encodes for dominant negative MMR protein [[MLH1]]. Dominant negative MLH1 is able to essentially knock out endogenous MLH1 by inhibition, thereby reducing cellular MMR response and increasing prime editing efficiency.<ref name=\"Chen 2021 - Enhanced Prime Editing System\" />\n\n=== Prime Editor 5 ===\nPrime editor 5 utilizes the same machinery as PE3, but also includes a plasmid that encodes for dominant negative MLH1. Like PE4, this allows for a knockdown of endogenous MMR response, increasing the efficiency of prime editing.<ref name=\"Chen 2021 - Enhanced Prime Editing System\" /> \n\n=== Nuclease Prime Editor ===\nNuclease Prime Editor uses Cas9 nuclease instead of Cas9(H840A) nickase. Unlike prime editor 3 (PE3) that requires dual-nick at both DNA strands to induce efficient prime editing, Nuclease Prime Editor requires only a single pegRNA since the single-gRNA already creates double-strand break instead of single-strand nick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adikusuma |first1=Fatwa |last2=Lushington |first2=Caleb |last3=Arudkumar |first3=Jayshen |last4=Godahewa |first4=Gelshan |last5=Chey |first5=Yu C J |last6=Gierus |first6=Luke |last7=Geiger |first7=Ashleigh |last8=Jain |first8=Yatish |last9=Reti |first9=Daniel |last10=Wilson |first10=Laurence O W |last11=Bower |first11=Denis C |last12=Thomas |first12=Paul Q |title=Optimized nickase- and nuclease-based prime editing in human and mouse cells |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=17 September 2021 |volume=49 |issue=18 |pages=10785\u201310795 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkab792 |pmid=34534334 |pmc=8501948 |url=https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/18/10785/6371974}}</ref>\n\n=== Twin Prime Editing ===\nThe \"twin prime editing\" (twinPE) mechanism reported in 2021 allows editing large sequences of DNA \u2013 sequences as large as genes \u2013 which addresses the method's key drawback.

The prime editing technology has the potential to correct the vast majority of pathogenic alleles that cause genetic diseases, as it can repair insertions, deletions, and nucleotide substitutions.<ref name=pmid31634902/>\n\n=== Advantages ===\nThe prime editing tool offers advantages over traditional gene editing technologies. [[CRISPR/Cas9]] edits rely on [[Non-homologous end joining|non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)]] or [[Homology directed repair|homology-directed repair (HDR)]] to fix DNA breaks, while the prime editing system employs [[DNA mismatch repair]]. This is an important feature of this technology given that DNA repair mechanisms such as NHEJ and HDR, generate unwanted, random [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]] or [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] (INDELs). These are byproducts that complicate the retrieval of cells carrying the correct edit.<ref name=pmid31634902/><ref name=Sheridan2019>{{cite journal |last1=Sheridan |first1=Cormac |title=Gene editing enters 'prime' time |journal=Nature Biotechnology |date=7 November 2019 |doi=10.1038/d41587-019-00032-5 |pmid=33154577 |s2cid=209564966 }}</ref>\n\nThe prime system introduces single-stranded DNA breaks instead of the double-stranded DNA breaks observed in other editing tools, such as base editors. Collectively, base editing and prime editing offer complementary strengths and weaknesses for making targeted transition mutations. Base editors offer higher editing efficiency and fewer INDEL byproducts if the desired edit is a transition point mutation and a [[Protospacer adjacent motif|PAM sequence]] exists roughly 15 bases from the target site. However, because the prime editing technology does not require a precisely positioned PAM sequence to target a nucleotide sequence, it offers more flexibility and editing precision. Remarkably, prime editors allow all types of substitutions, [[Transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s to be inserted into the target sequence.<ref name=pmid31634902/><ref name=Sheridan2019/> [[Cytosine base editing]] and [[adenine base editing|adenine BE]] can already perform precise [[base transition]]s but for [[base transversion]]s there have been no good options. Prime editing performs transversions with good usability. PE can insert up to 44bp, delete up to 80, or combinations thereof.<ref name=\"Zhu-et-al-2020\">{{cite journal | last1=Zhu | first1=Haocheng | last2=Li | first2=Chao | last3=Gao | first3=Caixia | title=Applications of CRISPR\u2013Cas in agriculture and plant biotechnology | journal=[[Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology]] | publisher=[[Nature Portfolio]] | volume=21 | issue=11 | date=2020-09-24 | issn=1471-0072 | doi=10.1038/s41580-020-00288-9 | pages=661\u2013677| pmid=32973356 | s2cid=221918795 }}</ref>\n\nBecause the prime system involves three separate DNA binding events (between (i) the guide sequence and the target DNA, (ii) the primer binding site and the target DNA, and (iii) the 3\u2019 end of the nicked DNA strand and the pegRNA), it has been suggested to have fewer undesirable off-target effects than [[CRISPR/Cas9]].<ref name=pmid31634902/><ref name=Sheridan2019/>\n\n=== Limitations ===\nThere is considerable interest in applying gene-editing methods to the treatment of diseases with a genetic component.

Introducing exogenous gene editing technologies into living organisms is a significant challenge. One potential way to introduce a base editor into animals and plants is to package the base editor into a viral capsid. The target organism can then be transduced by the virus to synthesize the base editor ''in vivo''. Common laboratory vectors of transduction such as [[lentivirus]] cause immune responses in humans, so proposed human therapies often centered around [[adeno-associated virus]] (AAV) because AAV infections are largely asymptomatic.
