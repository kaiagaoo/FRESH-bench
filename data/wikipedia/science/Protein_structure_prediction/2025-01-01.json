Structure prediction is different from the inverse problem of [[protein design]]. \n\nProtein structure prediction is one of the most important goals pursued by [[computational biology]] and addresses [[Levinthal's paradox]]. Accurate structure prediction has important applications in [[medicine]] (for example, in [[drug design]]) and [[biotechnology]] (for example, in novel [[enzyme]] design).\n\nStarting in 1994, the performance of current methods is assessed biannually in the ''Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction'' ([[CASP]]) experiment. A continuous evaluation of protein structure prediction web servers is performed by the community project ''Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn'' ([[CAMEO3D]]).\n\n==Protein structure and terminology==\nProteins are chains of [[amino acid]]s joined together by [[peptide bond]]s. Many conformations of this chain are possible due to the rotation of the main chain about the two torsion angles \u03c6 and \u03c8 at the C\u03b1 atom (see figure). This conformational flexibility is responsible for differences in the three-dimensional structure of proteins. The peptide bonds in the chain are polar, i.e. they have separated positive and negative charges (partial charges) in the [[carbonyl group]], which can act as hydrogen bond acceptor and in the NH group, which can act as hydrogen bond donor. These groups can therefore interact in the protein structure. Proteins consist mostly of 20 different types of L-\u03b1-amino acids (the [[proteinogenic amino acid]]s). These can be classified according to the chemistry of the side chain, which also plays an important structural role. [[Glycine]] takes on a special position, as it has the smallest side chain, only one hydrogen atom, and therefore can increase the local flexibility in the protein structure. [[Cysteine]] in contrast can react with another cysteine residue to form one cystine and thereby form a cross link stabilizing the whole structure.\n\nThe protein structure can be considered as a sequence of secondary structure elements, such as [[alpha helix|\u03b1 helices]] and [[beta sheet|\u03b2 sheets]]. In these secondary structures, regular patterns of H-bonds are formed between the main chain NH and CO groups of spatially neighboring amino acids, and the amino acids have similar [[Dihedral angle#Proteins|\u03a6 and \u03c8\nangles]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature.

The secondary structures can be tightly packed in the protein core in a hydrophobic environment, but they can also present at the polar protein surface. Each amino acid side chain has a limited volume to occupy and a limited number of possible interactions with other nearby side chains, a situation that must be taken into account in molecular modeling and alignments.<ref name=\"Mount\">{{cite book |author=Mount DM |title=Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-87969-712-9 |volume=2}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">Yousif, Ragheed Hussam, et al. \"Exploring the Molecular Interactions between Neoculin and the Human Sweet Taste Receptors through Computational Approaches.\" ''Sains Malaysiana'' 49.3 (2020): 517-525.</ref>\n\n===\u03b1-helix===\n{{Main|\u03b1-helix}}\n[[File:Alpha helix.png|thumb|right|100px|An alpha-helix with hydrogen bonds (yellow dots)]]\nThe \u03b1-helix is the most abundant type of secondary structure in proteins. The \u03b1-helix has 3.6 amino acids per turn with an H-bond formed between every fourth residue; the average length is 10 amino acids (3 turns) or 10 [[Angstrom|\u00c5]] but varies from 5 to 40 (1.5 to 11 turns). The alignment of the H-bonds creates a dipole moment for the helix with a resulting partial positive charge at the amino end of the helix. Because this region has free NH<small>2</small> groups, it will interact with negatively charged groups such as phosphates. The most common location of \u03b1-helices is at the surface of protein cores, where they provide an interface with the aqueous environment. The inner-facing side of the helix tends to have hydrophobic amino acids and the outer-facing side hydrophilic amino acids. Thus, every third of four amino acids along the chain will tend to be hydrophobic, a pattern that can be quite readily detected. In the leucine zipper motif, a repeating pattern of leucines on the facing sides of two adjacent helices is highly predictive of the motif. A helical-wheel plot can be used to show this repeated pattern. Other \u03b1-helices buried in the protein core or in cellular membranes have a higher and more regular distribution of hydrophobic amino acids, and are highly predictive of such structures. Helices exposed on the surface have a lower proportion of hydrophobic amino acids. Amino acid content can be predictive of an \u03b1-helical region. Regions richer in [[alanine]] (A), [[glutamic acid]] (E), [[leucine]] (L), and [[methionine]] (M) and poorer in [[proline]] (P), [[glycine]] (G), [[tyrosine]] (Y), and [[serine]] (S) tend to form an \u03b1-helix. Proline destabilizes or breaks an \u03b1-helix but can be present in longer helices, forming a bend.\n\n===\u03b2-sheet===\n{{Main|\u03b2 sheet}}\n\u03b2-sheets are formed by H-bonds between an average of 5\u201310 consecutive amino acids in one portion of the chain with another 5\u201310 farther down the chain. The interacting regions may be adjacent, with a short loop in between, or far apart, with other structures in between. Every chain may run in the same direction to form a parallel sheet, every other chain may run in the reverse chemical direction to form an anti parallel sheet, or the chains may be parallel and anti parallel to form a mixed sheet. The pattern of H bonding is different in the parallel and anti parallel configurations. Each amino acid in the interior strands of the sheet forms two H-bonds with neighboring amino acids, whereas each amino acid on the outside strands forms only one bond with an interior strand. Looking across the sheet at right angles to the strands, more distant strands are rotated slightly counterclockwise to form a left-handed twist. The C\u03b1-atoms alternate above and below the sheet in a pleated structure, and the R side groups of the amino acids alternate above and below the pleats. The \u03a6 and \u03a8 angles of the amino acids in sheets vary considerably in one region of the [[Ramachandran plot]]. It is more difficult to predict the location of \u03b2-sheets than of \u03b1-helices. The situation improves somewhat when the amino acid variation in multiple sequence alignments is taken into account.\n\n===Deltas===\nSome parts of the protein have fixed three-dimensional structure, but do not form any regular structures. They should not be confused with [[Intrinsically disordered proteins|disordered or unfolded segments]] of proteins or [[random coil]], an unfolded polypeptide chain lacking any fixed three-dimensional structure. These parts are frequently called \"[[Coordination_complex#Optical_isomerism|deltas]]\" (''\u0394'') because they connect \u03b2-sheets and \u03b1-helices. Deltas are usually located at protein surface, and therefore mutations of their residues are more easily tolerated. Having more substitutions, insertions, and deletions in a certain region of a sequence alignment maybe an indication of some delta. The positions of [[introns]] in genomic DNA may correlate with the locations of loops in the encoded protein {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. Deltas also tend to have charged and polar amino acids and are frequently a component of active sites.\n\n==Protein classification==\n\nProteins may be classified according to both structural and sequential similarity. For structural classification, the sizes and spatial arrangements of secondary structures described in the above paragraph are compared in known three-dimensional structures. Classification based on sequence similarity was historically the first to be used. Initially, similarity based on alignments of whole sequences was performed. Later, proteins were classified on the basis of the occurrence of conserved amino acid patterns. [[Databases]] that classify proteins by one or more of these schemes are available.\nIn considering protein classification schemes, it is important to keep several observations in mind. First, two entirely different protein sequences from different evolutionary origins may fold into a similar structure. Conversely, the sequence of an ancient gene for a given structure may have diverged considerably in different species while at the same time maintaining the same basic structural features. Recognizing any remaining sequence similarity in such cases may be a very difficult task. Second, two proteins that share a significant degree of sequence similarity either with each other or with a third sequence also share an evolutionary origin and should share some structural features also. However, gene duplication and genetic rearrangements during evolution may give rise to new gene copies, which can then evolve into proteins with new function and structure.<ref name=\"Mount\"/>\n\n===Terms used for classifying protein structures and sequences===<!-- These terms may vary in definition on different databases and resources. Do not rely on these definitions as correct. -->\nThe more commonly used terms for evolutionary and structural relationships among proteins are listed below. Many additional terms are used for various kinds of structural features found in proteins. Descriptions of such terms may be found at the CATH Web site, the [[Structural Classification of Proteins]] (SCOP) Web site, and a [[Glaxo Wellcome]] tutorial on the Swiss bioinformatics Expasy Web site.{{Cn|date=October 2024}}\n\n;[[Active site]]: a localized combination of amino acid side groups within the tertiary (three-dimensional) or quaternary (protein subunit) structure that can interact with a chemically specific substrate and that provides the protein with biological activity. Proteins of very different amino acid sequences may fold into a structure that produces the same active site.\n;Architecture: is the relative orientations of secondary structures in a three-dimensional structure without regard to whether or not they share a similar loop structure.\n;Fold (topology): a type of architecture that also has a conserved loop structure.\n;Blocks: is a conserved amino acid sequence pattern in a family of proteins. The pattern includes a series of possible matches at each position in the represented sequences, but there are not any inserted or deleted positions in the pattern or in the sequences. By way of contrast, sequence profiles are a type of scoring matrix that represents a similar set of patterns that includes insertions and deletions.\n;[[protein fold class|Class]]: a term used to classify protein domains according to their secondary structural content and organization. Four [[protein fold class|classes]] were originally recognized by Levitt and Chothia (1976), and several others have been added in the SCOP database. Three classes are given in the CATH database: mainly-\u03b1, mainly-\u03b2, and \u03b1\u2013\u03b2, with the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 class including both alternating \u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b1+\u03b2 structures.\n;Core: the portion of a folded protein molecule that comprises the hydrophobic interior of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets. The compact structure brings together side groups of amino acids into close enough proximity so that they can interact. When comparing protein structures, as in the SCOP database, core is the region common to most of the structures that share a common fold or that are in the same superfamily. In structure prediction, core is sometimes defined as the arrangement of secondary structures that is likely to be conserved during evolutionary change.\n;[[protein domain|Domain]] (sequence context): a segment of a polypeptide chain that can fold into a three-dimensional structure irrespective of the presence of other segments of the chain. The separate domains of a given protein may interact extensively or may be joined only by a length of polypeptide chain. A protein with several domains may use these domains for functional interactions with different molecules.\n;[[protein family|Family]] (sequence context): a group of proteins of similar biochemical function that are more than 50% identical when aligned. This same cutoff is still used by the [[Protein Information Resource]] (PIR). A protein family comprises proteins with the same function in different organisms (orthologous sequences) but may also include proteins in the same organism (paralogous sequences) derived from gene duplication and rearrangements. If a multiple sequence alignment of a protein family reveals a common level of similarity throughout the lengths of the proteins, PIR refers to the family as a homeomorphic family. The aligned region is referred to as a homeomorphic domain, and this region may comprise several smaller homology domains that are shared with other families. Families may be further subdivided into subfamilies or grouped into superfamilies based on respective higher or lower levels of sequence similarity. The SCOP database reports 1296 families and the CATH database (version 1.7 beta), reports 1846 families.\n:When the sequences of proteins with the same function are examined in greater detail, some are found to share high sequence similarity. They are obviously members of the same family by the above criteria. However, others are found that have very little, or even insignificant, sequence similarity with other family members. In such cases, the family relationship between two distant family members A and C can often be demonstrated by finding an additional family member B that shares significant similarity with both A and C. Thus, B provides a connecting link between A and C. Another approach is to examine distant alignments for highly conserved matches.\n:At a level of identity of 50%, proteins are likely to have the same three-dimensional structure, and the identical atoms in the sequence alignment will also superimpose within approximately 1 \u00c5 in the structural model. Thus, if the structure of one member of a family is known, a reliable prediction may be made for a second member of the family, and the higher the identity level, the more reliable the prediction. Protein structural modeling can be performed by examining how well the amino acid substitutions fit into the core of the three-dimensional structure.\n;Family (structural context): as used in the FSSP database ([[Families of structurally similar proteins]]) and the DALI/FSSP Web site, two structures that have a significant level of structural similarity but not necessarily significant sequence similarity.\n;Fold: similar to structural motif, includes a larger combination of secondary structural units in the same configuration. Thus, proteins sharing the same fold have the same combination of secondary structures that are connected by similar loops. An example is the Rossman fold comprising several alternating \u03b1 helices and parallel \u03b2 strands. In the SCOP, CATH, and FSSP databases, the known protein structures have been classified into hierarchical levels of structural complexity with the fold as a basic level of classification.\n;Homologous domain (sequence context): an extended sequence pattern, generally found by sequence alignment methods, that indicates a common evolutionary origin among the aligned sequences. A homology domain is generally longer than motifs. The domain may include all of a given protein sequence or only a portion of the sequence. Some domains are complex and made up of several smaller homology domains that became joined to form a larger one during evolution. A domain that covers an entire sequence is called the homeomorphic domain by PIR ([[Protein Information Resource]]).\n;Module: a region of conserved amino acid patterns comprising one or more motifs and considered to be a fundamental unit of structure or function. The presence of a module has also been used to classify proteins into families.\n;[[protein motif|Motif]] (sequence context): a conserved pattern of amino acids that is found in two or more proteins. In the [[Prosite]] catalog, a motif is an amino acid pattern that is found in a group of proteins that have a similar biochemical activity, and that often is near the active site of the protein. Examples of sequence motif databases are the Prosite catalog and the Stanford Motifs Database.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang JY, Brutlag DL |date=January 2001 |title=The EMOTIF database |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=202\u20134 |pmid=11125091 |pmc=29837 |doi=10.1093/nar/29.1.202}}</ref>\n;Motif (structural context): a combination of several secondary structural elements produced by the folding of adjacent sections of the polypeptide chain into a specific three-dimensional configuration. An example is the helix-loop-helix motif. Structural motifs are also referred to as supersecondary structures and folds.\n;[[Position-specific scoring matrix]] (sequence context, also known as weight or scoring matrix): represents a conserved region in a multiple sequence alignment with no gaps. Each matrix column represents the variation found in one column of the multiple sequence alignment.\n;[[Position-specific scoring matrix]]\u20143D (structural context): represents the amino acid variation found in an alignment of proteins that fall into the same structural class. Matrix columns represent the amino acid variation found at one amino acid position in the aligned structures.\n;[[Protein primary structure|Primary structure]]: the linear amino acid sequence of a protein, which chemically is a polypeptide chain composed of amino acids joined by peptide bonds.\n;[[Sequence profiling tool|Profile (sequence context)]]: a scoring matrix that represents a multiple sequence alignment of a protein family. The profile is usually obtained from a well-conserved region in a multiple sequence alignment. The profile is in the form of a matrix with each column representing a position in the alignment and each row one of the amino acids. Matrix values give the likelihood of each amino acid at the corresponding position in the alignment. The profile is moved along the target sequence to locate the best scoring regions by a dynamic programming algorithm. Gaps are allowed during matching and a gap penalty is included in this case as a negative score when no amino acid is matched. A sequence profile may also be represented by a [[hidden Markov model]], referred to as a profile HMM.\n;Profile (structural context): a scoring matrix that represents which amino acids should fit well and which should fit poorly at sequential positions in a known protein structure. Profile columns represent sequential positions in the structure, and profile rows represent the 20 amino acids. As with a sequence profile, the structural profile is moved along a target sequence to find the highest possible alignment score by a dynamic programming algorithm. Gaps may be included and receive a penalty. The resulting score provides an indication as to whether or not the target protein might adopt such a structure.\n;[[protein quaternary structure|Quaternary structure]]: the three-dimensional configuration of a protein molecule comprising several independent polypeptide chains.\n;[[protein secondary structure|Secondary structure]]: the interactions that occur between the C, O, and NH groups on amino acids in a polypeptide chain to form \u03b1-helices, \u03b2-sheets, turns, loops, and other forms, and that facilitate the folding into a three-dimensional structure.\n;[[Protein superfamily|Superfamily]]: a group of protein families of the same or different lengths that are related by distant yet detectable sequence similarity. Members of a given [[protein superfamily|superfamily]] thus have a common evolutionary origin. Originally, Dayhoff defined the cutoff for superfamily status as being the chance that the sequences are not related of 10 6, on the basis of an alignment score (Dayhoff et al. 1978). Proteins with few identities in an alignment of the sequences but with a convincingly common number of structural and functional features are placed in the same superfamily. At the level of three-dimensional structure, superfamily proteins will share common structural features such as a common fold, but there may also be differences in the number and arrangement of secondary structures. The PIR resource uses the term ''homeomorphic superfamilies'' to refer to superfamilies that are composed of sequences that can be aligned from end to end, representing a sharing of single sequence homology domain, a region of similarity that extends throughout the alignment. This domain may also comprise smaller homology domains that are shared with other protein families and superfamilies. Although a given protein sequence may contain domains found in several superfamilies, thus indicating a complex evolutionary history, sequences will be assigned to only one homeomorphic superfamily based on the presence of similarity throughout a multiple sequence alignment. The superfamily alignment may also include regions that do not align either within or at the ends of the alignment. In contrast, sequences in the same family align well throughout the alignment.\n;[[Protein tertiary structure|Supersecondary structure]]: a term with similar meaning to a structural motif. Tertiary structure is the three-dimensional or globular structure formed by the packing together or folding of secondary structures of a polypeptide chain.<ref name=\"Mount\"/>\n\n==Secondary structure==\n{{Main|List of protein secondary structure prediction programs}}\n\n'''Secondary structure prediction''' is a set of techniques in [[bioinformatics]] that aim to predict the local [[secondary structure]]s of [[protein]]s based only on knowledge of their [[amino acid]] sequence. For proteins, a prediction consists of assigning regions of the amino acid sequence as likely [[Alpha helix|alpha helices]], [[beta sheet|beta strand]]s (often termed ''extended'' conformations), or [[Turn (biochemistry)|turns]]. The success of a prediction is determined by comparing it to the results of the [[DSSP (algorithm)|DSSP]] algorithm (or similar e.g. [[STRIDE (algorithm)|STRIDE]]) applied to the [[X-ray crystallography|crystal structure]] of the protein. Specialized algorithms have been developed for the detection of specific well-defined patterns such as [[Transmembrane helix|transmembrane helices]] and [[coiled coil]]s in proteins.<ref name=\"Mount\"/>\n\nThe best modern methods of secondary structure prediction in proteins were claimed to reach 80% accuracy after using machine learning and [[sequence alignment]]s;<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Pirovano W, Heringa J |title=Data Mining Techniques for the Life Sciences |chapter=Protein Secondary Structure Prediction |volume=609 |pages=327\u201348 |year=2010 |pmid=20221928 |doi=10.1007/978-1-60327-241-4_19 |isbn=978-1-60327-240-7 |series=Methods in Molecular Biology}}</ref> this high accuracy allows the use of the predictions as feature improving [[fold recognition]] and [[ab initio]] protein structure prediction, classification of [[structural motif]]s, and refinement of [[sequence alignment]]s. The accuracy of current protein secondary structure prediction methods is assessed in weekly [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmarks]] such as [[LiveBench]] and [[EVA (benchmark)|EVA]].\n\n===Background===\nEarly methods of secondary structure prediction, introduced in the 1960s and early 1970s,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Guzzo AV |title=The influence of amino-acid sequence on protein structure |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=809\u201322 |date=November 1965 |pmid=5884309 |pmc=1367904 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(65)86753-4 |bibcode=1965BpJ.....5..809G}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Prothero JW |title=Correlation between the distribution of amino acids and alpha helices |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=367\u201370 |date=May 1966 |pmid=5962284 |pmc=1367951 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(66)86662-6 |bibcode=1966BpJ.....6..367P}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Schiffer M, Edmundson AB |title=Use of helical wheels to represent the structures of proteins and to identify segments with helical potential |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=121\u201335 |date=March 1967 |pmid=6048867 |pmc=1368002 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(67)86579-2 |bibcode=1967BpJ.....7..121S}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Kotelchuck D, Scheraga HA |title=The influence of short-range interactions on protein onformation.

Moreover, the typical secondary structure prediction methods do not account for the influence of [[tertiary structure]] on formation of secondary structure; for example, a sequence predicted as a likely helix may still be able to adopt a beta-strand conformation if it is located within a beta-sheet region of the protein and its side chains pack well with their neighbors. Dramatic conformational changes related to the protein's function or environment can also alter local secondary structure.\n\n===Historical perspective===\nTo date, over 20 different secondary structure prediction methods have been developed. One of the first algorithms was [[Chou\u2013Fasman method]], which relies predominantly on probability parameters determined from relative frequencies of each amino acid's appearance in each type of secondary structure.<ref name=\"Chou\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chou PY, Fasman GD |title=Prediction of protein conformation |journal=Biochemistry |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=222\u201345 |date=January 1974 |pmid=4358940 |doi=10.1021/bi00699a002}}</ref> The original Chou-Fasman parameters, determined from the small sample of structures solved in the mid-1970s, produce poor results compared to modern methods, though the parameterization has been updated since it was first published. The Chou-Fasman method is roughly 50\u201360% accurate in predicting secondary structures.<ref name=\"Mount\"/>\n\nThe next notable program was the [[GOR method]] is an [[information theory]]-based method. It uses the more powerful probabilistic technique of [[Bayesian inference]].<ref name=\"Garnier\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Garnier J, Osguthorpe DJ, Robson B |title=Analysis of the accuracy and implications of simple methods for predicting the secondary structure of globular proteins |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=120 |issue=1 |pages=97\u2013120 |date=March 1978 |pmid=642007 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(78)90297-8}}</ref> The GOR method takes into account not only the probability of each amino acid having a particular secondary structure, but also the [[conditional probability]] of the amino acid assuming each structure given the contributions of its neighbors (it does not assume that the neighbors have that same structure). The approach is both more sensitive and more accurate than that of Chou and Fasman because amino acid structural propensities are only strong for a small number of amino acids such as [[proline]] and [[glycine]]. Weak contributions from each of many neighbors can add up to strong effects overall. The original GOR method was roughly 65% accurate and is dramatically more successful in predicting alpha helices than beta sheets, which it frequently mispredicted as loops or disorganized regions.<ref name=\"Mount\"/>\n\nAnother big step forward, was using [[machine learning]] methods. First [[artificial neural network]]s methods were used. As a training sets they use solved structures to identify common sequence motifs associated with particular arrangements of secondary structures. These methods are over 70% accurate in their predictions, although beta strands are still often underpredicted due to the lack of three-dimensional structural information that would allow assessment of [[hydrogen bonding]] patterns that can promote formation of the extended conformation required for the presence of a complete beta sheet.<ref name=\"Mount\"/> [[Psipred|PSIPRED]] and [[Jpred|JPRED]] are some of the most known programs based on neural networks for protein secondary structure prediction.

The two main problems are the calculation of [[Gibbs free energy|protein free energy]] and [[energy minimization|finding the global minimum]] of this energy. A protein structure prediction method must explore the space of possible protein structures which is [[Levinthal's paradox|astronomically large]]. These problems can be partially bypassed in \"comparative\" or [[homology modeling]] and [[fold recognition]] methods, in which the search space is pruned by the assumption that the protein in question adopts a structure that is close to the experimentally determined structure of another homologous protein. In contrast, the [[de novo protein structure prediction]] methods must explicitly resolve these problems. The progress and challenges in protein structure prediction have been reviewed by Zhang.<ref name=\"zhang2008\"/>\n\n===Before modelling===\nMost tertiary structure modelling methods, such as Rosetta, are optimized for modelling the tertiary structure of single protein domains.

There are many possible procedures that either attempt to mimic [[protein folding]] or apply some [[stochastic]] method to search possible solutions (i.e., [[global optimization]] of a suitable energy function). These procedures tend to require vast computational resources, and have thus only been carried out for tiny proteins. To predict protein structure ''de novo'' for larger proteins will require better algorithms and larger computational resources like those afforded by either powerful supercomputers (such as [[Blue Gene]] or [[MDGRAPE-3]]) or distributed computing (such as [[Folding@home]], the [[Human Proteome Folding Project]] and [[Rosetta@Home]]).

For instance, collagen is folded into a long-extended fiber-like chain and it makes it a fibrous protein. Recently, several techniques have been developed to predict protein folding and thus protein structure, for example, Itasser, and AlphaFold.\n\n===AI methods===\nAlphaFold was one of the first AIs to predict protein structures.
