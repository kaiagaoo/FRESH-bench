It is primarily motivated by the desire to establish biotechnology as a legitimate engineering discipline. When referring to this area of synthetic biology, the word \"bioengineering\" should not be confused with \"traditional genetic engineering\", which involves introducing a single transgene into the intended organism. Bioengineers adapted synthetic biology to provide a substantially more integrated perspective on how to alter organisms or metabolic systems.<ref name=ap1 />\n\nA typical example of single-gene genetic engineering is the insertion of the human insulin gene into bacteria to create transgenic proteins. The creation of whole new signalling pathways, containing numerous genes and regulatory components (such as an oscillator circuit to initiate the periodic production of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in mammalian cells), is known as bioengineering as part of synthetic biology.<ref name=ap1 />\n\nBy utilising simplified and abstracted metabolic and regulatory modules as well as other standardized parts that may be freely combined to create new pathways or creatures, bioengineering aims to create innovative biological systems. In addition to creating infinite opportunities for novel applications, this strategy is anticipated to make bioengineering more predictable and controllable than traditional biotechnology.<ref name=ap1 />\n\n=== Synthetic genomics ===\nThe formation of animals with a chemically manufactured (minimal) genome is another facet of synthetic biology that is highlighted by synthetic genomics. This area of synthetic biology has been made possible by ongoing advancements in DNA synthesis technology, which now makes it feasible to produce DNA molecules with thousands of base pairs at a reasonable cost. The goal is to combine these molecules into complete genomes and transplant them into living cells, replacing the host cell's genome and reprogramming its metabolism to perform different functions.<ref name=ap1 />\n\nScientists have previously demonstrated the potential of this approach by creating infectious viruses by synthesising the genomes of multiple viruses. These significant advances in science and technology triggered the initial public concerns concerning the risks associated with this technology.<ref name=ap1 />\n\nA simple genome might also work as a \"chassis genome\" that could be enlarged quickly by gene inclusion created for particular tasks. Such \"chassis creatures\" would be more suited for the insertion of new functions than wild organisms since they would have fewer biological pathways that could potentially conflict with the new functionalities in addition to having specific insertion sites. Synthetic genomics strives to create creatures with novel \"architectures,\" much like the bioengineering method. It adopts an integrative or holistic perspective of the organism. In this case, the objective is the creation of chassis genomes based on necessary genes and other required DNA sequences rather than the design of metabolic or regulatory pathways based on abstract criteria.<ref name=ap1 />\n\n=== Protocell synthetic biology ===\nThe in vitro generation of synthetic cells is the protocell branch of synthetic biology. Lipid vesicles, which have all the necessary components to function as a complete system, can be used to create these artificial cells. In the end, these synthetic cells should meet the requirements for being deemed alive, namely the capacity for self-replication, self-maintenance, and evolution. The protocell technique has this as its end aim, however there are other intermediary steps that fall short of meeting all the criteria for a living cell. In order to carry out a specific function, these lipid vesicles contain cell extracts or more specific sets of biological macromolecules and complex structures, such as enzymes, nucleic acids, or ribosomes. For instance, liposomes may carry out particular polymerase chain reactions or synthesise a particular protein.<ref name=ap1 />\n\nProtocell synthetic biology takes artificial life one step closer to reality by eventually synthesizing not only the genome but also every component of the cell in vitro, as opposed to the synthetic genomics approach, which relies on coercing a natural cell to carry out the instructions encoded by the introduced synthetic genome. Synthetic biologists in this field view their work as basic study into the conditions necessary for life to exist and its origin more than in any of the other techniques. The protocell technique, however, also lends itself well to applications; similar to other synthetic biology byproducts, protocells could be employed for the manufacture of biopolymers and medicines.<ref name=ap1 />\n\n=== Unconventional molecular biology ===\nThe objective of the \"unnatural molecular biology\" strategy is to create new varieties of life that are based on a different kind of molecular biology, such as new types of nucleic acids or a new genetic code. The creation of new types of nucleotides that can be built into unique nucleic acids could be accomplished by changing certain DNA or RNA constituents, such as the bases or the backbone sugars.<ref name=ap1 />\n\nThe normal genetic code is being altered by inserting quadruplet codons or changing some codons to encode new amino acids, which would subsequently permit the use of non-natural amino acids with unique features in protein production. It is a scientific and technological problem to adjust the enzymatic machinery of the cell for both approaches.<ref name=ap1 />\n\nA new sort of life would be formed by organisms with a genome built on synthetic nucleic acids or on a totally new coding system for synthetic amino acids. This new style of life would have some benefits but also some new dangers. On release into the environment, there would be no horizontal gene transfer or outcrossing of genes with natural species. Furthermore, these kinds of synthetic organisms might be created to require non-natural materials for protein or nucleic acid synthesis, rendering them unable to thrive in the wild if they accidentally escaped.<ref name=ap1 />\n\nOn the other hand, if these organisms ultimately were able to survive outside of controlled space, they might have a particular benefit over natural organisms because they would be resistant to predatory living organisms or natural viruses, that could lead to an unmanaged spread of the synthetic organisms.<ref name=ap1 />\n\n=== ''In silico'' technique ===\nSynthetic biology ''[[in silico]]'' and the various strategies are interconnected. The development of complex designs, whether they are metabolic pathways, fundamental cellular processes, or chassis genomes, is one of the major difficulties faced by the four synthetic-biology methods outlined above. Because of this, synthetic biology has a robust in silico branch, similar to systems biology, that aims to create computational models for the design of common biological components or synthetic circuits, which are essentially simulations of synthetic organisms.<ref name=ap1 />\n\nThe practical application of simulations and models through bioengineering or other fields of synthetic biology is the long-term goal of in silico synthetic biology. Many of the computational simulations of synthetic organisms up to this point possess little to no direct analogy to living things. Due to this, in silico synthetic biology is regarded as a separate group in this article.<ref name=ap1 />\n\nIt is sensible to integrate the five areas under the umbrella of synthetic biology as one unified area of study. Even though they focus on various facets of life, such as metabolic regulation, essential elements, or biochemical makeup, these five strategies all work toward the same end: creating new types of living organisms. Additionally, the varied methodologies begin with numerous methodological approaches, which leads to the diversity of synthetic biology approaches.<ref name=ap1 />\n\nSynthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that draws from and is inspired by many different scientific disciplines, not one single field or technique. Synthetic biologists all have the same underlying objective of designing and producing new forms of life, despite the fact that they may employ various methodologies, techniques, and research instruments. Any evaluation of synthetic biology, whether it examines ethical, legal, or safety considerations, must take into account the fact that while some questions, risks, and issues are unique to each technique, in other circumstances, synthetic biology as a whole must be taken into consideration.<ref name=ap1 />\n\n== Four engineering approaches ==\nSynthetic biology has traditionally been divided into four different engineering approaches: top down, parallel, orthogonal and bottom up.<ref name=cgar>{{Citation |last=Acevedo-Rocha |first=Carlos G. |title=The Synthetic Nature of Biology |date=2016 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-21088-9_2 |work=Ambivalences of Creating Life: Societal and Philosophical Dimensions of Synthetic Biology |series=Ethics of Science and Technology Assessment |volume=45 |pages=9\u201353 |editor-last=Hagen |editor-first=Kristin |place=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-21088-9_2 |isbn=978-3-319-21088-9 |pmc=7123144 |access-date=2023-01-23 |editor2-last=Engelhard |editor2-first=Margret |editor3-last=Toepfer |editor3-first=Georg}}</ref>\n\nTo replicate emergent behaviours from natural biology and build artificial life, unnatural chemicals are used. The other looks for interchangeable components from biological systems to put together and create systems that do not work naturally. In either case, a synthetic objective compels researchers to venture into new area in order to engage and resolve issues that cannot be readily resolved by analysis. Due to this, new paradigms are driven to arise in ways that analysis cannot easily do. In addition to equipments that oscillate, creep, and play tic-tac-toe, synthetic biology has produced diagnostic instruments that enhance the treatment of patients with infectious diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Benner SA, Sismour AM |date=July 2005 |title=Synthetic biology |journal=Nature Reviews.

These initiatives are founded on the hypothesis of a single genesis for cellular life, the so-called [[Last Universal Common Ancestor]], which supports the presence of a universal minimal genome that gave rise to all living things. Recent studies, however, raise the possibility that the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells that make up the tree of life may have evolved from a group of primordial cells rather than from a single cell. As a result, even while the Holy Grail-like pursuit of the \"minimum genome\" has grown elusive, cutting out a number of non-essential functions impairs an organism's fitness and leads to \"fragile\" genomes.<ref name=cgar />\n\n=== Bottom-up approach ===\nThis approach involves creating new biological systems in vitro by bringing together 'non-living' biomolecular components,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwille P |date=September 2011 |title=Bottom-up synthetic biology: engineering in a tinkerer's world |journal=Science |volume=333 |issue=6047 |pages=1252\u20134 |bibcode=2011Sci...333.1252S |doi=10.1126/science.1211701 |pmid=21885774 |s2cid=43354332}}</ref> often with the aim of constructing an [[artificial cell]].\n\nReproduction, replication, and assembly are three crucial self-organizational principles that are taken into account in order to accomplish this. Cells, which are made up of a container and a metabolism, are considered \"hardware\" in the definition of reproduction, whereas replication occurs when a system duplicates a perfect copy of itself, as in the case of DNA, which is considered \"software.\" When vesicles or containers (such as Oparin's coacervates) formed of tiny droplets of molecules that are organic like lipids or liposomes, membrane-like structures comprising phospholipids, aggregate, assembly occur.<ref name=cgar />\n\nThe study of protocells exists along with other in vitro synthetic biology initiatives that seek to produce minimum cells, metabolic pathways, or \"never-born proteins\" as well as to mimic physiological functions including cell division and growth. The in vitro enhancement of synthetic pathways does have the potential to have an effect on some other synthetic biology sectors, including metabolic engineering, despite the fact that it no longer classified as synthetic biology research. This research, which is primarily essential, deserves proper recognition as synthetic biology research.<ref name=cgar />\n\n=== Parallel approach ===\nParallel engineering is also known as bioengineering. The basic genetic code is the foundation for parallel engineering research, which uses conventional biomolecules like nucleic acids and the 20 amino acids to construct biological systems. For a variety of applications in biocomputing, bioenergy, biofuels, bioremediation, optogenetics, and medicine, it involves the standardisation of DNA components, engineering of switches, biosensors, genetic circuits, logic gates, and cellular communication operators. For directing the expression of two or more genes and/or proteins, the majority of these applications often rely on the use of one or more vectors (or plasmids). Small, circular, double-strand DNA units known as plasmids, which are primarily found in prokaryotic but can also occasionally be detected in eukaryotic cells, may replicate autonomously of chromosomal DNA.<ref name=cgar />\n\n=== Orthogonal approach ===\nIt is also known as perpendicular engineering. This strategy, also referred to as \"chemical synthetic biology,\" principally seeks to alter or enlarge the genetic codes of living systems utilising artificial DNA bases and/or amino acids. This subfield is also connected to [[xenobiology]], a newly developed field that combines systems chemistry, synthetic biology, [[exobiology]], and research into the origins of life. In recent decades, researchers have created compounds that are structurally similar to the DNA canonical bases to see if those \"alien\" or xeno (XNA) molecules may be employed as genetic information carriers. Similar to this, noncanonical moieties have taken the place of the DNA sugar ([[deoxyribose]]).<ref name=cgar /> In order to express information other than the 20 conventional amino acids of proteins, the genetic code can be altered or enlarged. One method involves incorporating a specified unnatural, noncanonical, or xeno amino acid (XAA) into one or more proteins at one or more precise places using orthogonal enzymes and a transfer RNA adaptor from an other organism. By using \"directed evolution,\" which entails repeated cycles of gene mutagenesis (genotypic diversity production), screening or selection (of a specific phenotypic trait), and amplification of a better variant for the following iterative round, orthogonal enzymes are produced Numerous XAAs have been effectively incorporated into proteins in more complex creatures like worms and flies as well as in bacteria, yeast, and human cell lines. As a result of canonical DNA sequence changes, directed evolution also enables the development of orthogonal ribosomes, which make it easier to incorporate XAAs into proteins or create \"mirror life,\" or biological systems that contain biomolecules made up of enantiomers with different chiral orientations.<ref name=cgar />\n\n== Enabling technologies ==\nSeveral novel enabling technologies were critical to the success of synthetic biology.

An substitute and potential source of renewable energy is microbes that have had their metabolic pathways altered to be more efficient at converting biomass into biofuels. Only if their production costs could be made to match or even exceed those of present fuel production can these techniques be expected to be successful. Related to this, there are several medicines whose pricey manufacturing procedures prevent them from having a larger therapeutic range.

Several DNA repair processes, including homology-directed recombination and non-homology end joining, can be used to accomplish the desired genome change (i.e., gene deletion or insertion). Additionally, dCas9 (dead Cas9 or nuclease-deficient Cas9), a Cas9 double mutant (H840A, D10A), has been utilised to control gene expression in bacteria or when linked to a stimulation of suppression site in yeast.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Leonard |last2=Chen |first2=Yvonne Y |last3=Gonzalez |first3=Ramon |last4=Peterson |first4=Todd C |last5=Zhao |first5=Huimin |last6=Baltz |first6=Richard H |date=2018-07-01 |title=Synthetic biology advances and applications in the biotechnology industry: a perspective |journal=Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology |language=en |volume=45 |issue=7 |pages=449\u2013461 |doi=10.1007/s10295-018-2056-y |pmid=29915997 |s2cid=49296740 |issn=1476-5535|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n=== Regulatory elements ===\nTo build and develop biological systems, regulating components including regulators, ribosome-binding sites (RBSs), and terminators are crucial.

Currently, the creation of new life forms not present in nature is at small-scale, the potential benefits and dangers remain unknown, and careful consideration and oversight are ensured for most studies.<ref name=\":3\" /> Many advocates express the great potential value\u2014to agriculture, medicine, and academic knowledge, among other fields\u2014of creating artificial life forms. Creation of new entities could expand scientific knowledge well beyond what is currently known from studying natural phenomena. Yet there is concern that artificial life forms may reduce nature's \"purity\" (i.e., nature could be somehow corrupted by human intervention and manipulation) and potentially influence the adoption of more engineering-like principles instead of biodiversity- and nature-focused ideals. Some are also concerned that if an artificial life form were to be released into nature, it could hamper biodiversity by beating out natural species for resources (similar to how [[algal bloom]]s kill marine species). Another concern involves the ethical treatment of newly created entities if they happen to [[nociception|sense pain]], [[sentience]], and self-perception. There is an ongoing debate as to whether such life forms should be granted moral or legal rights, though no consensus exists as to how these rights would be administered or enforced.\n\n=== Ethical support for synthetic biology ===\nEthics and moral rationales that support certain applications of synthetic biology include their potential mitigation of substantial global problems of detrimental environmental impacts of conventional [[environmental impact of agriculture|agriculture]] (including [[environmental impact of meat production|meat production]]), [[animal welfare]], [[food security]], and [[human health]],<ref name=\"Culture, meat, and cultured meat\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bryant CJ | title = Culture, meat, and cultured meat | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 98 | issue = 8 | pages = skaa172 | date = August 2020 | pmid = 32745186 | pmc = 7398566 | doi = 10.1093/jas/skaa172 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hong TK, Shin DM, Choi J, Do JT, Han SG | title = Current Issues and Technical Advances in Cultured Meat Production: A Review | journal = Food Science of Animal Resources | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 355\u2013372 | date = May 2021 | pmid = 34017947 | pmc = 8112310 | doi = 10.5851/kosfa.2021.e14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Treich N | title = Cultured Meat: Promises and Challenges | journal = Environmental & Resource Economics | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 33\u201361 | date = 1 May 2021 | pmid = 33758465 | pmc = 7977488 | doi = 10.1007/s10640-021-00551-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Treich N | title = Cultured Meat: Promises and Challenges | journal = Environmental & Resource Economics | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 33\u201361 | date = May 2021 | pmid = 33758465 | pmc = 7977488 | doi = 10.1007/s10640-021-00551-3 }}</ref> as well as potential reduction of human labor needs and, via therapies of diseases, reduction of human suffering and prolonged life.\n\n=== Biosafety and biocontainment ===\nWhat is most ethically appropriate when considering biosafety measures? How can accidental introduction of synthetic life in the natural environment be avoided? Much ethical consideration and critical thought has been given to these questions. Biosafety not only refers to biological containment; it also refers to strides taken to protect the public from potentially hazardous biological agents. Even though such concerns are important and remain unanswered, not all products of synthetic biology present concern for biological safety or negative consequences for the environment. It is argued that most synthetic technologies are benign and are incapable of flourishing in the outside world due to their \"unnatural\" characteristics as there is yet to be an example of a transgenic microbe conferred with a fitness advantage in the wild.\n\nIn general, existing [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hazard controls]], risk assessment methodologies, and regulations developed for traditional [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs) are considered to be sufficient for synthetic organisms. \"Extrinsic\" [[biocontainment]] methods in a laboratory context include physical containment through [[biosafety cabinet]]s and [[glovebox]]es, as well as [[personal protective equipment]]. In an agricultural context, they include isolation distances and [[pollen]] barriers, similar to methods for [[Biocontainment of genetically modified organisms|biocontainment of GMOs]]. Synthetic organisms may offer increased hazard control because they can be engineered with \"intrinsic\" biocontainment methods that limit their growth in an uncontained environment, or prevent [[horizontal gene transfer]] to natural organisms. Examples of intrinsic biocontainment include [[auxotrophy]], biological [[kill switch]]es, inability of the organism to replicate or to pass modified or synthetic genes to offspring, and the use of [[Xenobiology|xenobiological]] organisms using alternative biochemistry, for example using artificial [[xeno nucleic acid]]s (XNA) instead of DNA.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":32\">{{Cite book |title=Opinion on synthetic biology II: Risk assessment methodologies and safety aspects |date=2016-02-12 |website=EU [[Directorate-General for Health and Consumers]] |doi=10.2772/63529 |publisher=Publications Office |author1=European Commission.
