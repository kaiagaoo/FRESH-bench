Developed by two London psychoanalysts, Joyce Martin and Pauline McCririck, this form of treatment is similar to psycholytic approaches as it is based largely on a psychoanalytic interpretation of abreactions produced by the treatment, but it tends to focus on those experiences in which the patient re-encounters carnal feelings of emotional deprivation and frustration stemming from the infantile needs of their early childhood. As a result, the treatment was developed with the aim to directly fulfill or satisfy those repressed, agonizing cravings for love, physical contact, and other instinctual needs re-lived by the patient. Therefore, the therapist is completely engaged with the subject, as opposed to the traditional detached attitude of the psychoanalyst. With the intense emotional episodes that came with the psychedelic experience, Martin and McCririck aimed to sit in as the \"mother\" role who would enter into close physical contact with the patients by rocking them, giving them milk from a bottle, etc.<ref name=\"GrofLSD\">{{cite book|title=LSD Psychotherapy| vauthors = Grof S |publisher=MAPS|year=2001|isbn=978-0-9660019-4-5|edition=3rd|name-list-style=vanc}}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2022}}\n\n====Hypnodelic therapy====\nHypnodelic therapy, as the name suggests, was developed with the goal to maximize the power of hypnotic suggestion by combining it with the psychedelic experience.
