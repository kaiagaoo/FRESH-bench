It enables two parties to produce a shared [[randomness|random]] secret [[key (cryptography)|key]] known only to them, which then can be used to encrypt and decrypt [[messages]]. The process of quantum key distribution is not to be confused with [[quantum cryptography]], as it is the best-known example of a quantum-cryptographic task.\n\nAn important and unique property of quantum key distribution is the ability of the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain [[information theory|knowledge]] of the key. This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a [[Physical system|quantum system]] in general disturbs the system. A third party trying to eavesdrop on the key must in some way measure it, thus introducing detectable anomalies. By using [[quantum superposition]]s or [[quantum entanglement]] and transmitting information in [[quantum state]]s, a communication system can be implemented that detects eavesdropping. If the level of eavesdropping is below a certain threshold, a key can be produced that is guaranteed to be secure (i.e., the eavesdropper has no information about it). Otherwise no secure key is possible, and communication is aborted.\n\nThe security of encryption that uses quantum key distribution relies on the foundations of quantum mechanics, in contrast to traditional [[public key cryptography]], which relies on the computational difficulty of [[One-way function|certain mathematical functions]], and cannot provide any mathematical proof as to the actual complexity of reversing the one-way functions used. QKD has provable security based on [[information theory]], and [[forward secrecy]].\n\nThe main drawback of quantum-key distribution is that it usually relies on having an [[Message authentication|authenticated classical channel]] of communication.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} In modern cryptography, having an authenticated classical channel means that one already has exchanged either a [[symmetric key]] of sufficient length or public keys of sufficient security level. With such information already available, in practice one can achieve authenticated and sufficiently secure communication without using QKD, such as by using the [[Galois/Counter Mode]] of the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]]. Thus QKD does the work of a [[stream cipher]] at many times the cost.\n\nQuantum key distribution is used to produce and distribute only a key, not to transmit any message data. This key can then be used with any chosen [[encryption algorithm]] to encrypt (and decrypt) a message, which can then be transmitted over a standard [[communication channel]]. The algorithm most commonly associated with QKD is the [[one-time pad]], as it is [[provably secure]] when used with a secret, random key.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Shannon | first=C.

Usually, [[photons]] are used for these quantum states. Quantum key distribution exploits certain properties of these quantum states to ensure its security. There are several different approaches to quantum key distribution, but they can be divided into two main categories depending on which property they exploit.\n\n; Prepare and measure protocols : In contrast to classical physics, the act of measurement is an integral part of quantum mechanics. In general, measuring an unknown quantum state changes that state in some way. This is a consequence of [[quantum indeterminacy]] and can be exploited in order to detect any eavesdropping on communication (which necessarily involves measurement) and, more importantly, to calculate the amount of information that has been intercepted.\n\n; Entanglement based protocols : The quantum states of two (or more) separate objects can become linked together in such a way that they must be described by a combined quantum state, not as individual objects. This is known as [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] and means that, for example, performing a measurement on one object affects the other. If an entangled pair of objects is shared between two parties, anyone intercepting either object alters the overall system, revealing the presence of the third party (and the amount of information they have gained).\n\nThese two approaches can each be further divided into three families of protocols: discrete variable, continuous variable and distributed phase reference coding. Discrete variable protocols were the first to be invented, and they remain the most widely implemented. The other two families are mainly concerned with overcoming practical limitations of experiments. The two protocols described below both use discrete variable coding.\n\n=== BB84 protocol: Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard (1984) ===\n{{Main|BB84}}\nThis protocol, known as [[BB84]] after its inventors and year of publication, was originally described using [[photon polarization]] states to transmit the information.<ref>C. H. Bennett and G. Brassard. Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing. In Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computers, Systems and Signal Processing, volume 175, page 8. New York, 1984.</ref> However, any two pairs of [[Conjugate variables|conjugate]] states can be used for the protocol, and many [[optical fibre|optical-fibre]]-based implementations described as BB84 use phase encoded states. The sender (traditionally referred to as [[Alice and Bob|Alice]]) and the receiver (Bob) are connected by a [[quantum communication channel]] which allows [[quantum states]] to be transmitted. In the case of photons this channel is generally either an optical fibre or simply [[free space]]. In addition they communicate via a public classical channel, for example using broadcast radio or the internet. The protocol is designed with the assumption that an [[eavesdropper]] (referred to as Eve) can interfere in any way with the quantum channel, while the classical channel needs to be [[authenticated]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=A largely self-contained and complete security proof for quantum key distribution |first1=Marco |last1=Tomamichel |first2=Anthony |last2=Leverrier |date=2017 |arxiv=1506.08458 |doi=10.22331/q-2017-07-14-14 |journal=Quantum |volume=1 |pages=14|bibcode=2017Quant...1...14T |s2cid=56465385 }}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |title=Cryptographic security of quantum key distribution |first1=Christopher |last1=Portmann |first2=Renato |last2=Renner |eprint=1409.3525|year=2014 |class=quant-ph }}</ref>\n\nThe security of the protocol comes from encoding the information in [[Orthogonality|non-orthogonal states]]. [[Quantum indeterminacy]] means that these states cannot in general be measured without disturbing the original state (see ''[[No-cloning theorem]]''). BB84 uses two pairs of states, with each pair [[Conjugate variables|conjugate]] to the other pair, and the two states within a pair orthogonal to each other. Pairs of orthogonal states are referred to as a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. The usual polarization state pairs used are either the [[linear polarization|rectilinear basis]] of vertical (0\u00b0) and horizontal (90\u00b0), the [[linear polarization|diagonal basis]] of 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 or the [[circular polarization|circular basis]] of left- and right-handedness. Any two of these bases are conjugate to each other, and so any two can be used in the protocol. Below the rectilinear and diagonal bases are used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:left; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n !

Alice creates a random [[bit]] (0 or 1) and then randomly selects one of her two bases (rectilinear or diagonal in this case) to transmit it in. She then prepares a photon polarization state depending both on the bit value and basis, as shown in the adjacent table. So for example a 0 is encoded in the rectilinear basis (+) as a vertical polarization state, and a 1 is encoded in the diagonal basis (x) as a 135\u00b0 state. Alice then transmits a single photon in the state specified to Bob, using the quantum channel. This process is then repeated from the random bit stage, with Alice recording the state, basis and time of each photon sent.\n\nAccording to quantum mechanics (particularly quantum indeterminacy), no possible measurement distinguishes between the 4 different polarization states, as they are not all orthogonal. The only possible measurement is between any two orthogonal states (an orthonormal basis). So, for example, measuring in the rectilinear basis gives a result of horizontal or vertical. If the photon was created as horizontal or vertical (as a rectilinear [[eigenstate]]) then this measures the correct state, but if it was created as 45\u00b0 or 135\u00b0 (diagonal eigenstates) then the rectilinear measurement instead returns either horizontal or vertical at random. Furthermore, after this measurement the photon is polarized in the state it was measured in (horizontal or vertical), with all information about its initial polarization lost.\n\nAs Bob does not know the basis the photons were encoded in, all he can do is to select a basis at random to measure in, either rectilinear or diagonal. He does this for each photon he receives, recording the time, measurement basis used and measurement result. After Bob has measured all the photons, he communicates with Alice over the public classical channel. Alice broadcasts the basis each photon was sent in, and Bob the basis each was measured in. They both discard photon measurements (bits) where Bob used a different basis, which is half on average, leaving half the bits as a shared key.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:75%; text-align: center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n !

If a third party (usually referred to as Eve, for \"eavesdropper\") has gained any information about the photons' polarization, this introduces errors in Bob's measurements. Other environmental conditions can cause errors in a similar fashion. If more than <math>p</math> bits differ they abort the key and try again, possibly with a different quantum channel, as the security of the key cannot be guaranteed. <math>p</math> is chosen so that if the number of bits known to Eve is less than this, [[privacy amplification]] can be used to reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrarily small amount at the cost of reducing the length of the key.\n\n=== E91 protocol: Artur Ekert (1991) ===\n\n[[Artur Ekert]]'s scheme<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last1=Ekert |first1=Artur K. |title=Quantum cryptography based on Bell's theorem |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=5 August 1991 |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=661\u2013663 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.67.661 |pmid=10044956 |bibcode=1991PhRvL..67..661E |s2cid=27683254 }}</ref> uses entangled pairs of photons. These can be created by Alice, by Bob, or by some source separate from both of them, including eavesdropper Eve. The photons are distributed so that Alice and Bob each end up with one photon from each pair.\n\nThe scheme relies on two properties of entanglement. First, the entangled states are perfectly correlated in the sense that if Alice and Bob both measure whether their particles have vertical or horizontal polarizations, they always get the same answer with 100% probability. The same is true if they both measure any other pair of complementary (orthogonal) polarizations. This necessitates that the two distant parties have exact directionality synchronization. However, the particular results are completely random; it is impossible for Alice to predict if she (and thus Bob) will get vertical polarization or horizontal polarization. Second, any attempt at eavesdropping by Eve destroys these correlations in a way that Alice and Bob can detect.\n\nSimilarly to [[BB84]], the protocol involves a private measurement protocol before detecting the presence of Eve. The measurement stage involves Alice measuring each photon she receives using some basis from the set <math> Z_{0}, Z_{\\frac{\\pi}{8}}, Z_{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}</math> while Bob chooses from  <math> Z_{0}, Z_{\\frac{\\pi}{8}}, Z_{-\\frac{\\pi}{8}}</math> where <math>Z_{\\theta}</math> is the <math>\\{|{\\uparrow}\\rangle, \\; |{\\rightarrow}\\rangle\\}</math> basis rotated by <math>\\theta</math>. They keep their series of basis choices private until measurements are completed. Two groups of photons are made: the first consists of photons measured using the same basis by Alice and Bob while the second contains all other photons. To detect eavesdropping, they can compute the test statistic <math>S</math> using the correlation coefficients between Alice's bases and Bob's similar to that shown in the [[Bell test experiments]]. Maximally entangled photons would result in <math>|S|=2\\sqrt{2}</math>. If this were not the case, then Alice and Bob can conclude Eve has introduced local realism to the system, violating [[Bell's Theorem]]. If the protocol is successful, the first group can be used to generate keys since those photons are completely anti-aligned between Alice and Bob.\n\n=== Device Independent Quantum Key Distribution ===\nIn traditional QKD, the quantum devices used must be perfectly calibrated, trustworthy, and working exactly as they are expected to.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last1=Nadlinger |first1=D.

The pulses are sent along a quantum to Charlie, a third party who can be malicious or not. Charlie uses a beam splitter to overlap the two pulses and perform a measurement. He has two detectors in his own lab, one of which will light up if the bits are equal (00) or (11), and the other when they are different (10, 01). Charlie will announce to Alice and Bob which of the detectors lit up, at which point they publicly reveal the phases ''p'' and ''\u03b3''.<ref name=\":3\" /> This is different from traditional QKD, in which the phases used are never revealed.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Shuang |last2=Yin |first2=Zhen-Qiang |last3=He |first3=De-Yong |last4=Chen |first4=Wei |last5=Wang |first5=Rui-Qiang |last6=Ye |first6=Peng |last7=Zhou |first7=Yao |last8=Fan-Yuan |first8=Guan-Jie |last9=Wang |first9=Fang-Xiang |last10=Chen |first10=Wei |last11=Zhu |first11=Yong-Gang |last12=Morozov |first12=Pavel V. |last13=Divochiy |first13=Alexander V. |last14=Zhou |first14=Zheng |last15=Guo |first15=Guang-Can |date=February 2022 |title=Twin-field quantum key distribution over 830-km fibre |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-021-00928-2 |journal=Nature Photonics |language=en |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=154\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/s41566-021-00928-2 |bibcode=2022NaPho..16..154W |s2cid=117167883 |issn=1749-4893}}</ref>\n\n== Information reconciliation and privacy amplification ==\nThe quantum key distribution protocols described above provide Alice and Bob with nearly identical shared keys, and also with an estimate of the discrepancy between the keys.

A common protocol used for information reconciliation is the '''cascade protocol''', proposed in 1994.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brassard |first1=G. |last2=Salvail |first2=L. |chapter=Secret-key reconciliation by public discussion |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48285-7_35 |doi=10.1007/3-540-48285-7_35 |title=Workshop on the Theory and Application of Cryptographic Techniques |publisher=Springer |date=1993 |isbn=3-540-48285-7 |pages=410\u2013423 }}</ref> This operates in several rounds, with both keys divided into blocks in each round and the [[parity (telecommunication)|parity]] of those blocks compared. If a difference in parity is found then a [[binary search]] is performed to find and correct the error. If an error is found in a block from a previous round that had correct parity then another error must be contained in that block; this error is found and corrected as before. This process is repeated recursively, which is the source of the cascade name. After all blocks have been compared, Alice and Bob both reorder their keys in the same random way, and a new round begins. At the end of multiple rounds Alice and Bob have identical keys with high probability; however, Eve has additional information about the key from the parity information exchanged. However, from a coding theory point of view information reconciliation is essentially source coding with side information. In consequence any coding scheme that works for this problem can be used for information reconciliation.

This partial information could have been gained both by eavesdropping on the quantum channel during key transmission (thus introducing detectable errors), and on the public channel during information reconciliation (where it is assumed Eve gains all possible parity information). Privacy amplification uses Alice and Bob's key to produce a new, shorter key, in such a way that Eve has only negligible information about the new key. This can be done using a [[universal hashing|universal hash function]], chosen at random from a publicly known set of such functions, which takes as its input a binary string of length equal to the key and outputs a binary string of a chosen shorter length. The amount by which this new key is shortened is calculated, based on how much information Eve could have gained about the old key (which is known due to the errors this would introduce), in order to reduce the probability of Eve having any knowledge of the new key to a very low value.\n\n== Implementations ==\n\n=== Experimental ===\nIn 1991, [[John Rarity]], [[Paul Tapster]] and [[Artur Ekert]], researchers from the UK Defence Research Agency in Malvern and Oxford University, demonstrated quantum key distribution protected by the violation of the Bell inequalities.\n\nIn 2008, exchange of secure keys at 1 Mbit/s (over 20&nbsp;km of optical fibre) and 10 kbit/s (over 100&nbsp;km of fibre), was achieved by a collaboration between the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Toshiba]] using the BB84 protocol with [[decoy state]] pulses.<ref>{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0810.1069|last1 = Dixon|first1 = A.R.|title = Gigahertz decoy quantum key distribution with 1 Mbit/s secure key rate|journal = Optics Express|volume = 16|issue = 23|pages = 18790\u20137|author2 = Z.L.

Initially, they excite the ions to an electronic state, which creates an entangled state. This process also creates two photons, which are then captured and transported using an optical fiber, at which point a Bell-basis measurement is performed and the ions are projected to a highly entangled state. Finally the qubits are returned to new locations in the ion traps disconnected from the optical link so that no information can be leaked.

In the BB84 protocol, this produces errors in the key Alice and Bob share. As Eve has no knowledge of the basis a state sent by Alice is encoded in, she can only guess which basis to measure in, in the same way as Bob. If she chooses correctly, she measures the correct photon polarization state as sent by Alice, and resends the correct state to Bob. However, if she chooses incorrectly, the state she measures is random, and the state sent to Bob cannot be the same as the state sent by Alice. If Bob then measures this state in the same basis Alice sent, he too gets a random result\u2014as Eve has sent him a state in the opposite basis\u2014with a 50% chance of an erroneous result (instead of the correct result he would get without the presence of Eve).

In practice many implementations use laser pulses attenuated to a very low level to send the quantum states. These laser pulses contain a very small number of photons, for example 0.2 photons per pulse, which are distributed according to a [[Poisson distribution]]. This means most pulses actually contain no photons (no pulse is sent), some pulses contain 1 photon (which is desired) and a few pulses contain 2 or more photons. If the pulse contains more than one photon, then Eve can split off the extra photons and transmit the remaining single photon to Bob. This is the basis of the photon number splitting attack,<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Brassard | first1=Gilles | last2=L\u00fctkenhaus | first2=Norbert | last3=Mor | first3=Tal | last4=Sanders | first4=Barry C. | title=Limitations on Practical Quantum Cryptography | journal=Physical Review Letters | publisher=American Physical Society (APS) | volume=85 | issue=6 | date=2000-08-07 | issn=0031-9007 | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.85.1330 | pmid=10991544 | pages=1330\u20131333| arxiv=quant-ph/9911054 | bibcode=2000PhRvL..85.1330B | s2cid=18688722 }}</ref> where Eve stores these extra photons in a quantum memory until Bob detects the remaining single photon and Alice reveals the encoding basis. Eve can then measure her photons in the correct basis and obtain information on the key without introducing detectable errors.\n\nEven with the possibility of a PNS attack a secure key can still be generated, as shown in the GLLP security proof;<ref name=\"GLLP\" /> however, a much higher amount of privacy amplification is needed reducing the secure key rate significantly (with PNS the rate scales as <math>t^2</math> as compared to <math>t</math> for a single photon sources, where <math>t</math> is the transmittance of the quantum channel).\n\nThere are several solutions to this problem. The most obvious is to use a true single photon \nsource instead of an attenuated laser. While such sources are still at a developmental stage QKD has been carried out successfully with them.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Intallura | first1=P. M. | last2=Ward | first2=M.

By rejecting the photons that Bob receives and only accepting the ones he doesn't receive, Bob & Alice can set up a secure channel, i.e. Eve's attempts to read the ''counterfactual'' photons would still be detected. This protocol uses the quantum phenomenon whereby the possibility that a photon can be sent has an effect even when it isn't sent. So-called [[interaction-free measurement]] also uses this quantum effect, as for example in the [[Elitzur-Vaidman bomb-testing problem|bomb testing problem]], whereby an experimenter can conceptually determine which bombs are not duds without setting them off, except in a [[counterfactual definiteness|counterfactual]] sense.\n\n== History ==\nQuantum cryptography was proposed first by [[Stephen Wiesner]], then at Columbia University in New York, who, in the early 1970s, introduced the concept of quantum conjugate coding. His seminal paper titled \"Conjugate Coding\" was rejected by IEEE Information Theory but was eventually published in 1983 in SIGACT News (15:1 pp.&nbsp;78\u201388, 1983). In this paper he showed how to store or transmit two messages by encoding them in two \"conjugate observables\", such as linear and circular polarization of light, so that either, but not both, of which may be received and decoded. He illustrated his idea with a design of unforgeable bank notes. A decade later, building upon this work, [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles H. Bennett]], of the IBM [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]], and [[Gilles Brassard]], of the [[University of Montreal]], proposed a method for secure communication based on Wiesner's \"conjugate observables\". In 1990, Artur Ekert, then a PhD student at [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College, University of Oxford]], developed a different approach to quantum key distribution based on quantum entanglement.\n\n== Future ==\nThe current commercial systems are aimed mainly at governments and corporations with high security requirements. Key distribution by courier is typically used in such cases, where traditional key distribution schemes are not believed to offer enough guarantee. This has the advantage of not being intrinsically distance limited, and despite long travel times the transfer rate can be high due to the availability of large capacity portable storage devices. The major difference of quantum key distribution is the ability to detect any interception of the key, whereas with courier the key security cannot be proven or tested. QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) systems also have the advantage of being automatic, with greater reliability and lower operating costs than a secure human courier network.\n\nKak's three-stage protocol has been proposed as a method for secure communication that is entirely quantum unlike quantum key distribution in which the cryptographic transformation uses classical algorithms.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Thapliyal | first1=Kishore | last2=Pathak | first2=Anirban | title=Kak's three-stage protocol of secure quantum communication revisited: hitherto unknown strengths and weaknesses of the protocol | journal=Quantum Information Processing | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=17 | issue=9 | date=2018-07-26 | issn=1570-0755 | doi=10.1007/s11128-018-2001-z | page=229| arxiv=1803.02157 | bibcode=2018QuIP...17..229T | s2cid=52009384 }}</ref>\n\nFactors preventing wide adoption of quantum key distribution outside high security areas include the cost of equipment, and the lack of a demonstrated threat to existing key exchange protocols.

QKD generates keying material for an encryption algorithm that provides confidentiality. Such keying material could also be used in symmetric key cryptographic algorithms to provide integrity and authentication if one has the cryptographic assurance that the original QKD transmission comes from the desired entity (i.e. entity source authentication). QKD does not provide a means to authenticate the QKD transmission source. Therefore, source authentication requires the use of asymmetric cryptography or preplaced keys to provide that authentication. Moreover, the confidentiality services QKD offers can be provided by quantum-resistant cryptography, which is typically less expensive with a better understood risk profile.\n# Quantum key distribution requires special purpose equipment. QKD is based on physical properties, and its security derives from unique physical layer communications. This requires users to lease dedicated fiber connections or physically manage free-space transmitters. It cannot be implemented in software or as a service on a network, and cannot be easily integrated into existing network equipment. Since QKD is hardware-based it also lacks flexibility for upgrades or security patches.\n# Quantum key distribution increases infrastructure costs and insider threat risks. QKD networks frequently necessitate the use of trusted relays, entailing additional cost for secure facilities and additional security risk from insider threats. This eliminates many use cases from consideration.\n# Securing and validating quantum key distribution is a significant challenge. The actual security provided by a QKD system is not the theoretical unconditional security from the laws of physics (as modeled and often suggested), but rather the more limited security that can be achieved by hardware and engineering designs. The tolerance for error in cryptographic security, however, is many orders of magnitude smaller than in most physical engineering scenarios making it very difficult to validate. The specific hardware used to perform QKD can introduce vulnerabilities, resulting in several well-publicized attacks on commercial QKD systems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1= Scarani|first1=Valerio|last2=Kurtsiefer|first2=Christian|date=2014-12-04|title=The black paper of quantum cryptography: Real implementation problems|journal=Theoretical Computer Science |volume=560 |pages=27\u201332 |doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2014.09.015 |s2cid=44504715 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n# Quantum key distribution increases the risk of denial of service. The sensitivity to an eavesdropper as the theoretical basis for QKD security claims also shows that denial of service is a significant risk for QKD.\n\nIn response to problem 1 above, attempts to deliver authentication keys using post-quantum cryptography (or quantum-resistant cryptography) have been proposed worldwide. On the other hand, quantum-resistant cryptography is cryptography belonging to the class of computational security. In 2015, a research result was already published that \"sufficient care must be taken in implementation to achieve information-theoretic security for the system as a whole when authentication keys that are not information-theoretic secure are used\" (when the authentication key is not information-theoretic secure (If the authentication key is not information-theoretically secure, an attacker can break it to bring all classical and quantum communications under control and relay them to launch a [[man-in-the-middle attack]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pacher|first1=Christoph|last2=et|first2=al.|date=January 2016|title=Attacks on quantum key distribution protocols that employ non-ITS authentication|journal=Quantum Information Processing |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=327\u2013362 |doi=10.1007/s11128-015-1160-4 |arxiv=1209.0365 |bibcode=2016QuIP...15..327P |s2cid=7779977 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-015-1160-4}}</ref>\nEricsson, a private company, also cites and points out the above problems and then presents a report that it may not be able to support the [[zero trust security model]], which is a recent trend in network security technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mattsson|first1=J.
