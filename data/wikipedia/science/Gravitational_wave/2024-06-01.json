This curvature is caused by the presence of [[stress\u2013energy tensor|mass]]. Generally, the more mass that is contained within a given volume of space, the greater the curvature of spacetime will be at the boundary of its volume.<ref name=\"HTUW\">{{cite serial |title=[[How the Universe Works#Season 3|How The Universe Works 3]]|episode=First Second of the Big Bang |network=[[Science (TV network)|Discovery Science]] |year=2014}}</ref> As objects with mass move around in spacetime, the curvature changes to reflect the changed locations of those objects. In [[#Sources|certain circumstances]], accelerating objects generate changes in this curvature which propagate outwards at the [[speed of light]] in a wave-like manner. These propagating phenomena are known as gravitational waves.\n\nAs a gravitational wave passes an observer, that observer will find spacetime distorted by the effects of [[Strain (materials science)|strain.]] Distances between objects increase and decrease rhythmically as the wave passes, at a frequency equal to that of the wave. The magnitude of this effect is [[inversely proportional]] to the distance from the source.<ref name=\"Schutz2009\">{{cite book|author=Bernard Schutz|authorlink=Bernard F.

However, due to the astronomical distances to these sources, the effects when measured on Earth are predicted to be very small, having strains of less than 1 part in 10<sup>20</sup>.\n\nWhere General Relativity is accepted, gravitational waves ''as detected'' are attributed to ripples in spacetime; otherwise the gravitational waves can be thought of simply as a product of the orbit of binary systems. (A binary orbit causes the binary system's geometry to change through 180 degrees and also causes the distance between each body of the binary system and the observer to change through 180 degrees causing a gravitational wave frequency of two times the orbital frequency).\n\nScientists continue to demonstrate the existence of these waves with continuously upgraded, highly-sensitive detectors used in joint observation runs.

They allow the observation of the merger of black holes and possibly other exotic objects in the distant Universe. Such systems cannot be observed with more traditional means such as [[optical telescope]]s or [[radio telescope]]s, and so [[gravitational wave astronomy]] gives new insights into the working of the Universe.\n\nIn particular, gravitational waves could be of interest to cosmologists as they offer a possible way of observing the very early Universe.

Very low frequency waves are detected using pulsar timing arrays. Astronomers monitor the timing of approximately 100 pulsars spread widely across our galaxy over the course of years. Detectable changes in the arrival time of their signals can result from passing gravitational waves generated by merging supermassive black holes with wavelengths measured in lightyears. These timing changes can be used to locate the source of the waves.{{cn|date=February 2024}} \n\nUsing this technique, astronomers have discovered the 'hum' of various SMBH mergers occurring in the universe.

He conjectured, like Poincare, that the equation would produce gravitational waves, but, as he mentions in a letter to Schwarzschild in February 1916,<ref name=\"CGShistory\"/> these could not be similar to electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves are produced by dipole motion, requiring both a positive and a negative charge; gravitation has no equivalent to negative charge. Einstein continued to work through the  complexity of the equations of general relativity to find an alternative wave model. The result was published in June 1916,<ref name=\"Gravitationswellen\"/> and there he came to the conclusion that the gravitational wave must propagate with the speed of light, and there must, in fact, be three types of gravitational waves dubbed longitudinal\u2013longitudinal, transverse\u2013longitudinal, and transverse\u2013transverse by [[Hermann Weyl]].<ref name=\"CGShistory\"/>\n\nHowever, the nature of Einstein's approximations led many (including Einstein himself) to doubt the result. In 1922, [[Arthur Eddington]] showed that two of Einstein's types of waves were artifacts of the coordinate system he used, and could be made to propagate at any speed by choosing appropriate coordinates, leading Eddington to jest that they \"propagate at the speed of thought\".<ref name=\"Kennefick2016\">{{cite book|author=Daniel Kennefick|title=Traveling at the Speed of Thought: Einstein and the Quest for Gravitational Waves| date=29 March 2016|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8274-8}}</ref>{{rp|72}} This also cast doubt on the physicality of the third (transverse\u2013transverse) type that Eddington showed always propagate at the [[speed of light]] regardless of coordinate system. In 1936, Einstein and [[Nathan Rosen]] submitted a paper to ''[[Physical Review]]'' in which they claimed gravitational waves could not exist in the full general theory of relativity because any such solution of the field equations would have a singularity. The journal sent their manuscript to be reviewed by [[Howard P. Robertson]], who anonymously reported that the singularities in question were simply the harmless coordinate singularities of the employed cylindrical coordinates. Einstein, who was unfamiliar with the concept of peer review, angrily withdrew the manuscript, never to publish in ''Physical Review'' again. Nonetheless, his assistant [[Leopold Infeld]], who had been in contact with Robertson, convinced Einstein that the criticism was correct, and the paper was rewritten with the opposite conclusion and published elsewhere.<ref name=\"CGShistory\"/><ref name=\"Kennefick2016\"/>{{rp|79ff}} In 1956, [[Felix Pirani]] remedied the confusion caused by the use of various coordinate systems by rephrasing the gravitational waves in terms of the manifestly observable [[Riemann curvature tensor]].<ref>{{Citation\n|author-first=Felix\n|author-last=Pirani\n|author-link =\n|title =On the physical significance of the Riemann tensor\n|trans-title= \n|journal =Acta Physica Polonica\n|volume =15\n|issue=\n|pages =389\u2013405\n|year =1956\n|language =\n|url =\n|doi =\n|bibcode=1956AcPP...15..389P\n|jfm = \n}}\n</ref>\n\nAt the time, Pirani's work was overshadowed by the community's focus on a different question: whether gravitational waves could transmit [[energy]]. This matter was settled by a thought experiment proposed by [[Richard Feynman]] during the first \"GR\" conference at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|Chapel Hill]] in 1957. In short, his argument known as the \"[[sticky bead argument]]\" notes that if one takes a rod with beads then the effect of a passing gravitational wave would be to move the beads along the rod; friction would then produce heat, implying that the passing wave had done [[work (physics)|work]]. Shortly after, [[Hermann Bondi]] published a detailed version of the \"sticky bead argument\".<ref name=\"CGShistory\"/> This later led to a series of articles (1959 to 1989) \nby Bondi and Pirani that established the existence of plane wave solutions for gravitational waves.<ref>David Robinson, Gravitation and general relativity at King's College London, [[European Physical Journal]] H 44, pp 181\u2013270 (2019)</ref>\n\n[[Paul Dirac]] further postulated the existence of gravitational waves, declaring them to have \"physical significance\" in his 1959 lecture at the [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Meetings]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Skuse |first=Ben |date=2022-09-01 |title=Black Holes - Topic {{!}} Lindau Mediatheque |url=https://mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/topics/black-holes |access-date=2023-11-02 |website=Lindau Nobel Mediatheque |language=en}}</ref> Further, it was Dirac who predicted gravitational waves with a well defined energy density in 1964.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Debnath |first=Lokenath |author-link=Lokenath Debnath |date=2013 |title=A short biography of Paul A.

In 1969, Weber claimed to have detected the first gravitational waves, and by 1970 he was \"detecting\" signals regularly from the [[Galactic Center]]; however, the frequency of detection soon raised doubts on the validity of his observations as the implied rate of energy loss of the [[Milky Way]] would drain our galaxy of energy on a timescale much shorter than its inferred age. These doubts were strengthened when, by the mid-1970s, repeated experiments from other groups building their own Weber bars across the globe failed to find any signals, and by the late 1970s consensus was that Weber's results were spurious.<ref name=\"CGShistory\"/>\n\nIn the same period, the first indirect evidence of gravitational waves was discovered.

For example, the waves given off by the cataclysmic final merger of [[GW150914]] reached Earth after travelling over a billion [[light-year]]s, as a ripple in [[spacetime]] that changed the length of a 4&nbsp;km LIGO arm by a thousandth of the width of a [[proton]], proportionally equivalent to changing the distance to the [[Alpha Centauri|nearest star]] outside the Solar System by one hair's width.<ref>LIGO press conference 11 February 2016</ref> This tiny effect from even extreme gravitational waves makes them observable on Earth only with the most sophisticated detectors.\n\nThe effects of a passing gravitational wave, in an extremely exaggerated form, can be visualized by imagining a perfectly flat region of [[spacetime]] with a group of motionless test particles lying in a plane, e.g., the surface of a computer screen. As a gravitational wave passes through the particles along a line perpendicular to the plane of the particles, i.e., following the observer's line of vision into the screen, the particles will follow the distortion in spacetime, oscillating in a \"[[cruciform]]\" manner, as shown in the animations. The area enclosed by the test particles does not change and there is no motion along the direction of propagation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe oscillations depicted in the animation are exaggerated for the purpose of discussion{{snd}} in reality a gravitational wave has a very small [[amplitude]] (as formulated in [[linearized gravity]]). However, they help illustrate the kind of oscillations associated with gravitational waves as produced by a pair of masses in a [[circular orbit]]. In this case the amplitude of the gravitational wave is constant, but its plane of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] changes or rotates at twice the orbital rate, so the time-varying gravitational wave size, or 'periodic spacetime strain', exhibits a variation as shown in the animation.<ref name = \"LL75\">{{cite book |last1=Landau |first1=L.

The amplitude shown here is roughly ''h''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5 (or 50%). Gravitational waves passing through the Earth are many [[sextillion]] times weaker than this{{snd}} ''h''&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;10<sup>\u221220</sup>.\n* [[Frequency]]: Usually denoted ''f'', this is the frequency with which the wave oscillates (1 divided by the amount of time between two successive maximum stretches or squeezes)\n* [[Wavelength]]: Usually denoted ''\u03bb'', this is the distance along the wave between points of maximum stretch or squeeze.\n* [[Speed]]: This is the speed at which a point on the wave (for example, a point of maximum stretch or squeeze) travels. For gravitational waves with small amplitudes, this [[speed of gravity|wave speed]] is equal to the [[speed of light]] (''c'').\n\nThe speed, wavelength, and frequency of a gravitational wave are related by the equation {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''\u03bbf''}}, just like the equation for a [[Electromagnetic radiation#Wave model|light wave]]. For example, the animations shown here oscillate roughly once every two seconds. This would correspond to a frequency of 0.5&nbsp;Hz, and a wavelength of about 600&nbsp;000&nbsp;km, or 47 times the diameter of the Earth.\n\nIn the above example, it is assumed that the wave is [[linear polarization|linearly polarized]] with a \"plus\" polarization, written ''h''<sub>+</sub>. Polarization of a gravitational wave is just like polarization of a light wave except that the polarizations of a gravitational wave are 45&nbsp;degrees apart, as opposed to 90&nbsp;degrees.<ref>{{citation|title=THE SCIENCE AND DETECTION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES; section: \"Introduction, page 1\"| url=https://labcit.ligo.caltech.edu/~BCBAct/talks00/Alberta/LakeLouisepaper.PDF| access-date=8 October 2022}}</ref> In particular, in a \"cross\"-polarized gravitational wave, ''h''<sub>\u00d7</sub>, the effect on the test particles would be basically the same, but rotated by 45 degrees, as shown in the second animation. Just as with light polarization, the polarizations of gravitational waves may also be expressed in terms of [[circular polarization|circularly polarized]] waves. Gravitational waves are polarized because of the nature of their source.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:The Gravitational wave spectrum Sources and Detectors.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|The gravitational wave spectrum with sources and detectors. ''Credit: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center''<ref>{{cite web|title=Gravitational Astrophysics Laboratory|url=http://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/663/research/index.html|website=science.gsfc/nasa.gov|access-date=20 September 2016}}</ref>]]\nIn general terms, gravitational waves are radiated by objects whose motion involves acceleration and its change, provided that the motion is not perfectly spherically [[symmetric]] (like an expanding or contracting sphere) or rotationally symmetric (like a spinning disk or sphere). A simple example of this principle is a spinning [[dumbbell]]. If the dumbbell spins around its axis of symmetry, it will not radiate gravitational waves; if it tumbles end over end, as in the case of two planets orbiting each other, it will radiate gravitational waves. The heavier the dumbbell, and the faster it tumbles, the greater is the gravitational radiation it will give off. In an extreme case, such as when the two weights of the dumbbell are massive stars like neutron stars or black holes, orbiting each other quickly, then significant amounts of gravitational radiation would be given off.\n\nSome more detailed examples:\n* Two objects orbiting each other, as a planet would orbit the Sun, ''will'' radiate.\n* A spinning non-axisymmetric planetoid{{snd}} say with a large bump or dimple on the equator{{snd}} ''will'' radiate.\n* A [[supernova]] ''will'' radiate except in the unlikely event that the explosion is perfectly symmetric.\n* An isolated non-spinning solid object moving at a constant velocity ''will not'' radiate. This can be regarded as a consequence of the principle of [[Law of conservation of linear momentum|conservation of linear momentum]].\n* A spinning disk ''will not'' radiate. This can be regarded as a consequence of the principle of [[conservation of angular momentum]]. However, it ''will'' show [[Gravitoelectromagnetism|gravitomagnetic]] effects.\n* A spherically pulsating spherical star (non-zero monopole moment or [[mass]], but zero quadrupole moment) ''will not'' radiate, in agreement with [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]].\n\nMore technically, the second time derivative of the [[quadrupole|quadrupole moment]] (or the ''l''-th time derivative of the ''l''-th [[multipole expansion|multipole moment]]) of an isolated system's [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] must be non-zero in order for it to emit gravitational radiation. This is analogous to the changing dipole moment of charge or current that is necessary for the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]].\n\n===Binaries===\n{{See also|Two-body problem in general relativity}}\n[[File:orbit2.gif|thumb|Two stars of dissimilar mass are in [[circular orbits]].

However, such an orbit represents a changing [[Quadrupole#Gravitational quadrupole|quadrupole moment]]. That is, the system will give off gravitational waves.\n\nIn theory, the loss of energy through gravitational radiation could eventually drop the Earth into the [[Sun]]. However, the total energy of the Earth orbiting the Sun ([[kinetic energy]] + [[gravitational potential energy]]) is about 1.14{{e|36}} [[joules]] of which only 200 [[watt]]s (joules per second) is lost through gravitational radiation, leading to a [[orbital decay|decay in the orbit]] by about 1{{e|-15}} meters per day or roughly the diameter of a [[proton]]. At this rate, it would take the Earth approximately 3{{e|13}} times more than the current [[age of the universe]] to spiral onto the Sun.

For example, a pair of [[solar mass]] neutron stars in a circular orbit at a separation of 1.89{{e|8}} m (189,000&nbsp;km) has an orbital period of 1,000 seconds, and an expected lifetime of 1.30{{e|13}} seconds or about 414,000 years. Such a system could be observed by [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna|LISA]] if it were not too far away. A far greater number of white dwarf binaries exist with orbital periods in this range. White dwarf binaries have [[Solar mass|masses in the order of the Sun]], and diameters in the order of the Earth. They cannot get much closer together than 10,000&nbsp;km before they will [[Stellar collision|merge]] and explode in a [[Type Ia supernova#Double degenerate progenitors|supernova]] which would also end the emission of gravitational waves. Until then, their gravitational radiation would be comparable to that of a neutron star binary.\n\n[[File:Artist\u2019s impression of merging neutron stars.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of merging neutron stars, a source of gravitational waves<ref>{{cite web|title=ESO Telescopes Observe First Light from Gravitational Wave Source \u2013 Merging neutron stars scatter gold and platinum into space|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1733/|website=www.eso.org|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>]]\nWhen the orbit of a neutron star binary has decayed to 1.89{{e|6}} m (1890&nbsp;km), its remaining lifetime is about 130,000 seconds or 36 hours. The orbital frequency will vary from 1 orbit per second at the start, to 918 orbits per second when the orbit has shrunk to 20&nbsp;km at merger. The majority of gravitational radiation emitted will be at twice the orbital frequency. Just before merger, the inspiral could be observed by LIGO if such a binary were close enough. LIGO has only a few minutes to observe this merger out of a total orbital lifetime that may have been billions of years. In August 2017, LIGO and Virgo observed the first binary neutron star inspiral in [[GW170817]], and 70 observatories collaborated to detect the electromagnetic counterpart, a [[kilonova]] in the galaxy [[NGC 4993]], 40 [[megaparsec]]s away, emitting a short [[gamma ray burst]] ([[GRB 170817A]]) seconds after the merger, followed by a longer optical transient ([[AT 2017gfo]]) powered by [[r-process]] nuclei. Advanced LIGO detectors should be able to detect such events up to 200 megaparsecs away. Within this range of the order 40 events are expected per year.<ref>{{citation|title=LIGO Scientific Collaboration \u2013 FAQ; section: \"Do we expect LIGO's advanced detectors to make a discovery, then?\" and \"What's so different about LIGO's advanced detectors?\"| url=http://ligo.org/science/faq.php| access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Black hole binaries===\n{{Main|Binary black hole}}\nBlack hole binaries emit gravitational waves during their in-spiral, [[Stellar collision|merger]], and ring-down phases.

This explosion can happen in one of many ways, but in all of them a significant proportion of the matter in the star is blown away into the surrounding space at extremely high velocities (up to 10% of the speed of light). Unless there is perfect spherical symmetry in these explosions (i.e., unless matter is spewed out evenly in all directions), there will be gravitational radiation from the explosion. This is because gravitational waves are [[Quadrupole formula|generated by a changing quadrupole moment]], which can happen only when there is asymmetrical movement of masses. Since the exact mechanism by which supernovae take place is not fully understood, it is not easy to model the gravitational radiation emitted by them.\n\n===Spinning neutron stars===\nAs noted above, a mass distribution will emit gravitational radiation only when there is spherically asymmetric motion among the masses. A [[Pulsar|spinning neutron star]] will generally emit no gravitational radiation because neutron stars are highly dense objects with a strong gravitational field that keeps them almost perfectly spherical. In some cases, however, there might be slight deformities on the surface called \"mountains\", which are bumps extending no more than 10 centimeters (4 inches) above the surface,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/6682-neutron-star-crust-stronger-steel.html|title=Neutron Star Crust Is Stronger than Steel|website=[[Space.com]]|date=18 May 2009|access-date=2016-07-01}}</ref> that make the spinning spherically asymmetric. This gives the star a quadrupole moment that changes with time, and it will emit gravitational waves until the deformities are smoothed out.\n\n===Inflation===\n{{Main|inflation (cosmology)}}\nMany models of the Universe suggest that there was an inflationary epoch in the early history of the Universe when space expanded by a large factor in a very short amount of time. If this expansion was not symmetric in all directions, it may have emitted gravitational radiation detectable today as a [[gravitational wave background]].

However the graviton is not yet proven to exist, and no [[scientific model]] yet exists that successfully reconciles [[general relativity]], which describes gravity, and the [[Standard Model]], which describes all other [[fundamental forces]]. Attempts, such as [[quantum gravity]], have been made, but are not yet accepted.\n\nIf such a particle exists, it is expected to be [[Mass in special relativity|massless]] (because the gravitational force appears to have unlimited range) and must be a [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-2 [[boson]]. It can be shown that any massless spin-2 field would give rise to a force indistinguishable from gravitation, because a massless spin-2 field must couple to (interact with) the stress\u2013energy tensor in the same way that the gravitational field does; therefore if a massless spin-2 particle were ever discovered, it would be likely to be the graviton without further distinction from other massless spin-2 particles.<ref>For a comparison of the geometric derivation and the (non-geometric) spin-2 field derivation of general relativity, refer to box 18.1 (and also 17.2.5) of {{cite book\n | last1=Misner | first1=C.

In particular, gravitational waves are expected to be unaffected by the opacity of the very early universe. In these early phases, space had not yet become \"transparent\", so observations based upon light, radio waves, and other electromagnetic radiation that far back into time are limited or unavailable. Therefore, gravitational waves are expected in principle to have the potential to provide a wealth of observational data about the very early universe.<ref name=\"Black Holes, Cosmic Collisions and the Rippling of Spacetime\" />\n\n===Determining direction of travel===\nThe difficulty in directly detecting gravitational waves means it is also difficult for a single detector to identify by itself the direction of a source.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO SAY IT'S \"IMPOSSIBLE\": IN PRINCIPLE A 3D OBSERVATORY IN SPACE OR A NEW DESIGN OF DETECTOR COULD DETERMINE DIRECTION UNAIDED.--> Therefore, multiple detectors are used, both to distinguish signals from other \"noise\" by confirming the signal is not of earthly origin, and also to determine direction by means of [[triangulation]]. This technique uses the fact that the waves travel at the [[speed of light]] and will reach different detectors at different times depending on their source direction. Although the differences in arrival time may be just a few [[millisecond]]s, this is sufficient to identify the direction of the origin of the wave with considerable precision.\n\nOnly in the case of [[GW170814]] were three detectors operating at the time of the event, therefore, the direction is precisely defined. The detection by all three instruments led to a very accurate estimate of the position of the source, with a 90% credible region of just 60 [[square degree|deg<sup>2</sup>]], a factor 20 more accurate than before.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR6d8V5oh0o Update on Gravitational Wave Science from the LIGO-Virgo Scientific Collaborations] (Video of the press conference), retrieved 27 September 2017</ref>\n\n==Gravitational wave astronomy==\n\n[[File:wavy.gif|upright=1.35|thumb|Two-dimensional representation of gravitational waves generated by two [[neutron star]]s orbiting each other.]]\n{{Main| Gravitational-wave astronomy}}\n\nDuring the past century, [[astronomy]] has been revolutionized by the use of new methods for observing the universe. Astronomical observations were initially made using [[visible light]]. [[Galileo Galilei]] pioneered the use of telescopes to enhance these observations. However, visible light is only a small portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and not all objects in the distant universe shine strongly in this particular band. More information may be found, for example, in radio wavelengths. Using [[radio telescopes]], astronomers have discovered [[pulsars]] and [[quasars]], for example. Observations in the [[microwave]] band led to the detection of [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|faint imprints]] of the [[Big Bang]], a discovery [[Stephen Hawking]] called the \"greatest discovery of the century, if not all time\". Similar advances in observations using [[gamma ray]]s, [[x-ray]]s, [[ultraviolet light]], and [[infrared light]] have also brought new insights to astronomy. As each of these regions of the spectrum has opened, new discoveries have been made that could not have been made otherwise. The astronomy community hopes that the same holds true of gravitational waves.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gough|first1=Evan|title=Gravitational Waves Discovered: A New Window on the Universe|url=https://www.universetoday.com/127351/gravitational-waves-discovered-a-new-window-on-the-universe/|website=Universe Today|access-date=30 March 2021|date=11 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=Christopher|title=Listening to the gravitational universe: what can't we see?|url=http://unibirmingham.tumblr.com/post/118939268978/listening-to-the-gravitational-universe-what|website=University of Birmingham|publisher=[[University of Birmingham]]|access-date=29 November 2015|date=14 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nGravitational waves have two important and unique properties. First, there is no need for any type of matter to be present nearby in order for the waves to be generated by a binary system of uncharged black holes, which would emit no electromagnetic radiation. Second, gravitational waves can pass through any intervening matter without being scattered significantly. Whereas light from distant stars may be blocked out by [[interstellar dust]], for example, gravitational waves will pass through essentially unimpeded.

Each of the stars is about {{Solar mass|1.4}} and the size of their orbits is about 1/75 of the [[Earth's orbit|Earth\u2013Sun orbit]], just a few times larger than the diameter of our own Sun. The combination of greater masses and smaller separation means that the energy given off by the Hulse\u2013Taylor binary will be far greater than the energy given off by the Earth\u2013Sun system{{snd}} roughly 10<sup>22</sup> times as much.\n\nThe information about the orbit can be used to predict how much energy (and angular momentum) would be radiated in the form of gravitational waves. As the binary system loses energy, the stars gradually draw closer to each other, and the orbital period decreases.  The resulting trajectory of each star is an inspiral, a spiral with decreasing radius.  General relativity precisely describes these trajectories; in particular, the energy radiated in gravitational waves determines the rate of decrease in the period, defined as the time interval between successive periastrons (points of closest approach of the two stars).  For the Hulse\u2013Taylor pulsar, the predicted current change in radius is about 3&nbsp;mm per orbit, and the change in the 7.75 hr period is about 2 seconds per year.

After years of development the first ground-based interferometers became operational in 2015. Currently, the most sensitive is [[LIGO]]{{snd}} the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. LIGO has three detectors: one in [[Livingston, Louisiana]], one at the [[Hanford site]] in [[Richland, Washington]] and a third (formerly installed as a second detector at Hanford) that is planned to be moved to [[INDIGO|India]]. Each observatory has two [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer|light storage arms]] that are 4&nbsp;kilometers in length. These are at 90&nbsp;degree angles to each other, with the light passing through 1&nbsp;m diameter vacuum tubes running the entire 4&nbsp;kilometers. A passing gravitational wave will slightly stretch one arm as it shortens the other. This is the motion to which an interferometer is most sensitive.\n\nEven with such long arms, the strongest gravitational waves will only change the distance between the ends of the arms by at most roughly 10<sup>\u221218</sup>&nbsp;m. LIGO should be able to detect gravitational waves as small as ''h'' ~ {{val|5|e=-22}}. Upgrades to LIGO and [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] should increase the sensitivity still further. Another highly sensitive interferometer, [[KAGRA]], which is located in the [[Kamioka Observatory]] in Japan, is in operation since February 2020. A key point is that a tenfold increase in sensitivity (radius of 'reach') increases the volume of space accessible to the instrument by one thousand times. This increases the rate at which detectable signals might be seen from one per tens of years of observation, to tens per year.<ref name=Abadie2010>{{cite journal |author1 = LIGO Scientific Collaboration |author2 = Virgo Collaboration |title = Predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors |journal = Classical and Quantum Gravity |volume = 27 |issue = 17 |page = 17300 |arxiv = 1003.2480 |bibcode = 2010CQGra..27q3001A |doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/27/17/173001 |year = 2010 |s2cid = 15200690 }}</ref>\n\nInterferometric detectors are limited at high frequencies by [[shot noise]], which occurs because the lasers produce photons randomly; one analogy is to rainfall{{snd}} the rate of rainfall, like the laser intensity, is measurable, but the raindrops, like photons, fall at random times, causing fluctuations around the average value. This leads to noise at the output of the detector, much like radio static. In addition, for sufficiently high laser power, the random momentum transferred to the test masses by the laser photons shakes the mirrors, masking signals of low frequencies. Thermal noise (e.g., [[Brownian motion]]) is another limit to sensitivity. In addition to these 'stationary' (constant) noise sources, all ground-based detectors are also limited at low frequencies by [[seismic]] noise and other forms of environmental vibration, and other 'non-stationary' noise sources; creaks in mechanical structures, lightning or other large electrical disturbances, etc. may also create noise masking an event or may even imitate an event. All of these must be taken into account and excluded by analysis before detection may be considered a true gravitational wave event.\n\n====Einstein@Home====\n{{Main|Einstein@Home}}\nThe simplest gravitational waves are those with constant frequency. The waves given off by a spinning, non-axisymmetric neutron star would be approximately [[monochrome|monochromatic]]: a [[pure tone]] in [[acoustics]]. Unlike signals from supernovae or binary black holes, these signals evolve little in amplitude or frequency over the period it would be observed by ground-based detectors. However, there would be some change in the measured signal, because of [[Doppler shift]]ing caused by the motion of the Earth. Despite the signals being simple, detection is extremely computationally expensive, because of the long stretches of data that must be analysed.\n\nThe [[Einstein@Home]] project is a [[distributed computing]] project similar to [[SETI@home]] intended to detect this type of gravitational wave. By taking data from LIGO and GEO, and sending it out in little pieces to thousands of volunteers for parallel analysis on their home computers, Einstein@Home can sift through the data far more quickly than would be possible otherwise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://einstein.phys.uwm.edu/|title=Einstein@Home}}</ref>\n\n===Space-based interferometers===\nSpace-based interferometers, such as [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna|LISA]] and [[DECIGO]], are also being developed. LISA's design calls for three test masses forming an equilateral triangle, with lasers from each spacecraft to each other spacecraft forming two independent interferometers. LISA is planned to occupy a solar orbit trailing the Earth, with each arm of the triangle being five million kilometers. This puts the detector in an excellent vacuum far from Earth-based sources of noise, though it will still be susceptible to heat, [[shot noise]], and artifacts caused by [[cosmic ray]]s and [[solar wind]].\n\n===Using pulsar timing arrays===\n{{main|Pulsar timing array}}\n[[File:correlation_vs_angular_separation_between_pulsars.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Plot of correlation between pulsars observed by NANOGrav vs angular separation between pulsars, compared with a theoretical ''Hellings-Downs'' model (dashed purple) and if there were no gravitational wave background (solid green)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://iopscience.iop.org/collections/apjl-230623-245-Focus-on-NANOGrav-15-year | title=IOPscience - Focus on NANOGrav's 15 yr Data Set and the Gravitational Wave Background }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2023/06/28/after-15-years-pulsar-timing-yields-evidence-of-cosmic-gravitational-wave-background | title=After 15 years, pulsar timing yields evidence of cosmic gravitational wave background | date=2022 }}</ref>]]\n\n[[Pulsar]]s are rapidly rotating stars. A pulsar emits beams of radio waves that, like lighthouse beams, sweep through the sky as the pulsar rotates. The signal from a pulsar can be detected by radio telescopes as a series of regularly spaced pulses, essentially like the ticks of a clock. GWs affect the time it takes the pulses to travel from the pulsar to a telescope on Earth. A [[pulsar timing array]] uses [[millisecond pulsar]]s to seek out perturbations due to GWs in measurements of the time of arrival of pulses to a telescope, in other words, to look for deviations in the clock ticks. To detect GWs, pulsar timing arrays search for a distinct quadrupolar pattern of correlation and anti-correlation between the time of arrival of pulses from different pulsar pairs as a function of their angular separation in the sky.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n | author=Hellings, R.W.\n | author2=Downs, G.S.\n | date=1983\n | title=Upper limits on the isotropic gravitational radiation background from pulsar timing analysis\n | journal=[[Astrophysical Journal Letters]]\n | volume=265 | pages=L39\u2013L42 | bibcode = 1983ApJ...265L..39H\n|doi = 10.1086/183954 | doi-access=free\n }}</ref> Although pulsar pulses travel through space for hundreds or thousands of years to reach us, pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to perturbations in their travel time of much less than a millionth of a second.\n\nThe most likely source of GWs to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive are supermassive black hole binaries, which form from the collision of galaxies.<ref>\n{{Cite journal \n  |vauthors=Arzoumanian Z, et al.\n  |collaboration=NANOGrav Collaboration\n  |arxiv=1801.02617\n  |title=The NANOGrav 11-year Data Set: Pulsar-timing Constraints On The Stochastic Gravitational-wave Background\n  |journal=The Astrophysical Journal\n  |volume=859\n  |issue=1\n  |pages=47\n  |doi=10.3847/1538-4357/aabd3b\n  |year=2018\n  |bibcode=2018ApJ...859...47A\n  |s2cid=89615050\n |doi-access=free\n }}</ref>  In addition to individual binary systems, pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to a stochastic background of GWs made from the sum of GWs from many galaxy mergers.

The observation of the [[GW170817]] transient, which occurred on 17 August 2017, allowed for constraining the masses of the neutron stars involved between 0.86 and 2.26 solar masses. Further analysis allowed a greater restriction of the mass values to the interval 1.17\u20131.60 solar masses, with the total system mass measured to be 2.73\u20132.78 solar masses. The inclusion of the Virgo detector in the observation effort allowed for an improvement of the localization of the source by a factor of 10. This in turn facilitated the electromagnetic follow-up of the event. In contrast to the case of binary black hole mergers, binary neutron star mergers were expected to yield an electromagnetic counterpart, that is, a light signal associated with the event. A gamma-ray burst ([[GRB 170817A]]) was detected by the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], occurring 1.7 seconds after the gravitational wave transient. The signal, originating near the galaxy [[NGC 4993]], was associated with the neutron star merger. This was corroborated by the electromagnetic follow-up of the event ([[AT 2017gfo]]), involving 70 telescopes and observatories and yielding observations over a large region of the electromagnetic spectrum which further confirmed the neutron star nature of the merged objects and the associated [[kilonova]].<ref name=\"PhysRev119\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Abbott BP, et al |collaboration=[[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]] & [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo Collaboration]]|title=GW170817: Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Neutron Star Inspiral|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=16 October 2017|volume=119|issue=16|pages=161101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101|pmid=29099225|arxiv=1710.05832|bibcode=2017PhRvL.119p1101A|s2cid=217163611 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-gw170817|title=GW170817 Press Release|website=LIGO Lab {{!}} Caltech|access-date=2017-10-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 2021, the detection of the first two neutron star-black hole binaries by the LIGO and VIRGO detectors was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, allowing to first set bounds on the quantity of such systems.
