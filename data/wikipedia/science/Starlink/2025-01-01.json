The ''Journal'' reported that Putin had asked Musk to avoid activating his Starlink satellite system over [[Taiwan]], to appease [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|Chinese Communist Party general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]].

One person said no alerts were raised by the U.S. government, noting the dilemma of the government being dependent on Musk's technologies. Musk initially voiced support for Ukraine's defense against Russia's 2022 invasion by donating Starlink terminals, but made later decisions to limit Ukrainian access to Starlink, which coincided with Russian pressure in public and in private.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Grove |first1=Thomas |last2=Strobel |first2=Warren P. |last3=Viswanatha |first3=Aruna |last4=Lubold |first4=Gordon |last5=Schechner |first5=Sam |date=October 24, 2024 |title=Elon Musk's Secret Conversations With Vladimir Putin |url=https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187?mod=hp_lead_pos1 |url-access=subscription |access-date=October 25, 2024 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref> In a November 2024 call with President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy], Musk said he will continue supporting Ukraine through Starlink.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ravid |first1=Barak |title=Scoop: Elon Musk joined Trump's call with Zelensky |url=https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call |access-date=8 November 2024 |date=8 November 2024}}</ref>\n\nSpaceX has asked its numerous Taiwanese suppliers to move production abroad citing [[geopolitical risk]] concerns.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Guarascio |first1=Francesco |last2=Vu |first2=Khanh |last3=Blanchard |first3=Ben |title=After SpaceX's requests, Taiwanese suppliers move manufacturing abroad, sources say |url=https://www.reuters.com/technology/after-spacexs-requests-taiwanese-suppliers-move-manufacturing-abroad-sources-say-2024-11-05/ |website=reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |access-date=7 November 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Irwin |first1=Kate |title=SpaceX Asked Starlink Suppliers to Leave Taiwan Amid Tensions With China |url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-asked-starlink-suppliers-to-leave-taiwan |website=pcmag.com |publisher=PC Magazine |access-date=7 November 2024}}</ref> This move was questioned by the Taiwanese government and resulted in significant anger from the Taiwanese public with citizens pointing out that Starlink was unavailable in Taiwan despite its suppliers underlying the technology and others calling for a boycott of Tesla products.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Davidson |first1=Helen |title=Anger in Taiwan over reports SpaceX asked suppliers to move abroad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/space-x-taiwan-manufacturing-claims-elon-musk |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=7 November 2024}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2024, SpaceX proposed a constellation of Starlink satellites around Mars, referred to as \"Marslink.\" The proposed system would be capable of providing more than 4\u00a0Mbit/s of bandwidth between Earth and Mars as well as imaging services.<ref name=\"pcmag20241107\">{{cite news |last1=Kan |first1=Michael |title=SpaceX Pitches NASA on 'Marslink,' a Version of Starlink for the Red Planet |url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-pitches-nasa-on-marslink-a-version-of-starlink-for-the-red-planet |access-date=8 November 2024 |date=7 November 2024}}</ref>\n\nStarting in July 2024, SpaceX began conducting tests on Starlink in cooperation with the Romanian [[Ministry of National Defence (Romania)|Ministry of National Defense]] and National Authority for Communications Administration and Regulation (ANCOM).
