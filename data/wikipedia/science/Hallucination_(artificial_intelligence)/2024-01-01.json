AI training to produce diverse responses can also lead to hallucination. Hallucinations can also occur when the AI is trained on a dataset wherein labeled summaries, despite being factually accurate, are not directly grounded in the labeled data purportedly being \"summarized\". Larger datasets can create a problem of parametric knowledge (knowledge that is hard-wired in learned system parameters), creating hallucinations if the system is overconfident in its hardwired knowledge. In systems such as [[GPT-3]], an AI generates each next word based on a sequence of previous words (including the words it has itself previously generated during the same conversation), causing a cascade of possible hallucination as the response grows longer.<ref name=\"axiv\" /> By 2022, papers such as the ''[[New York Times]]'' expressed concern that, as adoption of bots based on [[large language models]] continued to grow, unwarranted user confidence in bot output could lead to problems.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Metz |first1=Cade |title=The New Chatbots Could Change the World.

In that case, it derives from the way the model is trained. A lot of reasons can contribute to this type of hallucination, such as: \n** An erroneous decoding from the [[Transformer (machine learning model)|transformer]]\n** A bias from the historical sequences that the model previously generated\n** A bias generated from the way the model encodes its knowledge in its parameters\n\n===ChatGPT===\n[[OpenAI]]'s [[ChatGPT]], released in beta-version to the public on November 30, 2022, is based on the [[foundation model]] GPT-3.5 (a revision of [[GPT-3]]).

Data scientist Teresa Kubacka has recounted deliberately making up the phrase \"cycloidal inverted electromagnon\" and testing ChatGPT by asking it about the (nonexistent) phenomenon. ChatGPT invented a plausible-sounding answer backed with plausible-looking citations that compelled her to double-check whether she had accidentally typed in the name of a real phenomenon.

The high likelihood of returning non-existent reference material and incorrect information may require limitations to be put in place regarding these language models.

However, the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes. In addition, a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape, also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a false positive result for the presence of a sea urchin although there was none in the input image.<br>In reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes, but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes.}}\nThe concept of \"hallucination\" is applied more broadly than just natural language processing.
