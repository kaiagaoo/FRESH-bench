This divergence happens 1) as an artifact of heuristic data collection or 2) due to the nature of some [[Natural language generation|NLG]] tasks that inevitably contain such divergence. When a model is trained on data with source-reference (target) divergence, the model can be encouraged to generate text that is not necessarily grounded and not faithful to the provided source.<ref name=\"axiv\"/>\n\n====Hallucination from modeling====\nHallucination was shown to be a statistically inevitable byproduct of any imperfect generative model that is trained to maximize training likelihood, such as [[GPT-3]], and requires [[active learning (machine learning)|active learning]] (such as [[reinforcement learning from human feedback]]) to be avoided.<ref>{{Cite conference |url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v75/hanneke18a.html |title=Actively Avoiding Nonsense in Generative Models |last1=Hanneke |first1=Steve |last2=Kalai |first2=Adam Tauman |last3=Kamath |first3=Gautam |last4=Tzamos |first4=Christos |date=2018 |publisher=Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR) |volume=75 |pages=209\u2013227}}</ref> Other research takes an anthropomorphic perspective and posits hallucinations as arising from a tension between [[novelty]] and usefulness. For instance, [[Teresa Amabile]] and Pratt define human creativity as the production of novel and useful ideas.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Amabile |first1=Teresa M. |last2=Pratt |first2=Michael G. |title=The dynamic componential model of creativity and innovation in organizations: Making progress, making meaning |journal=Research in Organizational Behavior |year=2016 |volume=36 |pages=157\u2013183 |doi=10.1016/j.riob.2016.10.001|s2cid=44444992 }}</ref> By extension, a focus on novelty in machine creativity can lead to production of original but inaccurate responses, i.e. falsehoods, whereas a focus on usefulness can result in ineffectual rote memorized responses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mukherjee |first1=Anirban |last2=Chang |first2=Hannah H. |title=Managing the Creative Frontier of Generative AI: The Novelty-Usefulness Tradeoff |journal=California Management Review |year=2023 | url=https://cmr.berkeley.edu/2023/07/managing-the-creative-frontier-of-generative-ai-the-novelty-usefulness-tradeoff}}</ref>\n\nErrors in encoding and decoding between text and representations can cause hallucinations. When encoders learn the wrong correlations between different parts of the training data, it could result in an erroneous generation that diverges from the input.\nThe decoder takes the encoded input from the encoder and generates the final target sequence. Two aspects of decoding contribute to hallucinations. First, decoders can attend to the wrong part of the encoded input source, leading to erroneous generation. Second, the design of the decoding strategy itself can contribute to hallucinations. A decoding strategy that improves the generation diversity, such as top-k sampling, is positively correlated with increased hallucination.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}\n\nPre-training of models on a large corpus is known to result in the model memorizing knowledge in its parameters, creating hallucinations if the system is overconfident in its hardwired knowledge. In systems such as GPT-3, an AI generates each next word based on a sequence of previous words (including the words it has itself previously generated during the same conversation), causing a cascade of possible hallucination as the response grows longer.<ref name=\"axiv\" /> By 2022, papers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' expressed concern that, as adoption of bots based on large language models continued to grow, unwarranted user confidence in bot output could lead to problems.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Metz |first1=Cade |title=The New Chatbots Could Change the World.

Data scientist Teresa Kubacka has recounted deliberately making up the phrase \"cycloidal inverted electromagnon\" and testing ChatGPT by asking it about the (nonexistent) phenomenon.

A study that analyzed a total of 115 references provided by ChatGPT documented that 47% of them were fabricated. Another 46% cited real references but extracted incorrect information from them. Only the remaining 7% of references were cited correctly and provided accurate information. ChatGPT has also been observed to \"double-down\" on a lot of the incorrect information. When you ask ChatGPT about a mistake that may have been hallucinated, sometimes it will try to correct itself but other times it will claim the response is correct and provide even more [[Misinformation|misleading information]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bhattacharyya |first1=Mehul |last2=Miller |first2=Valerie M. |last3=Bhattacharyya |first3=Debjani |last4=Miller |first4=Larry E. |last5=Bhattacharyya |first5=Mehul |last6=Miller |first6=Valerie |last7=Bhattacharyya |first7=Debjani |last8=Miller |first8=Larry E. |date=2023-05-19 |title=High Rates of Fabricated and Inaccurate References in ChatGPT-Generated Medical Content |journal=Cureus |language=en |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=e39238 |doi=10.7759/cureus.39238 |doi-access=free |issn=2168-8184 |pmc=10277170 |pmid=37337480}}</ref>\n\nThese hallucinated articles generated by [[language model]]s also pose an issue because it is difficult to tell whether an article was generated by an AI.

The high likelihood of returning non-existent reference material and incorrect information may require limitations to be put in place regarding these language models.

These weak signals may result in a false positive result for the presence of a sea urchin although there was none in the input image.\n   \n   In reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes, but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes.}}\n\nThe concept of \"hallucination\" is applied more broadly than just natural language processing. A confident response from any AI that seems unjustified by the training data can be labeled a hallucination.<ref name=\"axiv\" />\n\n=== Object detection ===\nVarious researchers cited by [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] have classified adversarial hallucinations as a high-dimensional statistical phenomenon, or have attributed hallucinations to insufficient training data. Some researchers believe that some \"incorrect\" AI responses classified by humans as \"hallucinations\" in the case of [[object detection]] may in fact be justified by the training data, or even that an AI may be giving the \"correct\" answer that the human reviewers are failing to see. For example, an adversarial image that looks, to a human, like an ordinary image of a dog, may in fact be seen by the AI to contain tiny patterns that (in authentic images) would only appear when viewing a cat. The AI is detecting real-world visual patterns that humans are insensitive to.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Matsakis |first1=Louise |date=8 May 2019 |title=Artificial Intelligence May Not 'Hallucinate' After All |url=https://www.wired.com/story/adversarial-examples-ai-may-not-hallucinate/ |access-date=29 December 2022 |magazine=Wired}}</ref>\n\n''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' noted in 2018 that, despite no recorded attacks \"in the wild\" (that is, outside of [[proof-of-concept]] attacks by researchers), there was \"little dispute\" that consumer gadgets, and systems such as [[automated driving]], were susceptible to [[adversarial machine learning|adversarial attacks]] that could cause AI to hallucinate.
