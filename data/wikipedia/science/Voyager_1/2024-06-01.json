Since Saturn's internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds on Saturn. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about {{Convert|500|m/s|mph|abbr=unit}}. The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.<ref name=\"nasa-3\" />\n\nThe Voyagers found [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]-like [[ultraviolet]] emissions of [[hydrogen]] at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, and auroras at polar latitudes (above 65 degrees). The high-level auroral activity may lead to the formation of complex [[hydrocarbons|hydrocarbon molecules]] that are carried toward the [[equator]]. The mid-latitude auroras, which occur only in sunlit regions, remain a puzzle, since bombardment by electrons and ions, known to cause auroras on Earth, occurs primarily at high latitudes. Both Voyagers measured the [[sidereal day|rotation of Saturn]] (the length of a day) at 10 hours, 39 minutes, 24 seconds.<ref name=\"nasa-4\" />\n\n''Voyager 1''{{'}}s mission included a flyby of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which had long been known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within {{convert|4000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager's measurement of the atmosphere's effect on sunlight and Earth-based measurement of its effect on the probe's radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe's trajectory. The thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.<ref name=\"jim bell-2015\">{{Cite book |last=Jim Bell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXPoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT93 |title=The Interstellar Age: Inside the Forty-Year Voyager Mission |date=February 24, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-698-18615-6 |pages=93}}</ref>\n\nBecause observations of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for ''Voyager 1'' was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below the south pole of Saturn and out of the plane of the [[ecliptic]], ending its planetary science mission.<ref name=\"david w swift-1997\">{{Cite book |last=David W.
