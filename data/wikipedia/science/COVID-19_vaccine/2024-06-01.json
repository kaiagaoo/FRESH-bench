capacity to make up for a 125-million-dose gap in the [[COVAX]] program. The program mostly relied on the [[Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca COVID\u201119 vaccine]] produced by the [[Serum Institute of India]], which faced serious supply problems due to increased domestic vaccine needs in India from March to June 2021. Only a limited amount of vaccines can be distributed efficiently, and the shortfall of vaccines in South America and parts of Asia is due to a lack of expedient donations by richer nations. International aid organizations have pointed at Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives, as well as Argentina, Brazil, and some parts of the Caribbean, as problem areas where vaccines are in short supply. In mid-May 2021, UNICEF was also critical of the fact that most proposed donations of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were not slated for delivery until the second half of 2021 or early in 2022.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/05/un-agencies-make-urgent-appeal-covax-vaccine-doses |title=UN agencies make urgent appeal for COVAX vaccine doses |date=17 May 2021 |vauthors=Schnirring L |work=[[Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy|CIDRAP]] |access-date=15 June 2021 |archive-date=31 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211031100236/https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/05/un-agencies-make-urgent-appeal-covax-vaccine-doses |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:COVID-19 mass vaccination in Ratina, Tampere, Finland.jpg|thumb|left|COVID{{nbhyph}}19 mass vaccination queue in Finland, June 2021]]\nIn July 2021, the heads of the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade Organization said in a joint statement: \"As many countries are struggling with new variants and a third wave of COVID{{nbhyph}}19 infections, accelerating access to vaccines becomes even more critical to ending the pandemic everywhere and achieving broad-based growth.

However, in August, the United States government announced plans to offer booster doses eight months after the initial course to the general population, starting with priority groups. Before the announcement, the WHO harshly criticized this type of decision, citing the lack of evidence for the need for boosters, except for patients with specific conditions. At this time, vaccine coverage of at least one dose was 58% in high-income countries and only 1.3% in low-income countries, and 1.14 million Americans had already received an unauthorized booster dose. US officials argued that waning efficacy against mild and moderate disease might indicate reduced protection against severe disease in the coming months.
