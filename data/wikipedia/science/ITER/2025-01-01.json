Harnessing fusion power in terrestrial conditions would provide sufficient energy to satisfy mounting demand, and to do so in a sustainable manner that has a relatively small impact on the environment. One gram of [[deuterium-tritium]] fuel mixture in the process of [[nuclear fusion]] produces 90,000-kilowatt hours of energy, or the equivalent of 11 tonnes of coal.<ref>{{cite web|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=What is nuclear fusion?|url=https://www.ipp.mpg.de/15047/kernfusion|access-date=2021-03-20|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics}}</ref>\n\nNuclear fusion uses a different approach from traditional nuclear energy. Current nuclear power stations rely on nuclear fission with the nucleus of an atom being split to release energy.

However, the ITER project was gaining momentum in political circles due to the quiet work being done by two physicists, the American scientist [[Alvin Trivelpiece]] who served as Director of the Office of Energy Research in the 1980s and the Russian scientist [[Evgeny Velikhov]] who would become head of the [[Kurchatov Institute]] for nuclear research. The two scientists both supported a project to construct a demonstration fusion reactor. At the time, [[Magnetic confinement fusion|magnetic fusion]] research was ongoing in Japan, Europe, the Soviet Union and the US, but Trivelpiece and Velikhov believed that taking the next step in fusion research would be beyond the budget of any of the key nations and that collaboration would be useful internationally.<ref>{{cite web |last=Arnoux|first=Robert|title=Conceived in Geneva, Born in Reykjavik, Bapitized in Vienna|url= https://www.iter.org/fr/newsline/-/2323 | magazine=ITER Newsline |publisher=ITER|location=St. Paul-lez-Durance, France|date=2015-11-16|access-date=2021-03-20}}</ref>\n\nDr. Michael Robert, who is the director of International Programs of the Office of Fusion Energy at the US Department of Energy, explains that, 'In September 1985, I led a US science team to Moscow as part of our bilateral fusion activities.

For example, the French politician [[No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re]] argued that the fight against global warming would be neglected as a result of ITER: \u201cThis is not good news for the fight against the greenhouse effect because we're going to put ten billion euros towards a project that has a term of 30\u201350 years when we're not even sure it will be effective.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Mixed reactions to ITER |url= https://www.euractiv.com/section/innovation-industry/news/mixed-reactions-to-iter/ |website= Euractiv |location=Brussels, Belgium |date=2005-07-01 |access-date=2021-04-02}}</ref> However, another French environmental association, Association des Ecologistes Pour le Nucl\u00e9aire (AEPN), welcomed the ITER project as an important part of the response to climate change.<ref name=\"Claessens-2020\" />\n\nWithin the broader fusion sector, a number of researchers working on non-tokamak systems, such as the independent fusion scientist [[Eric Lerner]], have argued that other fusion projects would be a fraction of ITER's cost and could be a potentially more viable and/or more cost-effective path to fusion power.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Eric J. |last1=Lerner |author1-link=Eric Lerner |first2=Syed M. |last2=Hassan |first3=Ivana |last3=Karamitsos-Zivkovi\u010d |first4=Rudolph |last4=Fritsch |title=What are the fastest routes to fusion energy? |journal=Physics of Plasmas |volume=30 |issue=120602 |date=December 2023 |doi=10.1063/5.0170216 |url= https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article/30/12/120602/2928807/What-are-the-fastest-routes-to-fusion-energy |access-date=6 March 2024 |doi-access=free |bibcode=2023PhPl...30l0602L }}</ref> Other critics, such as Daniel Jassby, accuse ITER researchers of being unwilling to face up to the technical and economic potential problems posed by tokamak fusion schemes.<ref>{{cite web |last= Jassby|first= Daniel| title=ITER is a showcase\u2026 for the drawbacks of fusion energy|url= https://thebulletin.org/2018/02/iter-is-a-showcase-for-the-drawbacks-of-fusion-energy/ |website= Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |location=Chicago, IL, US |date=2018-02-14 |access-date=2021-04-02}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the design of the tokamak, one concern arose from the 2013 tokamak parameters database interpolation that revealed the power load on a tokamak [[divertor]] would be five times the previously expected value. Given that the projected power load on the ITER divertor will already be very high, these new findings led to new design testing initiatives.<ref name=Porkolab2013>[http://fire.pppl.gov/FPA13_Porkolab_MIT.pdf Innovation is Key from ITER to DEMO.

As it stands, ITER will use all existing supplies of tritium for its experiment and the current state-of-the-art technology isn't sufficient to generate enough tritium to fulfill the needs of future DT fuel cycle experiments for fusion energy. According to the conclusion of a 2020 study that analyzed the tritium issue, \u201csuccessful development of the DT fuel cycle for DEMO and future fusion reactors requires an intensive R&D program in key areas of plasma physics and fusion technologies.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Abdou|first1=Mohamed| title=Physics and technology considerations for the deuterium\u2013tritium fuel cycle and conditions for tritium fuel self sufficiency|url= https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/abbf35 |journal=Nuclear Fusion|year=2021|volume=61|issue=1|page=013001|publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna, Austria|doi=10.1088/1741-4326/abbf35|bibcode=2021NucFu..61a3001A|s2cid=229444533|access-date=2021-10-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Responses to criticism ===\nProponents believe that much of the ITER criticism is misleading and inaccurate, in particular the allegations of the experiment's \"inherent danger\". The stated goals for a commercial fusion power station design are that the amount of [[radioactive waste]] produced should be hundreds of times less than that of a fission reactor, and that it should produce no long-lived radioactive waste, and that it is impossible for any such reactor to undergo a [[nuclear meltdown|large-scale runaway chain reaction]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.iter.org/sci/Fusion|title=Advantages of fusion|newspaper=ITER|access-date=19 October 2016}}</ref> A direct contact of the plasma with ITER inner walls would contaminate it, causing it to cool immediately and stop the fusion process. In addition, the amount of fuel contained in a fusion reactor chamber (one half gram of deuterium/tritium fuel<ref name=iter>[http://www.iter.org/ ITER website]. Iter.org. Retrieved 21 May 2013.</ref>) is only sufficient to sustain the fusion burn pulse from minutes up to an hour at most, whereas a fission reactor usually contains several years' worth of fuel.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100630030449/http://www.stpnoc.com/Fyi.htm Facts and Stats... 1/3 of fuel rods changed every 18 months].

Furthermore, ITER's type of fusion power has little in common with nuclear weapons technology, and does not produce the fissile materials necessary for the construction of a weapon. Proponents note that large-scale fusion power would be able to produce reliable electricity on demand, and with virtually zero pollution (no gaseous CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, or NO<sub>x</sub> by-products are produced).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Advantages of fusion|url=http://www.iter.org/sci/fusion|access-date=2022-02-11|website=ITER|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAccording to researchers at a demonstration reactor in Japan, a fusion generator should be feasible in the 2030s and no later than the 2050s.
