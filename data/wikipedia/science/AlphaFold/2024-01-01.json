Such correlations suggest that the residues may be close to each other physically, even though not close in the sequence, allowing a [[contact map]] to be estimated.  Building on recent work prior to 2018, AlphaFold 1 extended this to estimate a probability distribution for just ''how'' close the residues might be likely to be\u2014turning the contact map into a likely distance map.  It also used more advanced learning methods than previously to develop the inference.

Each residual block has three layers including a 3\u00d73 dilated convolutional layer \u2013 the blocks cycle through dilation of values 1, 2, 4, and 8. In total the model has 21 million parameters. The network uses a combination of 1D and 2D inputs, including [[evolutionary profiles]] from different sources and co-evolution features. Alongside a distance map in the form of a very finely-grained histogram of distances, AlphaFold predicts [[Ramachandran plot|\u03a6 and \u03a8 angles]] for each residue which are used to create the initial predicted 3D structure. The AlphaFold authors concluded that the depth of the model, its large crop size, the large training set of roughly 29,000 proteins, modern Deep Learning techniques, and the richness of information from the predicted histogram of distances helped AlphaFold achieve a high contact map prediction precision.</blockquote>\n\n=== AlphaFold 2, 2020 ===\n[[File:AlphaFold 2.png|thumb|upright=1.3|AlphaFold 2 performance, experiments, and architecture<ref name=\"nature\">{{cite journal |last1=Jumper |first1=John |last2=Evans |first2=Richard |last3=Pritzel |first3=Alexander |last4=Green |first4=Tim |last5=Figurnov |first5=Michael |last6=Ronneberger |first6=Olaf |last7=Tunyasuvunakool |first7=Kathryn |last8=Bates |first8=Russ |last9=\u017d\u00eddek |first9=Augustin |last10=Potapenko |first10=Anna |last11=Bridgland |first11=Alex |last12=Meyer |first12=Clemens |last13=Kohl |first13=Simon A.
