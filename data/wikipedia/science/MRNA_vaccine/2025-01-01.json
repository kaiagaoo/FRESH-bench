Within 10 months, mRNA vaccines were both the first to be approved and the most effective. Although these are the first mRNA vaccines to be approved, the story of mRNA vaccines starts more than 30 years ago, with many bumps in the road along the way. In 1990, the late physician-scientist Jon Wolff and his University of Wisconsin colleagues injected mRNA into mice, which caused cells in the mice to produce the encoded proteins. In many ways, that work served as the first step toward making a vaccine from mRNA, but there was a long way to go\u2014and there still is, for many applications.|vauthors=May M|archive-date=13 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211013231549/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01393-8?proof=t%29.|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Xu S, Yang K, Li R, Zhang L|date=September 2020|title=mRNA Vaccine Era-Mechanisms, Drug Platform and Clinical Prospection|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=21|issue=18|pages=6582|doi=10.3390/ijms21186582|pmc=7554980|pmid=32916818|quote=Concept proposal of mRNA vaccines (1990)|doi-access=free |title-link=doi }}</ref><ref>Patent: [https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO1990011092&tab=PCTBIBLIO WO1990011092] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211014020102/https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO1990011092&tab=PCTBIBLIO |date=14 October 2021 }}; Inventors: Philip L.
