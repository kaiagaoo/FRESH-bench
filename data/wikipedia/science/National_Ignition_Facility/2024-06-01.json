During these meetings, the idea later known as [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]] emerged. PACER envisioned the explosion of small [[hydrogen bomb]]s in large caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power. After identifying problems with this approach, Nuckolls wondered how small a bomb could be made that would still generate net positive power.<ref name=\"EarlyNuckolls\" />\n\nA typical hydrogen bomb has two parts: a plutonium-based fission bomb known as the ''primary'', and a cylindrical arrangement of fusion fuels known as the ''secondary''. The primary releases x-rays, which are trapped within the bomb casing. They heat and compress the secondary until it ignites. The secondary consists of [[lithium deuteride]] (LiD) fuel, which requires an external neutron source. This is normally in the form of a small plutonium \"spark plug\" in the center of the fuel. Nuckolls's idea was to explore how small the secondary could be made, and what effects this would have on the energy needed from the primary to cause ignition. The simplest change is to replace the LiD fuel with DT gas, removing the need for the spark plug. This allows secondaries of any size \u2013 as the secondary shrinks, so does the amount of energy needed for ignition. At the milligram level, the energy levels started to approach those available through several known devices.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls>{{cite web|first=John |last=Nuckolls|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/658936-fpqpjO/webviewable/658936.pdf |title=Early Steps Toward Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221213185556/https://www.osti.gov/biblio/658936 |archive-date=December 13, 2022 |publisher=LLNL |date=June 12, 1998|doi=10.2172/658936 }}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, Nuckolls and several other weapons designers had developed ICF's outlines. The DT fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acts like the bomb casing. The hohlraum did not have to be heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to heat the hohlraum and produce x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5&nbsp;MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1&nbsp;MJ beam.<ref name=\"EarlyNuckolls\" /> To put this in perspective, a small (0.5&nbsp;kt ) fission primary releases 2 TJ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-kT-to-MJ.html |title=Convert kilotons, to megajoules|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221213185558/https://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-kT-to-MJ.html |archive-date=December 13, 2022 |publisher=Unit Juggler}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|display-authors=etal |author=Nuckolls |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf |title=Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922173009/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf |archive-date=September 22, 2011 |journal=Nature |volume= 239|year= 1972 |issue=5368 |page= 129|doi=10.1038/239139a0 |bibcode=1972Natur.239..139N |s2cid=45684425 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Lindl |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf \n|title=The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221213185556/https://www.osti.gov/biblio/10126383 |archive-date=December 13, 2022 |publisher=11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena |date=December 1994|access-date= May 7, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== ICF program, 1970s ===\nWhile Nuckolls and LLNL were working on hohlraum-based concepts, [[University of California, San Diego|UCSD]] physicist [[Keith Brueckner]] was independently working on direct drive. In the early 1970s, Brueckner formed [[KMS Fusion]] to commercialize this concept. This sparked an intense rivalry between KMS and the weapons labs. Formerly ignored, ICF became a hot topic and most of the labs started ICF work.<ref name=\"EarlyNuckolls\" /> LLNL decided to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e.g. ANTARES, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]) or KrF (e.g. [[Nike laser]], [[Naval Research Laboratory]]).<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/multimedia/publications/pdfs/etr/1985_02_1.pdf |title=Nova Review|journal=Energy and Technology Review}}</ref>\n\nThroughout these early stages, much of the understanding of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily [[LASNEX]]. LASNEX simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional approximation, which was all that was possible with the available computing power. LASNEX estimated that laser drivers in the kJ range could reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art.<ref name=\"EarlyNuckolls\" /> This led to the [[Shiva laser]] project which was completed in 1977. Shiva fell far short of its goals. The densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target. Most of its energy energized electrons rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.llnl.gov/archives/1970s/shiva-laser-system|title=Shiva Laser System|website=www.llnl.gov}}</ref>\n\nFurther upgrades to the simulation programs, accounting for these effects, predicted that a different design would reach ignition. This system took the form of the 20-beam 200&nbsp;kJ [[Nova laser]]. During the construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by former LLNL director [[John S. Foster Jr.]] confirmed that Nova would not reach ignition. It was modified into a smaller 10-beam design that converted the light to 351&nbsp;nm and increase coupling efficiency.<ref name=peer>{{cite tech report |first1=Matthew |last1=McKinzie |first2=Christopher |last2=Paine |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nif2/findings.asp |title=When Peer Review Fails |publisher=NDRC}}</ref> Nova was able to deliver about 30&nbsp;kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was expected, primarily due to optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.{{cn|date=January 2023}}\n\n=== Halite and Centurion, 1978 ===\nEach experiment showed that the energy needed to reach ignition continued to be underestimated. The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) decided that direct experimentation was the best way to settle the issue, and in 1978 they started a series of underground experiments at the [[Nevada Test Site]] that used small nuclear bombs to illuminate ICF targets. The tests were known as Halite (LLNL) and Centurion (LANL).<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012384656300012X|title=Fusion|first1=Garry|last1=McCracken|first2=Peter|last2=Stott|chapter=Chapter 12 \u2013 Large Inertial-Confinement Systems |editor-first1=Garry|editor-last1=McCracken|editor-first2=Peter|editor-last2=Stott|date=January 1, 2013|publisher=Academic Press|pages=149\u2013164|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-384656-3.00012-X |isbn=978-0-12-384656-3 |via=ScienceDirect|edition=Second }}</ref>\n\nThe basic concept behind the tests had been developed in the 1960s as a way to develop [[anti-ballistic missile]] warheads. It was found that bombs that exploded outside the atmosphere gave off bursts of X-rays that could damage an enemy warhead at long range. To test the effectiveness of this system, and to develop countermeasures to protect US warheads, the [[Defense Atomic Support Agency]] developed a system that placed the targets at the end of long tunnels behind fast-shutting doors. The doors were timed to shut in the brief period between the arrival of the X-rays and the subsequent blast. This saved the [[reentry vehicle]] (RV) from blast damage and allowed them to be inspected.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nICF tests used the same system, replacing the RVs by hohlraums. Each test simultaneously illuminated many targets, each at a different distance from the bomb to test the effect of varying of illumination. Another question was how large the fuel assembly had to be in order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests.

Then, NIF was upgraded, improving diagnostic and measurement instruments. The Advanced Radiographic Capability (ARC) system was added, which uses 4 of the NIF's 192 beams as a backlight for imaging the implosion sequence. ARC is essentially a petawatt-class laser with peak power exceeding a quadrillion (10<sup>15</sup>) watts. It is designed to produce brighter, more penetrating, higher-energy x rays.

However:\n:The integrated conclusion based on this extensive period of experimentation, however, is that considerable hurdles must be overcome to reach ignition or the goal of observing unequivocal alpha heating. Indeed the reviewers note that given the unknowns with the present 'semi-empirical' approach, the probability of ignition before the end of December is extremely low and even the goal of demonstrating unambiguous alpha heating is challenging.<ref name=\"Crandall\" />{{Rp|page=2}}\n\nFurther, the report expressed deep concerns that the gaps between observed performance and simulation codes implied that the current codes were of limited utility. Specifically, they found a lack of predictive ability of the radiation drive to the capsule and inadequately modeled laser\u2013plasma interactions. Pressure was reaching only one half to one third of that required for ignition, far below the predicted values. The memo discussed the mixing of ablator material and capsule fuel likely due to hydrodynamics instabilities in the ablator's outer surface.<ref name=\"Crandall\" />\n\nThe report suggested using a thicker ablator, although this would increase its inertia. To keep the required implosion speed, they proposed that the NIF energy be increased to 2MJ. It questioned whether or not the energy was sufficient to compress a large enough capsule to avoid the mix limit and reach ignition.{{sfn|Crandall|2012|p=5}} The report concluded that ignition within the calendar year 2012 was 'highly unlikely'.<ref name=\"Crandall\" />\n\nNIC officially ended on September 30, 2012.

The material of the capsule shell was changed to diamond to increase the absorbance of secondary x-rays created by the laser burst, thus increasing the efficacy of the collapse, and its surface was further smoothed. The size of the hole in the capsule used to inject fuel was reduced. The holes in the gold cylinder surrounding the capsule were shrunk to reduce energy loss.
