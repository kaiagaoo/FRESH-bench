Make a small multilayered perceptron <math>f</math>, so that for any image <math>y</math>, the post-processed vector <math>f(E(y))</math> has the same dimensions as an encoded token.

After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled ''[[The Language Myth|The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct]]'', British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist [[Vyvyan Evans]] mapped out the role of [[probabilistic context-free grammar]] (PCFG) in enabling [[Natural language processing#Cognition|NLP to model cognitive patterns]] and generate human like language.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Language Myth |last= Evans |first= Vyvyan. |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2014|isbn=978-1-107-04396-1}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|title=Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior; Chapter 4 The Generative Models of Active Inference |last= Friston |first= Karl J. |publisher= The MIT Press|year=2022|isbn=978-0-262-36997-8}}</ref>\n\n== Evaluation ==\n\n=== Perplexity ===\nThe most commonly used measure of a language model's performance is its [[perplexity]] on a given text corpus. Perplexity is a measure of how well a model is able to predict the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. Mathematically, perplexity is defined as the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token:<math display=\"block\">\\log(\\text{Perplexity}) = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log(\\Pr(\\text{token}_i \\mid \\text{context for token}_i))</math>here <math>N</math> is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and \"context for token <math>i</math>\" depends on the specific type of LLM used. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context for token <math>i</math>\" is the segment of text appearing before token <math>i</math>. If the LLM is masked, then \"context for token <math>i</math>\" is the segment of text surrounding token <math>i</math>.\n\nBecause language models may [[overfit]] to their training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a [[test set]] of unseen data.<ref name=\"jm\" /> This presents particular challenges for the evaluation of large language models. As they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text largely scraped from the web, it becomes increasingly likely that models' training data inadvertently includes portions of any given test set.<ref name=\"few-shot-learners\" />\n\n====BPW, BPC, and BPT====\nIn [[information theory]], the concept of [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by [[Claude Shannon]].<ref name=\"Huyen\">{{cite web |url=https://thegradient.pub/understanding-evaluation-metrics-for-language-models/ |title=Evaluation Metrics for Language Modeling |last=Huyen |first=Chip |date=October 18, 2019 |website=The Gradient |access-date=January 14, 2024}}</ref> This relationship is mathematically expressed as <math>\\text{Entropy} = \\log_2(\\text{Perplexity})</math>.\n\nEntropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.\n\nNotably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.\n\nIn the evaluation and comparison of language models, [[cross-entropy]] is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.\n\n=== Task-specific datasets and benchmarks ===\nA large number of testing datasets and benchmarks have also been developed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on more specific downstream tasks. Tests may be designed to evaluate a variety of capabilities, including general knowledge, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.\n\nOne broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\", \"No\").<ref name=\"boolq\">{{cite arXiv |eprint=1905.10044 |class=cs.CL |first1=Christopher |last1=Clark |first2=Kenton |last2=Lee |title=BoolQ: Exploring the Surprising Difficulty of Natural Yes/No Questions |last3=Chang |first3=Ming-Wei |last4=Kwiatkowski |first4=Tom |last5=Collins |first5=Michael |last6=Toutanova |first6=Kristina |year=2019}}</ref> A question answering task is considered \"open book\" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\"<ref name=\"boolq\" />). Otherwise, the task is considered \"closed book\", and the model must draw on knowledge retained during training.<ref name=\"survey\">{{cite arXiv |eprint=2303.18223 |class=cs.CL |author1=Wayne Xin Zhao |first2=Kun |last2=Zhou |title=A Survey of Large Language Models |last3=Li |first3=Junyi |last4=Tang |first4=Tianyi |last5=Wang |first5=Xiaolei |last6=Hou |first6=Yupeng |last7=Min |first7=Yingqian |last8=Zhang |first8=Beichen |last9=Zhang |first9=Junjie |last10=Dong |first10=Zican |last11=Du |first11=Yifan |last12=Yang |first12=Chen |last13=Chen |first13=Yushuo |last14=Chen |first14=Zhipeng |last15=Jiang |first15=Jinhao |last16=Ren |first16=Ruiyang |last17=Li |first17=Yifan |last18=Tang |first18=Xinyu |last19=Liu |first19=Zikang |last20=Liu |first20=Peiyu |last21=Nie |first21=Jian-Yun |last22=Wen |first22=Ji-Rong |year=2023}}</ref> Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.<ref name=\"survey\" />\n\nEvaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: \"Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____\".<ref name=\"few-shot-learners\" />\n\nSome composite benchmarks have also been developed which combine a diversity of different evaluation datasets and tasks. Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, [[MMLU]], BIG-bench, and HELM.<ref name=\"Huyen\" /><ref name=\"survey\" /> OpenAI has released tools for running composite benchmarks, but noted that the eval results are sensitive to the prompting method.<ref>{{Citation |title=openai/simple-evals |date=2024-05-28 |url=https://github.com/openai/simple-evals |access-date=2024-05-28 |publisher=OpenAI}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=openai/evals |date=2024-05-28 |url=https://github.com/openai/evals |access-date=2024-05-28 |publisher=OpenAI}}</ref>\n\nIt was previously standard to report results on a heldout portion of an evaluation dataset after doing supervised fine-tuning on the remainder. It is now more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques, though researchers vary in the details of how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to how many examples of solved tasks are adjoined to the prompt (i.e. the value of ''n'' in ''n''-shot prompting).\n\n==== Adversarially constructed evaluations ====\nBecause of the rapid pace of improvement of large language models, evaluation benchmarks have suffered from short lifespans, with state of the art models quickly \"saturating\" existing benchmarks, exceeding the performance of human annotators, leading to efforts to replace or augment the benchmark with more challenging tasks.<ref name=\"bigbench\">{{cite arXiv |eprint=2206.04615 |class=cs.CL |first1=Aarohi |last1=Srivastava |first2=Abhinav |last2=Rastogi |title=Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and extrapolating the capabilities of language models |last3=Rao |first3=Abhishek |author4=Abu Awal Md Shoeb |last5=Abid |first5=Abubakar |last6=Fisch |first6=Adam |last7=Brown |first7=Adam R. |last8=Santoro |first8=Adam |last9=Gupta |first9=Aditya |last10=Garriga-Alonso |first10=Adri\u00e0 |last11=Kluska |first11=Agnieszka |last12=Lewkowycz |first12=Aitor |last13=Agarwal |first13=Akshat |last14=Power |first14=Alethea |last15=Ray |first15=Alex |last16=Warstadt |first16=Alex |last17=Kocurek |first17=Alexander W. |last18=Safaya |first18=Ali |last19=Tazarv |first19=Ali |last20=Xiang |first20=Alice |last21=Parrish |first21=Alicia |last22=Nie |first22=Allen |last23=Hussain |first23=Aman |last24=Askell |first24=Amanda |last25=Dsouza |first25=Amanda |last26=Slone |first26=Ambrose |last27=Rahane |first27=Ameet |last28=Iyer |first28=Anantharaman S. |last29=Andreassen |first29=Anders |last30=Madotto |first30=Andrea |year=2022 |display-authors=1}}</ref> In addition, there are cases of \"shortcut learning\" wherein AIs sometimes \"cheat\" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording in order to guess the correct responses, without necessarily understanding the actual question being asked.<ref name=\"debate understanding\" />\n\nSome datasets have been constructed adversarially, focusing on particular problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually poor performance compared to humans. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions which language models are susceptible to answering incorrectly by mimicking falsehoods to which they were repeatedly exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer \"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom ''[[wikt:you can't teach an old dog new tricks|you can't teach an old dog new tricks]]'', even though this is not literally true.<ref name=\"truthfulqa\">{{cite arXiv |eprint=2109.07958 |class=cs.CL |first1=Stephanie |last1=Lin |first2=Jacob |last2=Hilton |title=TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods |last3=Evans |first3=Owain |year=2021}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model and filtering with a set of classifiers. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but at the time the datasets were created state of the art language models had poor accuracy on them. For example:\n<blockquote>\nWe see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...\n{{br}}a) demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.\n{{br}}b) moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.\n{{br}}c) then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.\n{{br}}d) performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.<ref name=\"hellaswag\">{{cite arXiv |eprint=1905.07830 |class=cs.CL |first1=Rowan |last1=Zellers |first2=Ari |last2=Holtzman |title=HellaSwag: Can a Machine Really Finish Your Sentence? |last3=Bisk |first3=Yonatan |last4=Farhadi |first4=Ali |last5=Choi |first5=Yejin |year=2019}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[BERT (language model)|BERT]] selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d).<ref name=\"hellaswag\" />\n\n== Wider impact ==\nIn 2023, ''[[Nature Biomedical Engineering]]'' wrote that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate...

In their study, they examined and confirmed the possibility that questioners could get, from ChatGPT, the training data that the AI model used. For example, when asking ChatGPT 3.5 turbo to repeat the word \"poem\" forever, the AI model will say \"poem\" hundreds of times and then diverge, deviating from the standard dialogue style and spitting out nonsense phrases, thus spitting out the training data as it is. The researchers have seen more than 10,000 examples of the AI model exposing their training data in a similar method. The researchers said that it was hard to tell if the AI model was actually safe or not.<ref>\n{{Cite web |author=Stephen Council |date=1 Dec 2023 |title=How Googlers cracked an SF rival's tech model with a single word |url=https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/google-openai-chatgpt-break-model-18525445.php |accessdate= |publisher=SFGATE}}\n</ref>\n\nThe potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLM models is another emerging security concern.
