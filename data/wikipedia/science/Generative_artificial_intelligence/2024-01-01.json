It began with science fiction familiarizing the world with the concept but the idea wasn't fully seen in the scientific manner until [[Alan Turing]], a polymath, was curious about the feasibility of the concept. Turing's groundbreaking 1950 paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" posed fundamental questions about machine reasoning similar to human intelligence, significantly contributing to the conceptual groundwork of AI. The development of AI was not very rapid at first because of the high costs and the fact that computers were not able to store commands. This changed during the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI where there was an inspiring call for AI research which led it to be a landmark event as it set the precedent for two decades of rapid advancements in the field.<ref>{{Cite web |last=SITNFlash |date=2017-08-28 |title=The History of Artificial Intelligence |url=https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/ |access-date=2023-12-08 |website=Science in the News |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nSince the founding of AI in the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works.
