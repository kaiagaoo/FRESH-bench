This is the same type of bonding seen in [[carbon nanotube]]s and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, and (partially) in [[fullerene]]s and [[glassy carbon]].<ref name=zdet2015/><ref name=harris2018/> The valence band is touched by a [[conduction band]], making graphene a [[semimetal]] with unusual [[electronic properties of graphene|electronic properties]] that are best described by theories for massless relativistic particles.<ref name=geim2007/> Charge carriers in graphene show linear, rather than quadratic, dependence of energy on momentum, and field-effect transistors with graphene can be made that show bipolar conduction.

It has likely been unknowingly produced in small quantities for centuries, through the use of pencils and other similar applications of graphite. It was possibly observed in [[electron microscope]]s in 1962, but studied only while supported on metal surfaces.<ref name=boehm1962a/>\n\nIn 2004, the material was rediscovered, isolated and investigated at the [[University of Manchester]],<ref name=novo2004/><ref name=aps2009/> by [[Andre Geim]] and [[Konstantin Novoselov]]. In 2010, Geim and Novoselov were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their \"groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2010|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2010/summary/|url-status=live|access-date=1 September 2021|publisher=Nobel Foundation}}</ref> High-quality graphene proved to be surprisingly easy to isolate.\n\nGraphene has become a valuable and useful [[nanomaterial]] due to its exceptionally high tensile strength, electrical conductivity, transparency, and being the thinnest two-dimensional material in the world.<ref name=poot/> The global market for graphene was $9 million in 2012,<ref name=azon2014/> with most of the demand from research and development in semiconductor, electronics, [[electric battery|electric batteries]],<ref name=mrmak2014/> and [[composite material|composites]].\n\nThe [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] (International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry) recommends use of the name \"graphite\" for the three-dimensional material, and \"graphene\" only when the reactions, structural relations, or other properties of individual layers are discussed.<ref name=IUPAC2009/> A narrower definition, of \"isolated or free-standing graphene\" requires that the layer be sufficiently isolated from its environment,<ref name=geim2009a/> but would include layers suspended or transferred to [[silicon dioxide]] or [[silicon carbide]].<ref name=ried2009/>\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n{{main|Discovery of graphene}}\n[[File:Nobelpriset i fysik 2010.png|thumb|A lump of [[graphite]], a graphene [[transistor]], and a [[tape dispenser]].

Kohlsch\u00fctter and P. Haenni in 1918, who also described the properties of [[graphene oxide paper|graphite oxide paper]].<ref name=kohl1918/> Its structure was determined from [[Single crystal|single-crystal]] diffraction in 1924.<ref name=bern1924/><ref name=hass1924/>\n\nThe theory of graphene was first explored by [[P. R. Wallace]] in 1947 as a starting point for understanding the electronic properties of 3D graphite. The emergent massless [[Dirac equation]] was first pointed out in 1984 separately by [[Gordon Walter Semenoff]],<ref name=\"Semenoff\">{{cite journal |last1=Semenoff |first1=Gordon W. |title=Condensed-Matter Simulation of a Three-Dimensional Anomaly |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=24 December 1984 |volume=53 |issue=26 |pages=2449\u20132452 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.53.2449 |bibcode=1984PhRvL..53.2449S }}</ref> and by David P. DiVincenzo and Eugene J. Mele.<ref name=divi1984/> Semenoff emphasized the occurrence in a magnetic field of an electronic [[Landau level]] precisely at the [[Dirac point]]. This level is responsible for the anomalous integer [[quantum Hall effect]].<ref name=novo2005/><ref name=gusy2005/><ref name=zhang2005/>\n\n===Observations of thin graphite layers and related structures===\n\n[[Transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM) images of thin graphite samples consisting of a few graphene layers were published by G. Ruess and F. Vogt in 1948.<ref name=ruess1948/>  Eventually, single layers were also observed directly.<ref name=meyer2007/> Single layers of graphite were also observed by [[transmission electron microscopy]] within bulk materials, in particular inside soot obtained by chemical [[Layered materials#Exfoliation|exfoliation]].<ref name=harris2018/>\n\nIn 1961\u20131962, [[Hanns-Peter Boehm]] published a study of extremely thin flakes of graphite, and coined the term \"graphene\" for the hypothetical single-layer structure.<ref name=boehm1962b/>  This paper reports graphitic flakes that give an additional contrast equivalent of down to ~0.4 [[nanometre|nm]] or 3 atomic layers of amorphous carbon. This was the best possible resolution for 1960 TEMs. However, neither then nor today is it possible to argue how many layers were in those flakes. Now we know that the TEM contrast of graphene most strongly depends on focusing conditions.<ref name=meyer2007/> For example, it is impossible to distinguish between suspended monolayer and multilayer graphene by their TEM contrasts, and the only known way is to analyze the relative intensities of various diffraction spots. The first reliable TEM observations of monolayers are probably given in refs. 24 and 26 of Geim and Novoselov's 2007 review.<ref name=geim2007/>\n\nStarting in the 1970s, C. Oshima and others described single layers of carbon atoms that were grown epitaxially on top of other materials.<ref name=oshi1997/><ref name=forb1998/> This \"epitaxial graphene\" consists of a single-atom-thick hexagonal lattice of sp<sup>2</sup>-bonded carbon atoms, as in free-standing graphene. However, there is significant charge transfer between the two materials, and, in some cases, hybridization between the [[d-orbital]]s of the substrate atoms and \u03c0 orbitals of graphene; which significantly alter the electronic structure compared to that of free-standing graphene.\n\nThe term \"graphene\" was used again in 1987 to describe single sheets of graphite as a constituent of [[graphite intercalation compound]]s,<ref name=mour1987/> which can be seen as crystalline salts of the intercalant and graphene. It was also used in the descriptions of [[carbon nanotube]]s by [[R. Saito]] and [[Mildred Dresselhaus|Mildred]] and [[Gene Dresselhaus]] in 1992,<ref name=saito1992/> and of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in 2000 by S. Wang and others.<ref name=wang2000/>\n\nEfforts to make thin films of graphite by mechanical exfoliation started in 1990.<ref name=geim2008/>\nInitial attempts employed exfoliation techniques similar to the drawing method. Multilayer samples down to 10&nbsp;nm in thickness were obtained.<ref name=geim2007/>\n\nIn 2002, [[Robert B. Rutherford]] and Richard L. Dudman filed for a [[patent]] in the US on a method to produce graphene by repeatedly peeling off layers from a graphite flake adhered to a substrate, achieving a graphite thickness of {{convert|0.00001|inch|m|abbr=off|lk=on}}. The key to success was high-throughput visual recognition of graphene on a properly chosen substrate, which provides a small but noticeable optical contrast.<ref name=ruth2002/>\n\nAnother U.S. patent was filed in the same year by  Bor Z. Jang and Wen C. Huang for a method to produce graphene based on exfoliation followed by attrition.<ref name=jang2002/>\n\nIn 2014, inventor [[Larry W. Fullerton|Larry Fullerton]] patents a process for producing single layer graphene sheets.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Graphene edges closer to widespread production and application |url=https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/cedar-ridge-research-receives-pioneer-patent-for-free-floating-graphene-production-technology |access-date=2022-03-25 |website=www.compositesworld.com |date=10 August 2016 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Full isolation and characterization===\n\n[[File:Nobel Prize 2010-Press Conference KVA-DSC 8009.jpg|thumb|Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the Nobel Laureate press conference, [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], 2010.]]\nGraphene was properly isolated and characterized in 2004 by [[Andre Geim]] and [[Konstantin Novoselov]] at the [[University of Manchester]].<ref name=novo2004/><ref name=aps2009/>  They pulled graphene layers from graphite with a common [[adhesive tape]] in a process called either micromechanical cleavage or the [[Scotch tape]] technique.<ref name=manch2014/> The graphene flakes were then transferred onto thin [[silicon dioxide]] (silica) layer on a [[silicon]] plate (\"wafer\"). The silica electrically isolated the graphene and weakly interacted with it, providing nearly charge-neutral graphene layers. The silicon beneath the {{chem|SiO|2}} could be used as a \"back gate\" electrode to vary the charge density in the graphene over a wide range.\n\nThis work resulted in the two winning the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2010 \"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.\"<ref name=ukiop2010/><ref name=nobel2013/><ref name=manch2014/>  Their publication, and the surprisingly easy preparation method that they described, sparked a \"graphene gold rush\".  Research expanded and split off into many different subfields, exploring different exceptional properties of the material\u2014quantum mechanical, electrical, chemical, mechanical, optical, magnetic, etc.\n\n===Exploring commercial applications===\n\nSince the early 2000s, a number of companies and research laboratories have been working to develop commercial applications of graphene.  In 2014 a [[National Graphene Institute]] was established with that purpose at the University of Manchester, with a 60 million [[British pound|GBP]] initial funding.<ref name=manch2014f/>  In [[North East England]] two commercial manufacturers, [[Applied Graphene Materials]]<ref name=burn2014/> and [[Thomas Swan|Thomas Swan Limited]]<ref name=gibs2014/><ref name=thej2014/> have begun manufacturing. [[Cambridge Nanosystems]]<ref name=canew2015/> is a large-scale graphene powder production facility in [[East Anglia]].\n\n==Structure==\nGraphene is a single layer (monolayer) of carbon atoms, tightly bound in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice. It is an allotrope of carbon in the form of a plane of sp2-bonded atoms with a molecular bond length of 0.142 nanometres.\n\n===Bonding===\n[[File:Carbon hybrid orbitals - from s+px,py,pz to sp\u00b2+pz.svg|thumb|250x250px|Carbon orbitals 2s, 2p<sub>x</sub>, 2p<sub>y</sub> form the hybrid orbital sp<sup>2</sup> with three major lobes at 120\u00b0.

These orbitals hybridize together to form two half-filled [[conduction band|bands]] of free-moving electrons, \u03c0 and \u03c0\u2217, which are responsible for most of graphene's notable electronic properties.<ref name=coop2012/> Recent quantitative estimates of aromatic stabilization and limiting size derived from the enthalpies of hydrogenation (\u0394H<sub>hydro</sub>) agree well with the literature reports.<ref name=dixit2019/>\n\nGraphene sheets stack to form graphite with an interplanar spacing of {{convert|0.335|nm|angstrom|abbr=on|lk=on}}.\n\nGraphene sheets in solid form usually show evidence in diffraction for graphite's (002) layering. This is true of some single-walled nanostructures.<ref name=kasu2002/> However, unlayered graphene with only (hk0) rings has been found in the core of [[presolar grains|presolar]] graphite onions.<ref name=bern1996/> TEM studies show faceting at defects in flat graphene sheets<ref name=fraun2002/> and suggest a role for two-dimensional crystallization from a melt.\n\n===Geometry===\n[[File:Graphene SPM.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Scanning probe microscopy]] image of graphene|alt=]]\n\nThe hexagonal lattice [[atomic structure|structure]] of isolated, single-layer graphene can be directly seen with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of sheets of graphene suspended between bars of a metallic grid<ref name=meyer2007/>  Some of these images showed a \"rippling\" of the flat sheet, with amplitude of about one nanometer. These ripples may be intrinsic to the material as a result of the instability of two-dimensional crystals,<ref name=geim2007/><ref name=carl2007/><ref name=faso2007/> or may originate from the ubiquitous dirt seen in all TEM images of graphene.  [[Photoresist]] residue, which must be removed to obtain atomic-resolution images, may be the \"[[adsorbate]]s\" observed in TEM images, and may explain the observed rippling.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\nThe hexagonal structure is also seen in [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) images of graphene supported on silicon dioxide substrates<ref name=ishi2007/>  The rippling seen in these images is caused by conformation of graphene to the subtrate's lattice, and is not intrinsic.<ref name=ishi2007/>\n\n===Stability===\n\n[[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|Ab initio calculations]] show that a graphene sheet is thermodynamically unstable if its size is less than about 20&nbsp;nm and becomes the most stable [[fullerene]] (as within graphite) only for molecules larger than 24,000 atoms.<ref name=shen2006/>\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Electronic===\n{{main|Electronic properties of graphene}}\n\n[[File:Electronic band structure of graphene.svg|thumb|306x306px|Electronic band structure of graphene. Valence and conduction bands meet at the six vertices of the hexagonal Brillouin zone and form linearly dispersing Dirac cones.]]\nGraphene is a zero-gap [[semiconductor]], because its [[Conduction band|conduction]] and [[valence bands]] meet at the [[Dirac points]]. The Dirac points are six locations in [[momentum space]], on the edge of the [[Brillouin zone]], divided into two non-equivalent sets of three points. The two sets are labeled K and K'. The sets give graphene a valley degeneracy of {{nowrap |1=''gv'' = 2}}. By contrast, for traditional semiconductors the primary point of interest is generally \u0393, where momentum is zero.<ref name=coop2012/> Four electronic properties separate it from other [[condensed matter]] systems.\n\nHowever, if the in-plane direction is no longer infinite, but confined, its electronic structure would change. They are referred to as [[graphene nanoribbon]]s. If it is \"zig-zag\", the bandgap would still be zero. If it is \"armchair\", the bandgap would be non-zero.\n\nGraphene's hexagonal lattice can be regarded as two interleaving triangular lattices. This perspective was successfully used to calculate the band structure for a single graphite layer using a tight-binding approximation.<ref name=coop2012/>\n\n====Electronic spectrum====\n\nElectrons propagating through graphene's honeycomb lattice effectively lose their mass, producing [[quasi-particle]]s that are described by a 2D analogue of the [[Dirac equation]] rather than the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particles.<ref name=\"Castro\" /><ref name=\"E-Phonon\">{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=yes |id=ammoVEI-H2gC}} |last1=Charlier |first1=J.-C. |last2=Eklund |first2=P.C. |last3=Zhu |first3=J. |last4=Ferrari |first4=A.C. |title=Electron and Phonon Properties of Graphene: Their Relationship with Carbon Nanotubes |work=Carbon Nanotubes: Advanced Topics in the Synthesis, Structure, Properties and Applications |editor1-first=A. |editor1-last=Jorio |editor2-first=G. |editor2-last=Dresselhaus |editor3-first=M.S. |editor3-last=Dresselhaus |editor-link3=Mildred Dresselhaus|location=Berlin/Heidelberg |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n====Dispersion relation====\n\n[[File:Graphene and Dirac Cones.ogv|thumb |Electronic band structure and Dirac cones, with effect of [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}|220x220px]]\n\nThe cleavage technique led directly to the first observation of the anomalous quantum Hall effect in graphene in 2005, by Geim's group and by [[Philip Kim]] and [[Yuanbo Zhang]].  This effect provided direct evidence of graphene's theoretically predicted [[Berry's phase]] of massless [[Dirac fermion]]s and the first proof of the Dirac fermion nature of electrons.<ref name=novo2005/><ref name=zhang2005/> These effects had been observed in bulk graphite by [[Yakov Kopelevich]], [[Igor A.

With one ''p''<sub>z</sub> electron per atom in this model the valence band is fully occupied, while the conduction band is vacant. The two bands touch at the zone corners (the ''K'' point in the Brillouin zone), where there is a zero density of states but no band gap. The graphene sheet thus displays a semimetallic (or zero-gap semiconductor) character, although the same cannot be said of a graphene sheet rolled into a [[carbon nanotube]], due to its curvature.

This nonlinear optical behavior is termed [[saturable absorption]] and the threshold value is called the saturation fluence. Graphene can be saturated readily under strong excitation over the visible to [[near-infrared]] region, due to the universal optical absorption and zero band gap. This has relevance for the mode locking of [[fiber laser]]s, where fullband mode locking has been achieved by graphene-based saturable absorber. Due to this special property, graphene has wide application in ultrafast [[photonics]].

Although the amplitude of these fluctuations is bounded in 3D structures (even in the limit of infinite size), the [[Mermin\u2013Wagner theorem]] shows that the amplitude of long-wavelength fluctuations grows logarithmically with the scale of a 2D structure, and would therefore be unbounded in structures of infinite size. Local deformation and elastic strain are negligibly affected by this long-range divergence in relative displacement. It is believed that a sufficiently large 2D structure, in the absence of applied lateral tension, will bend and crumple to form a fluctuating 3D structure. Researchers have observed ripples in suspended layers of graphene,<ref name=meyer2007/> and it has been proposed that the ripples are caused by thermal fluctuations in the material.

To emulate the growth mechanism of CVD, they first randomly selected [[nucleation]] sites that are at least 5A (arbitrarily chosen) apart from other sites. Polycrystalline graphene was generated from these nucleation sites and was subsequently annealed at 3000K, then quenched. Based on this model, they found that cracks are initiated at grain-boundary junctions, but the grain size does not significantly affect the strength.<ref name=\":9\" /> Second, in 2013, Z. Song et al. used MD simulations to study the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene with uniform-sized hexagon-shaped grains. The hexagon grains were oriented in various lattice directions and the GBs consisted of only heptagon, pentagon, and hexagonal carbon rings. The motivation behind such model was that similar systems had been experimentally observed in graphene flakes grown on the surface of liquid copper. While they also noted that crack is typically initiated at the triple junctions, they found that as the grain size decreases, the yield strength of graphene increases. Based on this finding, they proposed that polycrystalline follows pseudo [[Hall-Petch relationship]].<ref name=\":10\" /> Third, in 2013, Z. D. Sha et al. studied the effect of grain size on the properties of polycrystalline graphene, by modelling the grain patches using [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi construction]]. The GBs in this model consisted of heptagon, pentagon, and hexagon, as well as squares, octagons, and vacancies. Through MD simulation, contrary to the fore-mentioned study, they found inverse Hall-Petch relationship, where the strength of graphene increases as the grain size increases.<ref name=\":11\" /> Experimental observations and other theoretical predictions also gave differing conclusions, similar to the three given above.<ref name=\":8\" /> Such discrepancies show the complexity of the effects that grain size, arrangements of defects, and the nature of defects have on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene.\n\n===Chemical===\nGraphene has a theoretical [[specific surface area]] (SSA) of {{val|2630 |ul=m2 |up=g}}.

First, microcrystalline graphite is treated with an acidic mixture of sulfuric acid and [[nitric acid]]. A series of oxidation and exfoliation steps produce small graphene plates with [[carboxyl]] groups at their edges. These are converted to [[acid chloride]] groups by treatment with [[thionyl chloride]]; next, they are converted to the corresponding graphene [[amide]] via treatment with octadecylamine.

H. Adamson, graphene can be produced from natural graphite while preserving the integrity of the sheets using solvent interface trapping method (SITM). SITM use a high energy interface, such as oil and water, to exfoliate graphite to graphene. Stacked graphite delaminates, or spreads, at the oil/water interface to produce few-layer graphene in a thermodynamically favorable process in much the same way as small molecule surfactants spread to minimize the interfacial energy. In this way, graphene behaves like a 2D surfactant.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Woltornist |first1=Steven J. |last2=Alamer |first2=Fahad Alhashmi |last3=McDannald |first3=Austin |last4=Jain |first4=Menka |last5=Sotzing |first5=Gregory A. |last6=Adamson |first6=Douglas H. |date=2015-01-01 |title=Preparation of conductive graphene/graphite infused fabrics using an interface trapping method |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622314008719 |journal=Carbon |language=en |volume=81 |pages=38\u201342 |doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2014.09.020 |issn=0008-6223}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Woltornist |first1=Steven J. |last2=Carrillo |first2=Jan-Michael Y. |last3=Xu |first3=Thomas O. |last4=Dobrynin |first4=Andrey V. |last5=Adamson |first5=Douglas H. |date=2015-02-10 |title=Polymer/Pristine Graphene Based Composites: From Emulsions to Strong, Electrically Conducting Foams |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ma5024236 |journal=Macromolecules |language=en |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=687\u2013693 |doi=10.1021/ma5024236 |bibcode=2015MaMol..48..687W |osti=1265313 |issn=0024-9297}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=Shawn P. |last2=Abeykoon |first2=Prabodha G. |last3=McDermott |first3=Sean T. |last4=Adamson |first4=Douglas H. |date=2020-09-08 |title=Effect of Aqueous Anions on Graphene Exfoliation |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c01569 |journal=Langmuir |language=en |volume=36 |issue=35 |pages=10421\u201310428 |doi=10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c01569 |pmid=32794716 |s2cid=225385130 |issn=0743-7463}}</ref> SITM has been reported for a variety of applications such conductive polymer-graphene foams,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bento |first1=Jennifer L. |last2=Brown |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Woltornist |first3=Steven J. |last4=Adamson |first4=Douglas H. |date=January 2017 |title=Thermal and Electrical Properties of Nanocomposites Based on Self\u2010Assembled Pristine Graphene |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.201604277 |journal=Advanced Functional Materials |language=en |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1604277 |doi=10.1002/adfm.201604277 |s2cid=102395615 |issn=1616-301X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Woltornist |first1=Steven J. |last2=Varghese |first2=Deepthi |last3=Massucci |first3=Daniel |last4=Cao |first4=Zhen |last5=Dobrynin |first5=Andrey V. |last6=Adamson |first6=Douglas H. |date=May 2017 |title=Controlled 3D Assembly of Graphene Sheets to Build Conductive, Chemically Selective and Shape\u2010Responsive Materials |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201604947 |journal=Advanced Materials |language=en |volume=29 |issue=18 |pages=1604947 |doi=10.1002/adma.201604947 |pmid=28262992 |bibcode=2017AdM....2904947W |s2cid=205274548 |issn=0935-9648}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Varghese |first1=Deepthi |last2=Bento |first2=Jennifer L. |last3=Ward |first3=Shawn P. |last4=Adamson |first4=Douglas H. |date=2020-06-16 |title=Self-Assembled Graphene Composites for Flow-Through Filtration |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.0c05831 |journal=ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces |volume=12 |issue=26 |language=en |pages=29692\u201329699 |doi=10.1021/acsami.0c05831 |pmid=32492330 |s2cid=219316507 |issn=1944-8244}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Elizabeth E.
