It is a type of generative model that can create 3D scenes from a set of 2D images.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hackaday.com/2022/11/30/nerf-neural-radiance-fields/|title=NERF \u2013 Neural Radiance Fields |first=Anne|last=Ogborn|date=30 November 2022|website=[[Hackaday]]}}</ref>The NeRF model can learn the scene geometry, camera poses, and the [[reflectance]] properties of objects in a scene, which allows it to render new views of the scene from novel viewpoints.{{cn}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{uncategorized}}\n{{Drafts moved from mainspace|date=January 2023}}"}
