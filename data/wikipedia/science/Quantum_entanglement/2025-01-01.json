The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between [[classical physics]] and [[quantum physics]]: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.<ref name=\"horodecki2007\"/>{{rp|867|q=In this way entanglement is that feature of quantum formalism which makes it impossible to simulate quantum correlations within any classical formalism.}}\n\n[[Measurement#Quantum mechanics|Measurements]] of [[physical properties]] such as [[position (vector)|position]], [[momentum]], [[Spin (physics)|spin]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly [[correlated]]. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly [[paradox]]ical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible [[wave function collapse]] of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky]], and [[Nathan Rosen]],<ref name=\"Einstein1935\">\n{{cite journal\n | last1      = Einstein | first1     = Albert | author-link1 = Albert Einstein\n | last2      = Podolsky | first2     = Boris  | author-link2 = Boris Podolsky\n | last3      = Rosen    | first3     = Nathan | author-link3 = Nathan Rosen\n | year=1935\n | title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?\n | journal=Phys.

To avoid such action at a distance they have to attribute, to the space-time regions in question, real properties in advance of observation, correlated properties, which predetermine the outcomes of these particular observations. Since these real properties, fixed in advance of observation, are not contained in quantum formalism, that formalism for EPR is incomplete. It may be correct, as far as it goes, but the usual quantum formalism cannot be the whole story.\" And again on p. 144 Bell says: \"Einstein had no difficulty accepting that affairs in different places could be correlated. What he could not accept was that an intervention at one place could influence, immediately, affairs at the other.\" Downloaded 5 July 2011 from {{cite book |year=1987 |access-date=14 June 2014 |title=Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics |first=J.

During these debates, Einstein introduced a [[thought experiment]] about a box that emits a photon. He noted that the experimenter's choice of what measurement to make upon the box will change what can be predicted about the photon, even if the photon is very far away. This argument, which Einstein had formulated by 1931, was an early recognition of the phenomenon that would later be called entanglement.<ref>{{cite book|first=Don |last=Howard |chapter=''Nicht Sein Kann Was Nicht Sein Darf'', or The Prehistory of EPR, 1909\u20131935: Einstein's Early Worries About The Quantum Mechanics of Composite Systems |title=Sixty-Two Years of Uncertainty |editor-first=A.

The decay events obey the various [[conservation laws]], and as a result, the measurement outcomes of one daughter particle must be highly correlated with the measurement outcomes of the other daughter particle (so that the total momenta, angular momenta, energy, and so forth remains roughly the same before and after this process). For instance, a [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-zero particle could decay into a pair of spin-1/2 particles. Since the total spin before and after this decay must be zero (by the [[conservation of angular momentum]]), whenever the first particle is measured to be [[Spin (physics)#Direction|spin up]] on some axis, the other, when measured on the same axis, is always found to be [[Spin (physics)#Direction|spin down]]. This is called the spin anti-correlated case; and if the prior probabilities for measuring each spin are equal, the pair is said to be in the [[singlet state]].<ref name=\"Zwiebach2022\">{{cite book|first=Barton |last=Zwiebach |title=Mastering Quantum Mechanics: Essentials, Theory, and Applications |author-link=Barton Zwiebach |publisher=MIT Press |year=2022 |isbn=978-0-262-04613-8}}</ref>{{rp|\u00a718.8}} Perfect anti-correlations like this could be explained by \"hidden variables\" within the particles. For example, we could hypothesize that the particles are made in pairs such that one carries a value of \"up\" while the other carries a value of \"down\". Then, knowing the result of the spin measurement upon one particle, we could predict that the other will have the opposite value. Bell illustrated this with a story about a colleague, Bertlmann, who always wore socks with mismatching colors. \"Which colour he will have on a given foot on a given day is quite unpredictable,\" Bell wrote, but upon observing \"that the first sock is pink you can be already sure that the second sock will not be pink.\"<ref>{{cite journal|first=J. |last=Bell |title=Bertlmann's Socks and the Nature of Reality |journal=Journal de Physique Colloques |year=1981 |volume=42 (C2) |pages=41\u201362 |doi=10.1051/jphyscol:1981202 |url=https://hal.science/jpa-00220688v1}}</ref> Revealing the remarkable features of quantum entanglement requires considering multiple distinct experiments, such as spin measurements along different axes, and comparing the correlations obtained in these different configurations.<ref name=\"Zwiebach2022\"/>{{rp|\u00a718.8}}\n\nQuantum [[physical system|systems]] can become entangled through various types of interactions.

However, not all states of the composite system are separable. Fix a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] <math> \\{|i \\rangle_A\\}</math> for {{mvar|H<sub>A</sub>}} and a basis <math> \\{|j \\rangle_B\\}</math> for {{mvar|H<sub>B</sub>}}. The most general state in {{math|''H<sub>A</sub>'' \u2297 ''H<sub>B</sub>''}} is of the form\n: <math>|\\psi\\rangle_{AB} = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} |i\\rangle_A \\otimes |j\\rangle_B</math>.\n\nThis state is separable if there exist vectors <math> [c^A_i], [c^B_j]</math> so that <math> c_{ij}= c^A_i c^B_j,</math> yielding <math display=\"inline\"> |\\psi\\rangle_A = \\sum_{i} c^A_{i} |i\\rangle_A</math> and <math display=\"inline\"> |\\phi\\rangle_B = \\sum_{j} c^B_{j} |j\\rangle_B.</math> It is inseparable if for any vectors <math> [c^A_i],[c^B_j]</math> at least for one pair of coordinates <math> c^A_i,c^B_j</math> we have <math> c_{ij} \\neq c^A_ic^B_j.</math> If a state is inseparable, it is called an 'entangled state'.<ref name=\"Rieffel2011\"/>{{rp|218}}<ref name=\"Zwiebach2022\"/>{{rp|\u00a71.5}}\n\nFor example, given two basis vectors <math> \\{|0\\rangle_A, |1\\rangle_A\\}</math> of {{mvar|H<sub>A</sub>}} and two basis vectors <math> \\{|0\\rangle_B, |1\\rangle_B\\}</math> of {{mvar|H<sub>B</sub>}}, the following is an entangled state:\n: <math>\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left ( |0\\rangle_A \\otimes |1\\rangle_B - |1\\rangle_A \\otimes |0\\rangle_B \\right ).</math>\n\nIf the composite system is in this state, it is impossible to attribute to either system {{mvar|A}} or system {{mvar|B}} a definite [[pure state]]. Another way to say this is that while the [[von Neumann entropy]] of the whole state is zero (as it is for any pure state), the entropy of the subsystems is greater than zero. In this sense, the systems are \"entangled\". The above example is one of four [[Bell states]], which are (maximally) entangled pure states (pure states of the {{math|''H<sub>A</sub>'' \u2297 ''H<sub>B</sub>''}} space, but which cannot be separated into pure states of each {{mvar|H<sub>A</sub>}} and {{mvar|H<sub>B</sub>}}).<ref name=\"Zwiebach2022\"/>{{rp|\u00a718.6}}\n\nNow suppose Alice is an observer for system {{mvar|A}}, and Bob is an observer for system {{mvar|B}}. If in the entangled state given above Alice makes a measurement in the <math> \\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}</math> eigenbasis of {{mvar|A}}, there are two possible outcomes, occurring with equal probability: Alice can obtain the outcome 0, or she can obtain the outcome 1. If she obtains the outcome 0, then she can predict with certainty that Bob's result will be 1. Likewise, if she obtains the outcome 1, then she can predict with certainty that Bob's result will be 0. In other words, the results of measurements on the two qubits will be perfectly anti-correlated. This remains true even if the systems {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are spatially separated. This is the foundation of the EPR paradox.<ref name=\"Nielsen-2010\" />{{Rp|pages=113\u2013114}}\n\nThe outcome of Alice's measurement is random. Alice cannot decide which state to collapse the composite system into, and therefore cannot transmit information to Bob by acting on her system. Causality is thus preserved, in this particular scheme. For the general argument, see [[no-communication theorem]].\n\n=== Ensembles ===\nAs mentioned above, a state of a quantum system is given by a unit vector in a Hilbert space. More generally, if one has less information about the system, then one calls it an 'ensemble' and describes it by a [[density matrix]], which is a [[positive-semidefinite matrix]], or a [[trace class]] when the state space is infinite-dimensional, and which has trace 1. Again, by the [[spectral theorem]], such a matrix takes the general form:\n: <math>\\rho = \\sum_i w_i |\\alpha_i\\rangle \\langle\\alpha_i|,</math>\nwhere the ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> are positive-valued probabilities (they sum up to 1), the vectors {{math|''\u03b1''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are unit vectors, and in the infinite-dimensional case, we would take the closure of such states in the trace norm. We can interpret {{mvar|\u03c1}} as representing an ensemble where <math> w_i </math> is the proportion of the ensemble whose states are <math>|\\alpha_i\\rangle</math>. When a mixed state has rank 1, it therefore describes a 'pure ensemble'. When there is less than total information about the state of a quantum system we need [[#Reduced density matrices|density matrices]] to represent the state.<ref name=\"Peres1993\"/>{{rp|73\u201374}}<ref name=\"Holevo2001\"/>{{rp|13\u201315}}<ref name=\"Zwiebach2022\"/>{{rp|\u00a722.2}}\n\nExperimentally, a mixed ensemble might be realized as follows. Consider a \"black box\" apparatus that spits [[electron]]s towards an observer. The electrons' Hilbert spaces are [[identical particles|identical]]. The apparatus might produce electrons that are all in the same state; in this case, the electrons received by the observer are then a pure ensemble. However, the apparatus could produce electrons in different states. For example, it could produce two populations of electrons: one with state <math>|\\mathbf{z}+\\rangle</math> with spins aligned in the positive {{math|'''z'''}} direction, and the other with state <math>|\\mathbf{y}-\\rangle</math> with spins aligned in the negative {{math|'''y'''}} direction. Generally, this is a mixed ensemble, as there can be any number of populations, each corresponding to a different state.\n\nFollowing the definition above, for a bipartite composite system, mixed states are just density matrices on {{math|''H<sub>A</sub>'' \u2297 ''H<sub>B</sub>''}}. That is, it has the general form\n: <math>\\rho =\\sum_{i} w_i\\left[\\sum_{j} \\bar{c}_{ij} (|\\alpha_{ij}\\rangle\\otimes|\\beta_{ij}\\rangle)\\right]\\left[\\sum_k c_{ik} (\\langle\\alpha_{ik}|\\otimes\\langle\\beta_{ik}|)\\right]\n</math>\nwhere the ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> are positively valued probabilities, <math display=\"inline\">\\sum_j |c_{ij}|^2=1</math>, and the vectors are unit vectors. This is self-adjoint and positive and has trace 1.\n\nExtending the definition of separability from the pure case, we say that a mixed state is separable if it can be written as<ref name=Laloe>{{cite journal|last=Laloe|first=Franck|year=2001|title=Do We Really Understand Quantum Mechanics|journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=69 |issue=6|pages=655\u2013701 |arxiv=quant-ph/0209123 |bibcode=2001AmJPh..69..655L |doi=10.1119/1.1356698|s2cid=123349369 }}</ref>{{rp|131\u2013132}}\n: <math>\\rho = \\sum_i w_i \\rho_i^A \\otimes \\rho_i^B, </math>\nwhere the {{math|''w''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are positively valued probabilities and the <math>\\rho_i^A</math>s and <math>\\rho_i^B</math>s are themselves mixed states (density operators) on the subsystems {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} respectively. In other words, a state is separable if it is a probability distribution over uncorrelated states, or product states. By writing the density matrices as sums of pure ensembles and expanding, we may assume without loss of generality that <math>\\rho_i^A</math> and <math>\\rho_i^B</math> are themselves pure ensembles. A state is then said to be entangled if it is not separable.\n\nIn general, finding out whether or not a mixed state is entangled is considered difficult.

Two maximally entangled states of two qubits are used up in this process. Thus entangled states are a resource that enables the realization of quantum interactions (or of quantum channels) in a setting where only LOCC are available, but they are consumed in the process.

One method to quantify this value is to use an [[#Entanglement measures|entanglement measure]] that assigns a numerical value to each quantum state. However, it is often interesting to settle for a coarser way to compare quantum states. This gives rise to different classification schemes. Most entanglement classes are defined based on whether states can be converted to other states using LOCC or a subclass of these operations. The smaller the set of allowed operations, the finer the classification. Important examples are:\n* If two states can be transformed into each other by a local unitary operation, they are said to be in the same ''LU class''. This is the finest of the usually considered classes. Two states in the same LU class have the same value for entanglement measures and the same value as a resource in the distant-labs setting. There is an infinite number of different LU classes (even in the simplest case of two qubits in a pure state).<ref name=\"GRB1998\">{{cite journal |author1=Grassl, M. |author2=R\u00f6tteler, M. |author3=Beth, T. |title=Computing local invariants of quantum-bit systems |journal=Phys.
