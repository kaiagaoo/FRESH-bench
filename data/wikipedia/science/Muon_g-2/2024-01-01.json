The technique involved storing 3.094&nbsp;[[GeV]] muons in a uniform measured magnetic field and observing the difference of the muon spin precession and rotation frequency via detection of the muon decay electrons. The advance in precision relied crucially on a much more intense beam than was available at CERN and the injection of muons into the storage ring, whereas the previous CERN experiments had injected pions into the storage ring, of which only a small fraction decay into muons that are stored. The experiment used a much more uniform magnetic field using a superferric superconducting storage ring magnet, a passive superconducting inflector magnet, fast muon kickers to deflect the injected muons onto stored orbits, a beam tube NMR trolley that could map the magnetic field in the storage region, and numerous other experimental advances.

The initial and final legs were on a special truck traveling closed highways at night.\n\nThe Muon {{mvar|g}}{{nnbsp}}\u2212{{nnbsp}}2 experiment injected 3.1 GeV/c polarized muons produced at the Fermilab Muon Campus into the storage ring that was significantly upgraded from the Brookhaven experiment.\n\n[[File:PbF2 Crystal SIPM.png|left|thumb|Sample 25&nbsp;mm \u00d7 25&nbsp;mm \u00d7 140&nbsp;mm [[lead(II) fluoride|PbF{{sub|2}}]] crystals (bare and wrapped in Millipore paper) are pictured together with a 16&nbsp;channel monolithic Hamamatsu SiPM.]]\n\n===Detectors===\nThe magnetic moment measurement is realized by 24&nbsp;electromagnetic [[Calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimetric detectors]], which are distributed uniformly on the inside of the storage ring. The calorimeters measure the energy and time of arrival (relative to the injection time) of the decay positrons (and their count) from the muon [[Particle decay|decay]] in the storage ring. After a muon decays into a positron and two neutrinos, the positron ends up with less energy than the original muon. Thus, the magnetic field curls it inward where it hits a segmented [[lead(II) fluoride]] (PbF{{sub|2}}) calorimeter read out by silicon [[Photomultiplier|photo-multipliers]] (SiPM).<ref name=\"TDR\">{{cite report |last1=Grange |first1=J. |last2=Guarino |first2=V. |last3=Winter |first3=P. |last4=Wood |first4=K. |last5=Zhao |first5=H. |last6=Carey |first6=R.M. |last7=Gastler |first7=D. |last8=Hazen |first8=E. |last9=Kinnaird |first9=N. |collaboration=Muon {{mvar|g}} \u2212 2 Collaboration |display-authors=6 |date=January 27, 2015 |title=Muon ({{mvar|g}} \u2212 2) Technical Design Report |arxiv=1501.06858 |bibcode=2015arXiv150106858G }} {{cite web |url=http://inspirehep.net/record/1341289 |title=alt. source |via=inSPIRE}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Particle detector|tracking detectors]] register the trajectory of the positrons from the muon decay in the storage ring. The tracker can provide a muon [[electric dipole moment]] measurement, but not directly the magnetic moment measurement. The main purpose of the tracker is to measure the muon beam profile, as well as resolution of pile-up of events (for reduction of the systematic uncertainty in the calorimeter measurement).<ref name=TDR/>\n\n[[File:Tracker g-2.jpg|thumb|One of the 4&nbsp;rows of 32&nbsp;straws is shown. A straw (length of 100&nbsp;mm, and diameter of 5&nbsp;mm) acts like an [[ionisation chamber]] filled with 1:1 [[argon]]:[[ethane]], with a central cathode wire at +1.6&nbsp;kV.]]\n\n===Magnetic field===\nTo measure the magnetic moment to [[Parts-per notation|ppb]] level of precision requires a uniform average magnetic field to be of the same level precision. The experimental goal of {{mvar|g}}{{nnbsp}}\u2212{{nnbsp}}2 is to achieve an uncertainty level on the magnetic field to 70&nbsp;ppb averaged over time and muon distribution. A uniform field of {{val|1.45|ul=T}} is created in the storage ring using superconducting magnets, and the field value will be actively mapped throughout the ring using an [[NMR]] probe on a mobile trolley (without breaking the vacuum). Calibration of the trolley is referenced to the [[Larmor frequency]] of a proton in a spherical water sample at a reference temperature (34.7&nbsp;\u00b0C), and is cross-calibrated to a novel [[helium-3]] magnetometer.<ref name=TDR/>\n\n===Data acquisition===\nAn essential component of the experiment is the [[data acquisition]] (DAQ) system, which manages the data flow from the detector electronics. The requirement for the experiment is to acquire raw data at a rate of 18&nbsp;GB/s. This is accomplished by employing parallel data-processing architecture using 24&nbsp;high-speed [[Graphics processing unit|GPUs]] (NVIDIA Tesla K40) to process data from 12&nbsp;bit waveform digitisers. The set-up is controlled by the MIDAS DAQ software framework. The DAQ system processes data from 1296&nbsp;calorimeter channels, 3&nbsp;straw tracker stations, and auxiliary detectors (e.g. entrance muon counters). The total data output of the experiment is estimated at 2&nbsp;[[byte|PB]].<ref>{{cite conference |last=Gohn |first=W. |collaboration=Muon {{mvar|g}} \u2212 2 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |date=November 15, 2016 |title=Data acquisition with GPUs: The DAQ for the muon {{mvar|g}} \u2212 2 experiment at Fermilab |book-title=Proceedings, 38th International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP 2016): Chicago, Illinois, USA, August 3\u201310, 2016 |page=174 |arxiv=1611.04959 |doi=10.22323/1.282.0174 |bibcode=2016arXiv161104959G |doi-access=free }} {{cite web |url=http://inspirehep.net/record/1498145 |title=alt. source |via=inSPIRE}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Collaboration==\nThe following universities, laboratories, and companies are participating in the experiment:<ref>{{cite web |title=Muon {{mvar|g}} \u2212 2 Collaboration |website=Muon {{mvar|g}} \u2212 2 Experiment |publisher=Fermilab |lang=en |url=http://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/collaboration.html |access-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n\n===Universities===\n*[[Boston University]]\n*[[Cornell University]]\n*[[Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]]\n*[[University of Chicago]]\n*[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]\n*[[James Madison University]]\n*Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ([[KAIST]])\n*[[University of Kentucky]]\n*[[University of Liverpool]]\n*[[Lancaster University]]\n*[[University College London]]\n*[[University of Manchester]]\n*[[University of Massachusetts]]\n*[[Michigan State University]]\n*[[University of Michigan]]\n*[[University of Mississippi]]\n*[[University of Molise|Universit\u00e0 del Molise]]\n*[[University of Naples Federico II|Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II]]\n*[[North Central College]]\n*[[Northern Illinois University]]\n*[[Regis University]]\n*[[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]\n*[[Technische Universitat Dresden]]\n*[[University of Udine|Universit\u00e0 di Udine]]\n*[[University of Virginia]]\n*[[University of Washington]]\n\n===Laboratories===\n*[[Argonne National Laboratory]]\n*[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]\n*[[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]\n*[[Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics]]\n*[[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare]]\n*[[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research|Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna]]\n*[[Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati]]\n*[[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare|INFN, Sezione di Napoli]]\n*[[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare|INFN, Sezione di Pisa]]\n*[[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare|INFN, Sezione di Roma Tor Vergata]]\n*[[Institute for Basic Science]], S.
