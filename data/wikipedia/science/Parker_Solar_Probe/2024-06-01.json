It will assess the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal plasma and magnetic field, the energy flow that heats the solar corona and impels the solar wind, and the mechanisms that accelerate energetic particles.\n\nThe spacecraft's systems are protected from the extreme heat and radiation near the [[Sun]] by a solar shield. Incident solar radiation at perihelion is approximately {{val|{{#expr:475*1.361 round -1}}|u=kW |up=m2}}, or 475 times the [[solar constant|intensity at Earth orbit]].{{r|extreme|Fox 2016|p2=31}} The solar shield is hexagonal, mounted on the Sun-facing side of the spacecraft, {{cvt|2.3|m}} in diameter,{{r|jhuapl}} {{cvt|11.4|cm}} thick, and is made of two panels of [[reinforced carbon\u2013carbon]] composite with a lightweight {{convert|4.5|in|cm|disp=flip|sp=us|adj=mid|-thick}} carbon foam core,<ref name=\"svs\">{{cite web |title=GMS: Cutting-Edge Heat Shield Installed on NASA's Parker Solar Probe |url=https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/12992 |website=svs.gsfc.nasa.gov |access-date=4 November 2022 |language=en |date=5 July 2018}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> which is designed to withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft of about {{cvt|2500|F|C|order=flip}}.<ref name=extreme/> The shield weighs only {{convert|160|lbs|kg|order=flip}} and keeps the spacecraft's instruments at {{cvt|85|F|C|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"svs\"/>\n\nA white reflective [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] surface layer minimizes absorption. The spacecraft systems and [[scientific instrument]]s are located in the central portion of the shield's shadow, where direct radiation from the Sun is fully blocked. If the shield were not between the spacecraft and the Sun, the probe would be damaged and become inoperative within tens of seconds. As radio communication with Earth will take about eight minutes in each direction, the Parker Solar Probe has to act autonomously and rapidly to protect itself. This will be done using four light sensors to detect the first traces of direct [[sunlight]] coming from the shield limits and engaging movements from [[reaction wheel]]s to reposition the spacecraft within the shadow again. According to project scientist Nicky Fox, the team describe it as \"the most autonomous spacecraft that has ever flown\".{{r|bbc22jl18}}\n\nThe primary power for the mission is a dual system of [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] ([[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic arrays]]). A primary photovoltaic array, used for the portion of the mission outside {{Val|0.25|u=au}}, is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the Sun, and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach. This secondary array uses pumped-fluid cooling to maintain [[operating temperature]] of the solar panels and instrumentation.<ref>{{cite

The instrument suite captures the scale and shape of electric and magnetic fields in the Sun's atmosphere. FIELDS measures waves and turbulence in the inner heliosphere with high time resolution to understand the fields associated with waves, shocks and magnetic reconnection, a process by which magnetic field lines explosively realign. FIELDS measures the electric field around the spacecraft with five antennas, four of which stick out beyond the spacecraft's heat shield and into the sunlight, where they experience temperatures of {{convert|2500|F|C}}. The {{convert|2|m||adj=mid|-long|sp=us}} antennas are made of a [[niobium]] alloy, which can withstand extreme temperatures. FIELDS measures electric fields across a broad frequency range both directly and remotely. Operating in two modes, the four sunlit antennas measure the properties of the fast and slow solar wind \u2014 the flow of solar particles constantly streaming out from the Sun. The fifth antenna, which sticks out perpendicular to the others in the shade of the heat shield, helps make a three-dimensional picture of the electric field at higher frequencies. The suite also has three magnetometers to assess the magnetic field. A search coil magnetometer, or SCM, measures how the magnetic field changes over time. Two identical fluxgate magnetometers, MAGi and MAGo, measure the large-scale coronal magnetic field. The fluxgate magnetometers are specialized for measuring the magnetic field further from the Sun where it varies at a slower rate, while the search coil magnetometer is necessary closer to the Sun where the field changes quickly, as it can sample the magnetic field at a rate of two million times per second. The Principal Investigator is Stuart Bale at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=\"nasa-instruments\"/>\n* [[Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun|IS\u2609IS]] (Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun). The instrument uses two complementary instruments to measure particles across a wide range of energies. By measuring electrons, protons and ions, IS\u2609IS will understand the particles' lifecycles \u2014 where they came from, how they became accelerated and how they move out from the Sun through interplanetary space. The two energetic particle instruments on IS\u2609IS are called EPI-Lo and EPI-Hi (EPI stands for Energetic Particle Instrument). EPI-Lo measures the spectra of electrons and ions and identifies carbon, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, iron and two isotopes of helium, He-3 and He-4. Distinguishing between helium isotopes will help determine which of several theorized mechanisms caused the particles' acceleration. The instrument has a design with an octagonal dome body supporting 80 viewfinders. Multiple viewfinders provide a wide field of view to observe low-energy particles. An ion that enters EPI-Lo through one of the viewfinders first passes through two carbon-polyimide-aluminum foils and then encounters a solid-state detector. Upon impact, the foils produce electrons, which are measured by a microchannel plate. Using the amount of energy left by the ion's impact on the detector and the time it takes the ions to pass through the sensor identifies the species of the particles. EPI-Hi uses three particle sensors composed of stacked layers of detectors to measure particles with energies higher than those measured by EPI-Lo. The front few layers are composed of ultra-thin silicon detectors made up of geometric segments, which allows for the determination of the particle's direction and helps reduce background noise. Charged particles are identified by measuring how deep they travel into the stack of detectors and how many electrons they pull off atoms in each detector, a process called ionization. At closest approach to the Sun, EPI-Hi will be able to detect up to 100,000 particles per second.

These optical telescopes acquire images of the [[solar corona|corona]] and inner [[heliosphere]]. WISPR uses two cameras with radiation-hardened Active Pixel Sensor CMOS detectors. The camera's lenses are made of a radiation hard BK7, a common type of glass used for space telescopes, which is also sufficiently hardened against the impacts of dust. The Principal Investigator is Russell Howard at the [[Naval Research Laboratory]].<ref name=\"nasa-instruments\"/>\n* [[SWEAP]] (Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons). This investigation will count the electrons, protons and helium ions, and measure their properties such as velocity, density, and temperature. Its main instruments are the Solar Probe Analyzers (SPAN, two [[electrostatic analyzer]]s) and the Solar Probe Cup (SPC). SPC is a [[Faraday cup]], a metal device that can catch charged particles in a vacuum. Peeking over the heat shield to measure how electrons and ions are moving, the cup is exposed to the full light, heat and energy of the Sun. The cup is composed of a series of highly transparent grids \u2014 one of which uses variable high voltages to sort the particles \u2014 above several collector plates, which measure the particles' properties. The variable voltage grid also helps sort out background noise, such as cosmic rays and photoionized electrons, which could otherwise bias the measurements. The grids, located near the front of the instrument, can reach temperatures of {{convert|3000|F|C}}, glowing red while the instrument makes measurements. The instrument uses pieces of sapphire to electrically isolate different components within the cup. As it passes close to the Sun, SPC takes up to 146 measurements per second to accurately determine the velocity, density and temperature of the Sun's plasma. SPAN is composed of two instruments, SPAN-A and SPAN-B, which have wide fields of view to allow them to see the parts of space not observed by SPC. Particles encountering the detectors enter a maze that sends the particles through a series of deflectors and voltages to sort the particles based on their mass and charge. While SPAN-A has two components to measure both electrons and ions, SPAN-B looks only at electrons.

But during this part of each orbit, there are still periods when communication is not possible. First, the requirement that the heat shield of the probe be pointed towards the Sun sometimes puts the heat shield between the antenna and Earth. Second, even when the probe is not particularly near the Sun, when the angle between the probe and the Sun (as seen from Earth) is too small, the Sun's radiation can overwhelm the communication link.<ref name=\"mission design\"/>{{rp|11\u201314}}\n\nAfter the first [[Venus]] [[List of planetary flybys|flyby]], the probe was in an [[Elliptic orbit|elliptical orbit]] with a period of 150 days (two-thirds the period of Venus), making three orbits while Venus makes two. After the second flyby, the period shortened to 130 days. After less than two orbits (only 198 days later) it encountered Venus a third time at a point earlier in the orbit of Venus. This encounter shortened its period to half of that of Venus, or about 112.5 days. After two orbits it met Venus a fourth time at about the same place, shortening its period to about 102 days. After 237 days, it met Venus for the fifth time and its period was shortened to about 96 days, three-sevenths that of Venus. It then made seven orbits while Venus made three. The sixth encounter, almost two years after the fifth, shortened its period down to 92 days, two-fifths that of Venus. After five more orbits (two orbits of Venus), it will meet Venus for the seventh and last time, decreasing its period to 88 or 89 days and allowing it to approach closer to the [[Sun]].<ref name=the_mission>See data and figure at {{cite web|url=http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Journey-to-the-Sun|title=Solar Probe Plus: The Mission|date=2017|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory|access-date=June 17, 2017|archive-date=August 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822222954/http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Journey-to-the-Sun|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{wide image|Velocity of Parker Solar Probe wide.svg|900px|The speed of the probe and distance from the Sun, from launch until 2026|center|alt=}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border: none;\"\n|+ List of events{{r|the_mission}}{{r|Fox 2016|p=31}}<ref>{{cite web|title=HORIZONS System|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA|url=https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons|access-date=August 16, 2018|archive-date=May 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525123930/https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons|url-status=live}} [https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons_batch.cgi?batch=1&COMMAND='-96'&MAKE_EPHEM='YES'&TABLE_TYPE='VECTORS'&START_TIME='2018-Aug-12%2008:17'&STOP_TIME='2025-Aug-31%2009:18'&STEP_SIZE='1%20h'&CSV_FORMAT='YES'&CENTER='500@10'&REF_PLANE='ECLIPTIC'&REF_SYSTEM='J2000'&OUT_UNITS='AU-D'&VEC_TABLE='2'&OBJ_DATA='YES' Data file] {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n! rowspan=2 | Year !! rowspan=2 | Date !! rowspan=2 | Event !!
