These have stem-cell capability. ''[[In vivo]]'', they eventually differentiate into all of the body's cell types (making them [[pluripotent]]).

They exist to replenish rapidly lost cell types and are [[multipotent]] or unipotent, meaning they only differentiate into a few cell types or one type of cell. In mammals, they include, among others, [[hematopoietic stem cells]], which replenish blood and immune cells, [[Stratum basale|basal cells]], which maintain the skin [[epithelium]], and [[mesenchymal stem cells]], which maintain bone, [[cartilage]], muscle and fat cells.

They discovered the blood-forming stem cell, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), through their pioneering work in mice. McCulloch and Till began a series of experiments in which bone marrow cells were injected into irradiated mice. They observed lumps in the spleens of the mice that were linearly proportional to the number of bone marrow cells injected. They hypothesized that each lump (colony) was a clone arising from a single marrow cell (stem cell). In subsequent work, McCulloch and Till, joined by graduate student [[Andrew John Becker]] and senior scientist [[Louis Siminovitch]], confirmed that each lump did in fact arise from a single cell. Their results were published in ''Nature'' in 1963. In that same year, Siminovitch was a lead investigator for studies that found colony-forming cells were capable of self-renewal, which is a key defining property of stem cells that Till and McCulloch had theorized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.usask.ca/articles/research/2018/the-accidental-discovery-of-stem-cells.php|title =The Accidental Discovery of Stem Cells|last1=MacPherson|first1=Colleen|website=USask News|publisher=University of Saskatchewan|access-date=3 December 2019|ref=1|name-list-style=vanc}}</ref>\n\nThe first therapy using stem cells was a [[bone marrow transplant]] performed by French oncologist [[Georges Math\u00e9]] in 1958 on five workers at the [[Vin\u010da Nuclear Institute]] in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] who had been affected by a [[criticality accident]].

This allowed the formation of murine genetic models, a system in which the genes of mice are deleted or altered in order to study their function in pathology. By 1998, human embryonic stem cells were first isolated by American biologist [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]], which made it possible to have new transplantation methods or various cell types for testing new treatments.

In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either [[totipotency|totipotent]] or [[pluripotency|pluripotent]]\u2014to be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although [[multipotent]] or [[unipotent cell|unipotent]] [[progenitor cell]]s are sometimes referred to as stem cells. Apart from this, it is said that stem cell function is regulated in a feedback mechanism.\n\n===Self-renewal===\nTwo mechanisms ensure that a stem cell population is maintained (doesn't shrink in size):\n\n1. [[Asymmetric cell division]]: a stem cell divides into one mother cell, which is identical to the original stem cell, and another daughter cell, which is differentiated.\n\nWhen a stem cell self-renews, it divides and does not disrupt the undifferentiated state. This self-renewal demands control of cell cycle as well as upkeep of multipotency or pluripotency, which all depends on the stem cell.<ref>Shenghui, H. E., Nakada, D., & Morrison, S. J. (2009). Mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal. Annual Review of Cell and Developmental, 25, 377\u2013406.</ref>\n\n2. Stochastic differentiation: when one stem cell grows and divides into two differentiated daughter cells, another stem cell undergoes [[mitosis]] and produces two stem cells identical to the original.\n\nStem cells use [[telomerase]], a protein that restores [[telomeres]], to protect their DNA and extend their cell division limit (the [[Hayflick limit]]).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cong YS, Wright WE, Shay JW | title = Human telomerase and its regulation | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 407\u2013425, table of contents | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12208997 | pmc = 120798 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.66.3.407-425.2002 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Potency meaning===\n{{Main|Cell potency}}\n[[Image:Stem cells diagram.png|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Pluripotent, embryonic stem cells originate as inner cell mass (ICM) cells within a blastocyst.

In a somatic cell cycle, oscillatory activity of Cyclin-Cdk complexes is observed in sequential action, which controls crucial regulators of the cell cycle to induce unidirectional transitions between phases: [[Cyclin D]] and Cdk4/6 are active in the G1 phase, while [[Cyclin E]] and [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 2|Cdk2]] are active during the late G1 phase and S phase; and [[Cyclin A]] and Cdk2 are active in the S phase and G2, while [[Cyclin B]] and [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 1|Cdk1]] are active in G2 and M phase.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, in mESCs, this typically ordered and oscillatory activity of Cyclin-Cdk complexes is absent. Rather, the Cyclin E/Cdk2 complex is constitutively active throughout the cycle, keeping [[retinoblastoma protein]] (pRb) [[hyperphosphorylated]] and thus inactive. This allows for direct transition from M phase to the late G1 phase, leading to absence of D-type cyclins and therefore a shortened G1 phase.<ref name=\":1\" /> Cdk2 activity is crucial for both cell cycle regulation and cell-fate decisions in mESCs; downregulation of Cdk2 activity prolongs G1 phase progression, establishes a somatic cell-like cell cycle, and induces expression of differentiation markers.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koledova Z, Kafkova LR, Calabkova L, Krystof V, Dolezel P, Divoky V | title = Cdk2 inhibition prolongs G1 phase progression in mouse embryonic stem cells | journal = Stem Cells and Development | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 181\u2013194 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19737069 | doi = 10.1089/scd.2009.0065 }}</ref>\n\nIn human ESCs (hESCs), the duration of G1 is dramatically shortened.

Thus, similar to mESCs, hESCs show high Cdk activity, with Cdk2 exhibiting the highest kinase activity. Also similar to mESCs, hESCs demonstrate the importance of Cdk2 in G1 phase regulation by showing that G1 to S transition is delayed when Cdk2 activity is inhibited and G1 is arrest when Cdk2 is knocked down.<ref name=\":0\" /> However unlike mESCs, hESCs have a functional G1 phase. hESCs show that the activities of Cyclin E/Cdk2 and Cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes are cell cycle-dependent and the Rb checkpoint in G1 is functional.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nESCs are also characterized by G1 checkpoint non-functionality, even though the G1 checkpoint is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. In response to [[DNA damage]], ESCs do not stop in G1 to repair DNA damages but instead, depend on S and G2/M checkpoints or undergo apoptosis. The absence of G1 checkpoint in ESCs allows for the removal of cells with damaged DNA, hence avoiding potential mutations from inaccurate DNA repair.<ref name=\":0\" /> Consistent with this idea, ESCs are hypersensitive to DNA damage to minimize mutations passed onto the next generation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Fetal==\nThe primitive stem cells located in the organs of [[fetuses]] are referred to as fetal stem cells.<ref name=\"isbn981-256-126-9\">\n{{cite book |editor1=Ariff Bongso |editor2=Eng Hin Lee | title = Stem Cells: From Benchtop to Bedside |url=https://archive.org/details/stemcellsfromben00bong |url-access=limited | chapter = Stem cells: their definition, classification and sources | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2005 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stemcellsfromben00bong/page/n25 5] | isbn = 978-981-256-126-8 | oclc = 443407924 }}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of fetal stem cells:\n\n# Fetal proper stem cells come from the tissue of the fetus proper and are generally obtained after an [[abortion]].

Surgical processes by their character are harmful. Tissue has to be dropped as a way to reach a successful outcome. One may prevent the dangers of surgical interventions using stem cells. Additionally, there's a possibility of disease, and whether the procedure fails, further surgery may be required. Risks associated with anesthesia can also be eliminated with stem cells.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Comprehensive Stem Cell Training Course|url=https://r3medicaltraining.com/events/comprehensive-stem-cell-training-course/|access-date=2021-05-15|website=R3 Medical Training|language=en-US}}</ref> On top of that, stem cells have been harvested from the patient's body and redeployed in which they're wanted. Since they come from the patient's own body, this is referred to as an autologous treatment. Autologous remedies are thought to be the safest because there's likely zero probability of donor substance rejection.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nStem cell treatments may require [[immunosuppression]] because of a requirement for radiation before the transplant to remove the person's previous cells, or because the patient's immune system may target the stem cells. One approach to avoid the second possibility is to use stem cells from the same patient who is being treated.\n\nPluripotency in certain stem cells could also make it difficult to obtain a specific cell type. It is also difficult to obtain the exact cell type needed, because not all cells in a population differentiate uniformly. Undifferentiated cells can create tissues other than desired types.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Moore KL, Persaud TV, Torchia MG | title = Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology and Birth Defects. | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Saunders, Elsevier | date = 2013 }}</ref>\n\nSome stem cells form tumors after transplantation;<ref name = \"usn2009\">Bernadine Healy, M.D..
