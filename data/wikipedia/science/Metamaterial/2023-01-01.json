Karl Ferdinand Lindman studied [[Dispersion (optics)|wave interaction]] with metallic [[helices]] as artificial [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral media]] in the early twentieth century.\n\nIn the late 1940s, [[Winston E. Kock]] from [[AT&T Bell Laboratories]] developed materials that had similar characteristics to metamaterials. In the 1950s and 1960s, artificial [[dielectric]]s were studied for lightweight [[microwave antenna]]s. Microwave [[Radar-absorbent material|radar absorbers]] were researched in the 1980s and 1990s as applications for artificial chiral media.<ref name=metamaterialplasmonics1/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zharov A.

He showed that the [[phase velocity]] could be made anti-parallel to the direction of [[Poynting vector]]. This is contrary to [[wave propagation]] in naturally occurring materials.<ref name=\"Veselago1\" />\n\nIn 1995, John M. Guerra fabricated a sub-wavelength transparent grating (later called a photonic metamaterial)  having 50&nbsp;nm lines and spaces, and then coupled it with a standard oil immersion microscope objective (the combination later called a super-lens) to resolve a grating in a silicon wafer also having 50&nbsp;nm lines and spaces. This super-resolved image was achieved with illumination having a wavelength of 650&nbsp;nm in air.<ref name=\"Guerra 3555\u20133557\"/>\n\nIn 2000, [[John Pendry]] was the first to identify a practical way to make a left-handed metamaterial, a material in which the [[right-hand rule]] is not followed.<ref name=\"slyusarmeta\" /> Such a material allows an electromagnetic wave to convey energy (have a [[group velocity]]) against its [[phase velocity]]. Pendry's idea was that metallic wires aligned along the direction of a wave could provide negative [[permittivity]] ([[dielectric function]] \u03b5 < 0). Natural materials (such as [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectrics]]) display negative permittivity; the challenge was achieving negative permeability (\u00b5 < 0). In 1999 Pendry demonstrated that a split ring (C shape) with its axis placed along the direction of wave propagation could do so. In the same paper, he showed that a periodic array of wires and rings could give rise to a negative refractive index. Pendry also proposed a related negative-permeability design, the [[Swiss roll (metamaterial)|Swiss roll]].\n\nIn 2000, [[David R. Smith (physicist)|David R.

A gyrotropic material is one that has been altered by the presence of a quasistatic [[magnetic field]], enabling a [[magneto-optic effect]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} A magneto-optic effect is a phenomenon in which an electromagnetic wave propagates through such a medium. In such a material, left- and right-rotating elliptical polarizations can propagate at different speeds. When light is transmitted through a layer of magneto-optic material, the result is called the [[Faraday effect]]: the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] plane can be rotated, forming a [[Faraday rotator]]. The results of such a reflection are known as the [[magneto-optic Kerr effect]] (not to be confused with the [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear]] [[Kerr effect]]). Two gyrotropic materials with reversed rotation directions of the two principal polarizations are called [[optical isomers]].\n\nJoining a slab of ENG material and slab of MNG material resulted in properties such as resonances, anomalous tunneling, transparency and zero reflection. Like negative-index materials, SNGs are innately dispersive, so their \u03b5<small>r</small>, \u00b5<small>r</small> and refraction index n, are a function of frequency.<ref name=snglhm/>\n\n=== Hyperbolic ===\nHyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) behave as a metal for certain polarization or direction of light propagation and behave as a dielectric for the other due to the negative and positive permittivity tensor components, giving extreme [[anisotropy]].

They are the [[Electric field|electric ('''E''')]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic ('''H''')]] field strengths, and [[Electric flux|electric ('''D''')]] and [[magnetic flux|magnetic ('''B''')]] flux densities. These parameters are \u03b5, \u00b5, ''\u03ba'' and \u03c7 or permittivity, permeability, strength of chirality, and the Tellegen parameter, respectively. In this type of media, material parameters do not vary with changes along a rotated [[coordinate system]] of measurements. In this sense they are invariant or [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]].<ref name=metamaterialplasmonics1/>\n\nThe intrinsic magnetoelectric parameters, ''\u03ba'' and ''\u03c7'', affect the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the wave. The effect of the chirality parameter is to split the refractive index. In isotropic media this results in wave propagation only if \u03b5 and \u00b5 have the same sign. In bi-isotropic media with ''\u03c7'' assumed to be zero, and ''\u03ba'' a non-zero value, different results appear. Either a backward wave or a forward wave can occur. Alternatively, two forward waves or two backward waves can occur, depending on the strength of the chirality parameter.\n\nIn the general case, the constitutive relations for bi-anisotropic materials read \n<math>    \\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E} + \\xi \\mathbf{H},    </math>\n<math>    \\mathbf{B} = \\zeta \\mathbf{E} + \\mu  \\mathbf{H},    </math>\nwhere <math>    \\epsilon   </math> and <math>    \\mu   </math> are the permittivity and the permeability tensors, respectively, whereas <math> \\xi </math>  and  <math> \\zeta </math> are the two magneto-electric tensors.  If the medium is reciprocal,  permittivity and permeability are symmetric tensors, and <math>    \\xi=-\\zeta^T=-i \\kappa^T   </math>, where <math> \\kappa </math>  is the chiral tensor describing chiral electromagnetic and reciprocal magneto-electric response.  The chiral tensor can be expressed as <math>    \\kappa=\\tfrac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\kappa) I+N+J     </math>, where <math>    \\operatorname{tr}(\\kappa) </math> is the trace of <math>    \\kappa   </math>, I is the identity matrix, N is a symmetric trace-free tensor, and J is an antisymmetric tensor. Such decomposition allows us to classify the reciprocal bianisotropic response and we can identify the following three main classes: (i)  chiral media  (<math>  \\operatorname{tr}(\\kappa)  \\neq 0, N \\neq 0, J=0  </math>), (ii)  pseudochiral media (<math>  \\operatorname{tr}(\\kappa)  = 0, N \\neq 0, J=0  </math>), (iii) omega media   (<math>  \\operatorname{tr}(\\kappa)  = 0, N = 0, J \\neq 0  </math>).\n\n===Chiral===\nHandedness of metamaterials is a potential source of confusion as the metamaterial literature includes two conflicting uses of the terms ''left-'' and ''right-handed''. The first refers to one of the two circularly polarized waves that are the propagating modes in chiral media. The second relates to the triplet of electric field, magnetic field and Poynting vector that arise in negative refractive index media, which in most cases are not chiral.\n\nGenerally a chiral and/or bianisotropic electromagnetic response is a consequence of 3D geometrical chirality: [[Chirality (electromagnetism)#Intrinsic 3d chirality|3D-chiral]] metamaterials are composed by embedding 3D-chiral structures in a host medium and they show [[chirality (electromagnetism)|chirality-related polarization effects]] such as [[optical activity]] and [[circular dichroism]]. The concept of [[planar chirality|2D chirality]] also exists and a planar object is said to be chiral if it cannot be superposed onto its mirror image unless it is lifted from the plane. 2D-chiral metamaterials that are anisotropic and lossy have been observed to exhibit directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection, absorption) of circularly polarized waves due to circular conversion dichrosim.<ref>\n{{Cite journal| last = Fedotov| first =V.

As with electromagnetic waves, sonic waves can exhibit negative refraction.<ref name=acousticmeta1107/>\n\nControl of sound waves is mostly accomplished through the [[bulk modulus]] ''\u03b2'', [[mass density]] ''\u03c1'' and chirality. The bulk modulus and density are analogs of permittivity and permeability in electromagnetic metamaterials. Related to this is the mechanics of [[sound wave]] propagation in a [[lattice model (physics)|lattice]] structure. Also materials have [[mass]] and intrinsic degrees of [[stiffness]]. Together, these form a [[resonant]] system and the mechanical (sonic) resonance may be excited by appropriate sonic frequencies (for example audible [[pulse]]s).\n\n=== Structural ===\nStructural metamaterials provide properties such as crushability and light weight. Using [[projection micro-stereolithography]], microlattices can be created using forms much like [[trusses]] and [[girders]]. Materials four orders of magnitude stiffer than conventional [[aerogel]], but with the same density have been created. Such materials can withstand a load of at least 160,000 times their own weight by over-constraining the materials.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.gizmag.com/llnl-ultralight-metamaterial/32589|title = New materials developed that are as light as aerogel, yet 10,000 times stronger|last = Szondy|first = David|date = June 22, 2014|work = Gizmag}}</ref><ref name=\"cemms\">{{cite web |title = Projection Microstereolithography|first = Nicholas|last = Fang|publisher = Department of Mechanical Science & Engineering, University of Illinois|url = http://nano-cemms.illinois.edu/media/uploads/content/111/files/microstereolithography.20101112082545.pdf}}</ref>\n\nA ceramic nanotruss metamaterial can be flattened and revert to its original state.<ref name=\"Nanotruss\">{{cite web|last1 = Fesenmaier|first1 = Kimm|title = Miniature Truss Work|url = https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/miniature-truss-work-42850|website = Caltech|date = 23 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Thermal ===\nTypically materials found in nature, when homogeneous, are thermally isotropic. That is to say, heat passes through them at roughly the same rate in all directions. However, thermal metamaterials are anisotropic usually due to their highly organized internal structure. Composite materials with highly aligned internal particles or structures, such as fibers, are examples of this, for example carbon nanotubes (CNT).\n\n=== Nonlinear ===\n{{Main|Nonlinear metamaterials}}\nMetamaterials may be fabricated that include some form of [[nonlinear]] media, whose properties change with the power of the incident wave. Nonlinear media are essential for [[nonlinear optics]]. Most optical materials have a relatively weak response, meaning that their properties change by only a small amount for large changes in the intensity of the [[electromagnetic field]]. The local electromagnetic fields of the inclusions in nonlinear metamaterials can be much larger than the average value of the field. Besides, remarkable nonlinear effects have been predicted and observed if the metamaterial effective dielectric permittivity is very small (epsilon-near-zero media).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Extreme nonlinear electrodynamics in metamaterials with very small linear dielectric permittivity|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.81.043839|journal=Phys.

are made of [[atoms]], which are [[dipole]]s. These dipoles modify light velocity by a factor ''n'' (the refractive index). In a split ring resonator the ring and wire units act as atomic dipoles: the wire acts as a [[ferroelectric]] atom, while the ring acts as an [[inductor]] ''L, ''while the open section acts as a [[capacitor]] ''C''. The ring as a whole acts as an [[LC circuit]]. When the electromagnetic field passes through the ring, an induced current is created. The generated field is perpendicular to the light's magnetic field. The magnetic resonance results in a negative permeability; the refraction index is negative as well. (The lens is not truly flat, since the structure's capacitance imposes a slope for the electric induction.)\n\nSeveral (mathematical) material models [[frequency response]] in DNGs. One of these is the [[Lorentz model]], which describes electron motion in terms of a driven-damped, [[harmonic oscillator]]. The [[Debye relaxation]] model applies when the [[acceleration]] component of the Lorentz mathematical model is small compared to the other components of the equation. The [[Drude model]] applies when the [[restoring force]] component is negligible and the coupling coefficient is generally the [[plasma frequency]]. Other component distinctions call for the use of one of these models, depending on its polarity or purpose.<ref name=physicsengineering1/>\n\nThree-dimensional composites of metal/non-metallic inclusions periodically/randomly embedded in a low permittivity matrix are usually modeled by analytical methods, including mixing formulas and scattering-matrix based methods. The particle is modeled by either an electric dipole parallel to the electric field or a pair of crossed electric and magnetic dipoles parallel to the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, of the applied wave. These dipoles are the leading terms in the multipole series. They are the only existing ones for a homogeneous sphere, whose [[polarizability]] can be easily obtained from the [[Mie scattering]] coefficients. In general, this procedure is known as the \"point-dipole approximation\", which is a good approximation for metamaterials consisting of composites of electrically small spheres. Merits of these methods include low calculation cost and mathematical simplicity.<ref name=Shore2007>\n{{cite journal\n | doi = 10.1029/2007RS003647\n | title = Traveling waves on two- and three-dimensional periodic arrays of lossless scatterers\n | year = 2007\n | last1 = Shore\n | first1 = R.
