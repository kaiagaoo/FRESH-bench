This data set was curated to remove Web sites that often disclose personal data of people. It also upsamples sources considered trustworthy.<ref name=\"l2arxiv\"/> Llama 2 - Chat was additionally fine-tuned on 27,540 prompt-response pairs created for this project, which performed better than larger but lower-quality third-party datasets. For AI alignment, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) was used with a combination of 1,418,091 Meta examples and seven smaller datasets. The average dialog depth was 3.9 in the Meta examples, 3.0 for Anthropic Helpful and Anthropic Harmless sets, and 1.0 for five other sets, including OpenAI Summarize, StackExchange, etc.\n\n'''Llama 3''' consists of mainly English data, with over 5% in over 30 other languages. Its dataset was filtered by a text-quality classifier, and the classifier was trained by text synthesized by Llama 2.<ref name=\"llama3blog\" />\n\n=== Fine-tuning ===\nLlama 1 models are only available as foundational models with self-supervised learning and without fine-tuning. Llama 2 \u2013 Chat models were derived from foundational Llama 2 models. Unlike [[GPT-4]] which increased context length during fine-tuning, Llama 2 and Code Llama - Chat have the same context length of 4K tokens. Supervised fine-tuning used an autoregressive loss function with token loss on user prompts zeroed out. The batch size was 64.\n\nFor [[AI alignment]], human annotators wrote prompts and then compared two model outputs (a binary protocol), giving confidence levels and separate safety labels with veto power. Two separate reward models were trained from these preferences for safety and helpfulness using [[Reinforcement learning from human feedback]] (RLHF). A major technical contribution is the departure from the exclusive use of [[Proximal Policy Optimization]] (PPO) for RLHF \u2013 a new technique based on [[Rejection sampling]] was used, followed by PPO.\n\nMulti-turn consistency in dialogs was targeted for improvement, to make sure that \"system messages\" (initial instructions, such as \"speak in French\" and \"act like Napoleon\") are respected during the dialog. This was accomplished using the new \"Ghost attention\" technique during training, which concatenates relevant instructions to each new user message but zeros out the loss function for tokens in the prompt (earlier parts of the dialog).\n\n==Applications==\nThe [[Stanford University]] Institute for [[Human-centered computing|Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence]] (HAI) Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) released Alpaca, a training recipe based on the LLaMA 7B model that uses the \"Self-Instruct\" method of [[instruction tuning]] to acquire capabilities comparable to the OpenAI GPT-3 series text-davinci-003 model at a modest cost.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html |title=Alpaca: A Strong, Replicable Instruction-Following Model |date=13 March 2023 |first1=Rohan |last1=Taori |first2=Ishaan |last2=Gulrajani |first3=Tianyi |last3=Zhang |first4=Yann |last4=Dubois |first5=Xuechen |last5=Li |first6=Carlos |last6=Guestrin |first7=Percy |last7=Liang |first8=Tatsunori B. |last8=Hashimoto |website= |publisher=Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Models |access-date= |archive-date=6 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406082332/https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv | eprint=2212.10560 | last1=Wang | first1=Yizhong | last2=Kordi | first2=Yeganeh | last3=Mishra | first3=Swaroop | last4=Liu | first4=Alisa | last5=Smith | first5=Noah A. | last6=Khashabi | first6=Daniel | last7=Hajishirzi | first7=Hannaneh | title=Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions | year=2022 | class=cs.CL }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Stanford CRFM |url=https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html |website=crfm.stanford.edu |access-date=2023-03-20 |archive-date=2023-04-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406082332/https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The model files were officially removed on March 21, 2023, over hosting costs and safety concerns, though the code and paper remain online for reference.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Quach |first1=Katyanna |title=Stanford takes costly, risky Alpaca AI model offline |url=https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/21/stanford_ai_alpaca_taken_offline/ |website=www.theregister.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Stanford Researchers Take Down Alpaca AI Over Cost and Hallucinations |url=https://gizmodo.com/stanford-ai-alpaca-llama-facebook-taken-down-chatgpt-1850247570 |website=Gizmodo |language=en |date=21 March 2023 |access-date=20 October 2024 |archive-date=12 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240512075506/https://gizmodo.com/stanford-ai-alpaca-llama-facebook-taken-down-chatgpt-1850247570 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"repo-alpaca\" />\n\nMeditron is a family of Llama-based finetuned on a corpus of clinical guidelines, [[PubMed]] papers, and articles.
