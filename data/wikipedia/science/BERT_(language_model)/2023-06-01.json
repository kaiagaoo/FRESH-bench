Specifically, BERT is composed of Transformer encoder layers.\n\nBERT uses WordPiece to convert each English word into an integer code. Its vocabulary has size 30,000. Any token not appearing in its vocabulary is replaced by [UNK] for \"unknown\".\n\nBERT was pre-trained simultaneously on two tasks:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Summary of the models \u2014 transformers 3.4.0 documentation |url=https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.4.0/model_summary.html |access-date=2023-02-16 |website=huggingface.co}}</ref> \n\n''language modeling'': 15% of tokens were selected for prediction, and the training objective was to predict the selected token given its context. The selected token is \n\n* replaced with a [MASK] token with probability 80%,\n* replaced with a random word token with probability 10%,\n* not replaced with probability 10%.\n\nFor example, the sentence \"my dog is cute\" may have the 4-th token selected for prediction. The model would have input text\n\n* \"my dog is [MASK]\" with probability 80%,\n* \"my dog is happy\" with probability 10%,\n* \"my dog is cute\" with probability 10%.\n\nAfter processing the input text, the model's 4-th output vector is passed to a separate neural network, which outputs a probability distribution over its 30,000-large vocabulary.\n\n''next sentence prediction'': Given two spans of text, the model predicts if these two spans appeared sequentially in the training corpus, outputting either [IsNext] or [NotNext]. The first span starts with a special token [CLS] (for \"classify\"). The two spans are separated by a special token [SEP] (for \"separate\"). After processing the two spans, the 1-st output vector (the vector coding for [CLS]) is passed to a separate neural network for the binary classification into [IsNext] and [NotNext].\n\n* For example, given \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] he likes playing\" the model should output token [IsNext].\n* Given \"[CLS] my dog is cute [SEP] how do magnets work\" the model should output token [NotNext].\n\nAs a result of this training process, BERT learns [[Latent space|latent representations]] of words and sentences in context. After pre-training, BERT can be [[fine-tuning (machine learning)|fine-tuned]] with fewer resources on smaller datasets to optimize its performance on specific tasks such as NLP tasks (language inference, text classification) and sequence-to-sequence based language generation tasks (question-answering, conversational response generation).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Horev |first1=Rani |title=BERT Explained: State of the art language model for NLP |url=https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270 |website=Towards Data Science |access-date=27 September 2021 |date=2018}}</ref> The pre-training stage is significantly more [[Computational complexity|computationally expensive]] than fine-tuning.\n\n== Performance ==\nWhen BERT was published, it achieved [[State of the art|state-of-the-art]] performance on a number of [[Natural-language understanding|natural language understanding]] tasks:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* GLUE ([[General Language Understanding Evaluation]]) task set (consisting of 9 tasks)\n* SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset<ref>{{Cite arXiv |last1=Rajpurkar |first1=Pranav |last2=Zhang |first2=Jian |last3=Lopyrev |first3=Konstantin |last4=Liang |first4=Percy |date=2016-10-10 |title=SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text |class=cs.CL |eprint=1606.05250}}</ref>) v1.1 and v2.0\n* SWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations<ref>{{Cite arXiv |last1=Zellers |first1=Rowan |last2=Bisk |first2=Yonatan |last3=Schwartz |first3=Roy |last4=Choi |first4=Yejin |date=2018-08-15 |title=SWAG: A Large-Scale Adversarial Dataset for Grounded Commonsense Inference |class=cs.CL |eprint=1808.05326}}</ref>)\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe reasons for BERT's [[State of the art|state-of-the-art]] performance on these [[Natural-language understanding|natural language understanding]] tasks are not yet well understood.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last1=Kovaleva|first1=Olga|last2=Romanov|first2=Alexey|last3=Rogers|first3=Anna|last4=Rumshisky|first4=Anna|date=November 2019|chapter=Revealing the Dark Secrets of BERT|chapter-url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1445|language=en-us|pages=4364\u20134373|doi=10.18653/v1/D19-1445|title=Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP)|s2cid=201645145}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Kevin|last2=Khandelwal|first2=Urvashi|last3=Levy|first3=Omer|last4=Manning|first4=Christopher D.|date=2019|title=What Does BERT Look at?

This means that BERT, based on the Transformer model architecture, applies its self-attention mechanism to learn information from a text from the left and right side during training, and consequently gains a deep understanding of the context. For example, the word ''fine'' can have two different meanings depending on the context ('''I feel''' fine '''today''', '''She has''' fine '''blond hair''').  BERT considers the words surrounding the target word ''fine'' from the left and right side.\n\nHowever it comes at a cost: due to encoder-only architecture lacking a decoder, BERT can't [[Prompt engineering|be prompted]] and can't [[Natural language generation|generate text]], while bidirectional models in general do not work effectively without the right side,{{Clarify|date=March 2023}} thus being difficult to prompt, with even short text generation requiring sophisticated computationally expensive techniques.<ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=2209.14500 |last1=Patel |first1=Ajay |last2=Li |first2=Bryan |author3=Mohammad Sadegh Rasooli |last4=Constant |first4=Noah |last5=Raffel |first5=Colin |last6=Callison-Burch |first6=Chris |title=Bidirectional Language Models Are Also Few-shot Learners |year=2022 |class=cs.LG }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to deep learning neural networks which require very large amounts of data, BERT has already been pre-trained which means that it has learnt the representations of the words and sentences as well as the underlying semantic relations that they are connected with. BERT can then be [[fine-tuning (machine learning)|fine-tuned]] on smaller datasets for specific tasks such as sentiment classification. The pre-trained models are chosen according to the content of the given dataset one uses but also the goal of the task. For example, if the task is a sentiment classification task on financial data, a pre-trained model for the analysis of sentiment of financial text should be chosen. The weights of the original pre-trained models were released on [[GitHub]].<ref>{{cite web |title=BERT |url=https://github.com/google-research/bert |website=GitHub |access-date=28 March 2023}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nBERT was originally published by Google researchers Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. The design has its origins from pre-training contextual representations, including [[Semi-supervised learning|semi-supervised sequence learning]],<ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Dai |first1=Andrew |last2=Le | first2=Quoc |title=Semi-supervised Sequence Learning |date=4 November 2015 |eprint=1511.01432|class=cs.LG }}</ref> generative pre-training, [[ELMo]],<ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Peters |first1=Matthew |last2=Neumann | first2=Mark |last3=Iyyer | first3=Mohit |last4=Gardner | first4=Matt | last5=Clark | first5=Christopher | last6=Lee | first6=Kenton | last7=Luke | first7= Zettlemoyer |title=Deep contextualized word representations |date=15 February 2018 |eprint=1802.05365v2|class=cs.CL }}</ref> and ULMFit.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Howard |first1=Jeremy |last2=Ruder | first2=Sebastian |title=Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification |date=18 January 2018 |eprint=1801.06146v5|class=cs.CL }}</ref> Unlike previous models, BERT is a deeply bidirectional, [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] language representation, pre-trained using only a plain [[text corpus]]. Context-free models such as [[word2vec]] or [[GloVe (machine learning)|GloVe]] generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary, where BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word. For instance, whereas the vector for \"running\" will have the same word2vec vector representation for both of its occurrences in the sentences \"He is running a company\" and \"He is running a marathon\", BERT will provide a contextualized embedding that will be different according to the sentence.\n\nOn October 25, 2019, [[Google]] announced that they had started applying BERT models for [[English language]] [[Google Search|search queries]] within the [[US]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nayak |first1=Pandu |title=Understanding searches better than ever before |url=https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/ |website=Google Blog |date=25 October 2019 |access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref> On December 9, 2019, it was reported that BERT had been adopted by Google Search for over 70 languages.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Montti |first1=Roger |title=Google's BERT Rolls Out Worldwide |url=https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-bert-rolls-out-worldwide/339359/ |website=Search Engine Journal |date=10 December 2019 |publisher=Search Engine Journal |access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref> In October 2020, almost every single English-based query was processed by a BERT model.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-15|title=Google: BERT now used on almost every English query|url=https://searchengineland.com/google-bert-used-on-almost-every-english-query-342193|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Search Engine Land}}</ref>\n\n== Recognition ==\nThe research paper describing BERT won the Best Long Paper Award at the 2019 Annual [[Conference]] of the [[North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics]] (NAACL).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://naacl2019.org/blog/best-papers/|title=Best Paper Awards|date=2019|website=NAACL|access-date=Mar 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite arXiv |title=A Primer in BERTology: What we know about how BERT works |first1=Anna |last1=Rogers |first2=Olga |last2=Kovaleva |first3=Anna |last3=Rumshisky |year=2020 |class=cs.CL |eprint=2002.12327 }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://github.com/google-research/bert Official GitHub repository]\n* [https://devopedia.org/bert-language-model BERT on Devopedia]\n\n{{Google LLC}}\n{{Natural Language Processing}}\n{{Differentiable computing}}\n\n[[Category:Large language models]]"}
