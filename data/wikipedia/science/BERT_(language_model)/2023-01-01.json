As a result of the training process, BERT learns contextual embeddings for words.

Context-free models such as [[word2vec]] or [[GloVe (machine learning)|GloVe]] generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary, where BERT takes into account the context for each occurrence of a given word. For instance, whereas the vector for \"running\" will have the same word2vec vector representation for both of its occurrences in the sentences \"He is running a company\" and \"He is running a marathon\", BERT will provide a contextualized embedding that will be different according to the sentence.\n\nOn October 25, 2019, [[Google Search]] announced that they had started applying BERT models for [[English language]] search queries within the [[US]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nayak |first1=Pandu |title=Understanding searches better than ever before |url=https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/ |website=Google Blog |date=25 October 2019 |access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref> On December 9, 2019, it was reported that BERT had been adopted by Google Search for over 70 languages.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Montti |first1=Roger |title=Google's BERT Rolls Out Worldwide |url=https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-bert-rolls-out-worldwide/339359/ |website=Search Engine Journal |date=10 December 2019 |publisher=Search Engine Journal |access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref> In October 2020, almost every single English-based query was processed by BERT.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-15|title=Google: BERT now used on almost every English query|url=https://searchengineland.com/google-bert-used-on-almost-every-english-query-342193|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Search Engine Land}}</ref>\n\n== Recognition ==\nThe research paper describing BERT won the Best Long Paper Award at the 2019 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] (NAACL).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://naacl2019.org/blog/best-papers/|title=Best Paper Awards|date=2019|website=NAACL|access-date=Mar 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Transformer (machine learning model)]]\n* [[Word2vec]]\n* [[Autoencoder]]\n* [[Document-term matrix]]\n* [[Feature extraction]]\n* [[Feature learning]]\n* [[Language model#Neural network|Neural network language models]]\n* [[Vector space model]]\n* [[Thought vector]]\n* [[fastText]]\n* [[GloVe (machine learning)|GloVe]]\n* [[TensorFlow]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite arXiv |title=A Primer in BERTology: What we know about how BERT works |first1=Anna |last1=Rogers |first2=Olga |last2=Kovaleva |first3=Anna |last3=Rumshisky |year=2020 |class=cs.CL |eprint=2002.12327 }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://github.com/google-research/bert Official GitHub repository]\n* [https://devopedia.org/bert-language-model BERT on Devopedia]\n\n{{Natural Language Processing}}\n{{Differentiable computing}}\n\n[[Category:Natural language processing]]\n[[Category:Computational linguistics]]\n[[Category:Speech recognition]]\n[[Category:Computational fields of study]]"}
