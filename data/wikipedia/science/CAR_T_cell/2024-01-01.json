The receptors are [[Fusion protein|chimeric]] in that they combine both antigen-binding and T cell activating functions into a single receptor.\n\nCAR T [[cell therapy]] uses T cells engineered with CARs to treat cancer. T cells are modified to recognize cancer cells and destroy them. The standard approach is to harvest T cells from patients, genetically alter them, then infuse the resulting CAR T cells into patients to attack their tumors.<ref name=\"newsweek\">{{cite web |date=July 12, 2017 |work=NBC News |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-gene-therapy-cancer-offers-hope-those-no-options-left-n741326 |title=New Gene Therapy for Cancer Offers Hope to Those With No Options Left | vauthors = Fox M }}</ref>\n\nCAR T cells can be derived either [[autologous]]ly from T cells in a patient's own blood or [[Allotransplantation|allogeneically]] from those of a donor. Once isolated, these T cells are genetically engineered to express a specific CAR, using a vector derived from an engineered lentivirus such as HIV (see [[Lentiviral vector in gene therapy]]). The CAR programs the T cells to target an antigen present on the tumor cell surface.

This results in the CAR T-cells attacking non-tumor tissue, such as healthy B cells that express CD19 causing B-cell [[aplasia]]. The severity of this adverse effect can vary but the combination of prior immunosuppression, lymphodepleting chemotherapy and on-target effects causing hypogammaglobulinaemia and prolonged cytopenias places patients at increased risk of serious infections.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bupha-Intr O, Haeusler G, Chee L, Thursky K, Slavin M, Teh B | title = CAR-T cell therapy and infection: a review | journal = Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 749\u2013758 | date = June 2021 | pmid = 33249873 | doi = 10.1080/14787210.2021.1855143 | s2cid = 227235627 }}</ref>\n\nThere is also the unlikely possibility that the engineered CAR T-cells will themselves become transformed into cancerous cells through [[insertional mutagenesis]], due to the viral vector inserting the CAR gene into a [[tumor suppressor]] or [[oncogene]] in the host T cell's genome. Some retroviral (RV) vectors carry a lower risk than lentiviral (LV) vectors. However, both have the potential to be oncogenic.

To achieve this, the CAR T cell's engineered chimeric antigen receptor is split into two separate proteins that must come together in order to function. The first receptor protein typically contains the extracellular antigen binding domain, while the second protein contains the downstream signaling elements and co-stimulatory molecules (such as CD3\u03b6 and 4-1BB).  In the presence of an exogenous molecule (such as a rapamycin analog), the binding and signaling proteins dimerize together, allowing the CAR T cells to attack the tumor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu CY, Roybal KT, Puchner EM, Onuffer J, Lim WA | title = Remote control of therapeutic T cells through a small molecule-gated chimeric receptor | journal = Science | volume = 350 | issue = 6258 | pages = aab4077 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26405231 | pmc = 4721629 | doi = 10.1126/science.aab4077 | bibcode = 2015Sci...350.4077W }}</ref> Human EGFR truncated form (hEGFRt) has been used as an OFF-switch for CAR T cells using [[cetuximab]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n'''Bispecific molecules as switches''': Bispecific molecules target both a tumor-associated antigen and the CD3 molecule on the surface of T cells.
