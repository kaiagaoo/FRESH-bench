It is a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] vaccine, consisting of the ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' [[circumsporozoite protein]] (CSP) from the pre-erythrocytic stage. The CSP antigen causes the production of antibodies capable of preventing the invasion of [[hepatocytes]] and also elicits a cellular response enabling the destruction of infected hepatocytes. The CSP vaccine presented problems in the trial stage due to its poor [[immunogenicity]]. RTS,S attempted to avoid these by fusing the protein with a surface antigen from [[hepatitis B virus]], creating a more potent and immunogenic vaccine. When tested in trials as an emulsion of oil in water and with the added adjuvants of [[monophosphoryl A]] and QS21 (SBAS2), the vaccine gave protective immunity to 7 out of 8 volunteers when challenged with ''P. falciparum.''<ref name=\"Links to articles about recent RTS changes\">{{cite web|title=RTS,S malaria candidate vaccine reduces malaria by approximately one-third in African infants|url=http://www.malariavaccine.org/rd-rtss.php|work=malariavaccine.org|publisher=Malaria Vaccine Initiative Path|access-date=19 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002121/http://www.malariavaccine.org/rd-rtss.php|archive-date=23 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRTS,S was engineered using genes from the outer protein of ''P. falciparum'' malaria parasite and a portion of a hepatitis B virus plus a chemical [[adjuvant]] to boost the immune response.

The study ended in 2014. The effects of a booster dose were positive, even though overall efficacy seems to wane with time. After four years, reductions were 36 percent for children who received three shots and a booster dose. Missing the booster dose reduced the efficacy against severe malaria to a negligible effect. The vaccine was shown to be less effective for infants. Three doses of vaccine plus a booster reduced the risk of clinical episodes by 26 percent over three years but offered no significant protection against severe malaria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/malaria-vaccine-candidate-trial/37205|title=Malaria vaccine candidate shown to prevent thousands of cases|vauthors=Borghino D|date=27 April 2015|website=www.gizmag.com|access-date=11 June 2016|archive-date=6 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506193604/http://www.gizmag.com/malaria-vaccine-candidate-trial/37205/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn a bid to accommodate a larger group and guarantee a sustained availability for the general public, GSK applied for a marketing license with the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) in July 2014.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2014/gsk-announces-eu-regulatory-submission-for-malaria-vaccine-candidate-rtss//|title=GSK announces EU regulatory submission of malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S|publisher=GSK|date=24 July 2014|access-date=30 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005601/http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2014/gsk-announces-eu-regulatory-submission-for-malaria-vaccine-candidate-rtss/|archive-date=4 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> GSK treated the project as a non-profit initiative, with most funding coming from the Gates Foundation, a major contributor to malaria eradication.<ref>{{cite news|title=GSK aims to market world's first malaria vaccine|vauthors=Kelland K|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaria-vaccine-gsk-idUSBRE9960Y320131007|newspaper=Reuters|date=7 October 2013|access-date=9 December 2013|archive-date=18 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118150321/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaria-vaccine-gsk-idUSBRE9960Y320131007|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, Mosquirix received a positive scientific opinion from the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) on the proposal for the vaccine to be used to vaccinate children aged 6 weeks to 17 months outside the European Union.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/first-malaria-vaccine-receives-positive-scientific-opinion-ema|title=First malaria vaccine receives positive scientific opinion from EMA|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA)|date=24 July 2015|access-date=30 July 2015|archive-date=3 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003060644/https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/first-malaria-vaccine-receives-positive-scientific-opinion-ema|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"EMA Mosquirix\">{{cite web | title=Mosquirix: Opinion on medicine for use outside EU | website=[[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) | url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/opinion-medicine-use-outside-EU/human/mosquirix | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191123055901/https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/mosquirix-h-w-2300 | archive-date=23 November 2019 | url-status=live | access-date=22 November 2019}}</ref> A pilot project for vaccination was launched on 23 April 2019 in [[Malawi]], on 30 April 2019 in [[Ghana]], and on 13 September 2019 in [[Kenya]].<ref name=\"Wuxi\">{{cite press release |vauthors=Alonso P |date=19 June 2019 |title=Letter to partners \u2013 June 2019 |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/19-06-2019-letter-to-partners-june-2019 |location=Wuxi |publisher=World Health Organization |access-date=22 October 2019 |archive-date=31 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220131030007/https://www.who.int/news/item/19-06-2019-letter-to-partners-june-2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Homa\">{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s);

These came from a variety of stages during the lifecycle. CSP and sporozoite surface protein 2 (called [[PfSSP2]]) were derived from the sporozoite phase. The liver stage antigen 1 (LSA1), three from the erythrocytic stage (merozoite surface protein 1, serine repeat antigen, and AMA-1), and one sexual stage antigen (the 25-kDa Pfs25) were included. This was first investigated using [[rhesus monkeys]] and produced encouraging results: 4 out of the 7 antigens produced specific antibody responses (CSP, PfSSP2, [[Merozoite surface protein|MSP1]] and PFs25). Later trials in humans, despite demonstrating cellular immune responses in over 90% of the subjects, had very poor antibody responses.

The [[Plasmodium|''Plasmodium'' species]] has a very high rate of replication, much higher than that actually needed to ensure transmission in the parasite's lifecycle.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}<!-- this info doesn't seem to be in the source cited for this section --> This enables pharmaceutical treatments that are effective at reducing the reproduction rate, but not halting it, to exert a high selection pressure, thus favoring the development of resistance. The process of evolutionary change is one of the key considerations necessary when considering potential vaccine candidates. The development of resistance could cause a significant reduction in efficacy of any potential vaccine thus rendering useless a carefully developed and effective treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kennedy DA, Read AF | title = Why the evolution of vaccine resistance is less of a concern than the evolution of drug resistance | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 51 | pages = 12878\u201312886 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30559199 | pmc = 6304978 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1717159115 | bibcode = 2018PNAS..11512878K | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Choosing to address the symptom or the source===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2023}}\nThe parasite induces two main response types from the human immune system.  These are anti-parasitic immunity and anti-toxic immunity.\n* \"Anti-parasitic immunity\" addresses the source; it consists of an antibody response ([[humoral immunity]]) and a cell-mediated immune response. Ideally, a vaccine would enable the development of anti-plasmodial [[antibodies]] in addition to generating an elevated cell-mediated response.  Potential antigens against which a vaccine could be targeted will be discussed in greater depth later. Antibodies are part of the specific immune response. They exert their effect by activating the complement cascade, stimulating [[phagocytic cells]] into [[endocytosis]] through adhesion to an external surface of the antigenic substances, thus 'marking' it as offensive.  Humoral or cell-mediated immunity consists of many interlinking mechanisms that essentially aim to prevent infection entering the body (through external barriers or hostile internal environments) and then kill any micro-organisms or foreign particles that succeed in penetration. The cell-mediated component consists of many white blood cells (such as [[monocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[macrophages]], [[lymphocytes]], [[basophils]], [[mast cells]], [[natural killer cells]], and [[eosinophils]]) that target foreign bodies by a variety of different mechanisms. In the case of malaria, both systems would be targeted to attempt to increase the potential response generated, thus ensuring the maximum chance of preventing disease. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n* \"Anti-toxic immunity\" addresses the symptoms; it refers to the suppression of the immune response associated with the production of factors that either induce symptoms or reduce the effect that any toxic by-products (of micro-organism presence) have on the development of disease. For example, it has been shown that [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] has a central role in generating the symptoms experienced in severe ''P. falciparum'' malaria. Thus a therapeutic vaccine could target the production of TNF-a, preventing respiratory distress and cerebral symptoms. This approach has serious limitations as it would not reduce the parasitic load; rather, it only reduces the associated pathology.  As a result, there are substantial difficulties in evaluating efficacy in human trials.\n\nTaking this information into consideration an ideal vaccine candidate would attempt to generate a more substantial cell-mediated and antibody response on parasite presentation. This would have the benefit of increasing the rate of parasite clearance, thus reducing the experienced symptoms and providing a level  of consistent future immunity against the parasite.\n\n===Potential targets===\n{{see also|PfSPZ Vaccine}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Potential vaccine targets in the [[Plasmodium#Life cycle|malaria lifecycle]] (Doolan and Hoffman)\n|-\n!

Anti-host [[erythrocyte]], antibodies blocking fertilisation, antibodies blocking egress from the mosquito midgut.\n|}\n\nBy their very nature, protozoa are more complex organisms than bacteria and viruses, with more complicated structures and lifecycles. This presents problems in vaccine development but also increases the number of potential targets for a vaccine. These have been summarised into the lifecycle stage and the antibodies that could potentially elicit an immune response.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}\n\nThe epidemiology of malaria varies enormously across the globe and has led to the belief that it may be necessary to adopt very different vaccine development strategies to target the different populations. A Type 1 vaccine is suggested for those exposed mostly to ''P. falciparum'' malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, with the primary objective to reduce the number of severe malaria cases and deaths in infants and children exposed to high transmission rates. The Type 2 vaccine could be thought of as a 'travelers' vaccine,' aiming to prevent all clinical symptoms in individuals with no previous exposure. This is another major public health problem, with malaria presenting as one of the most substantial threats to travelers' health. Problems with the available pharmaceutical therapies include costs, availability, adverse effects and contraindications, inconvenience, and compliance, many of which would be reduced or eliminated if an effective (greater than 85\u201390%) vaccine was developed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe lifecycle of the malaria parasite is particularly complex, presenting initial developmental problems. Despite the huge number of vaccines available, there are none that target parasitic infections. The distinct developmental stages involved in the lifecycle present numerous opportunities for targeting antigens, thus potentially eliciting an immune response.  Theoretically, each developmental stage could have a vaccine developed specifically to target the parasite. Moreover, any vaccine produced would ideally have the ability to be of therapeutic value as well as preventing further transmission and is likely to consist of a combination of antigens from different phases of the parasite's development.  More than 30 of these antigens are being researched{{when|date=October 2021}} by teams all over the world in the hope of identifying a combination that can elicit immunity in the inoculated individual. Some of the approaches involve surface expression of the antigen, inhibitory effects of specific antibodies on the lifecycle and the protective effects through immunization or passive transfer of antibodies between an immune and a non-immune host. The majority of research into malarial vaccines has focused on the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' strain due to the high mortality caused by the parasite and the ease of carrying out in vitro/in vivo studies. The earliest vaccines attempted to use the parasitic [[circumsporozoite protein]] (CSP). This is the most dominant surface antigen of the initial pre-erythrocytic phase. However, problems were encountered due to low efficacy, [[reactogenicity]] and low [[immunogenicity]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n* The initial stage in the lifecycle, following inoculation, is a relatively short \"pre-erythrocytic\" or \"hepatic\" phase. A vaccine at this stage must have the ability to protect against sporozoites invading and possibly inhibiting the development of parasites in the hepatocytes (through inducing [[cytotoxic]] [[T-lymphocytes]] that can destroy the infected [[liver cells]]). However, if any sporozoites evaded the immune system they would then have the potential to be symptomatic and cause the clinical disease.\n* The second phase of the lifecycle is the \"erythrocytic\" or blood phase. A vaccine here could prevent [[merozoite]] multiplication or the invasion of [[red blood cells]]. This approach is complicated by the lack of [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC molecule]] expression on the surface of erythrocytes. Instead, malarial antigens are expressed, and it is this towards which the antibodies could potentially be directed. Another approach would be to attempt to block the process of erythrocyte adherence to blood vessel walls. It is thought that this process is accountable for much of the clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection; therefore, a vaccine given during this stage would be therapeutic and hence administered during clinical episodes to prevent further deterioration.\n* The last phase of the lifecycle that has the potential to be targeted by a vaccine is the \"sexual stage\". This would not give any protective benefits to the individual inoculated but would prevent further transmission of the parasite by preventing the [[gametocytes]] from producing multiple sporozoites in the gut wall of the mosquito. It therefore would be used as part of a policy directed at eliminating the parasite from areas of low prevalence or to prevent the development and spread of vaccine-resistant parasites. This type of transmission-blocking vaccine is potentially very important. The evolution of resistance in the malaria parasite occurs very quickly, potentially making any vaccine redundant within a few generations.

It is able to stay dormant in the [[liver]] and reemerge years later to elicit new infections.  Two key proteins involved in the invasion of the red blood cells (RBC) by ''P. vivax'' are potential targets for drug or vaccine development.  When the Duffy binding protein (DBP) of ''P. vivax'' binds the Duffy antigen (DARC) on the surface of RBC, process for the parasite to enter the RBC is initiated.  Structures of the core region of DARC and the receptor binding pocket of DBP have been mapped by scientists at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]].  The researchers found that the binding is a two-step process that involves two copies of the parasite protein acting together like a pair of tongs that \"clamp\" two copies of DARC.    Antibodies that interfere with the binding by either targeting the key region of the DARC or the DBP will prevent the infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/protein-discovery-could-aid-malaria-vaccine-design/2014-01-13|title=Scientists capture key protein structures that could aid malaria vaccine design|vauthors=Mullin E|publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=13 January 2014|access-date=16 January 2014|archive-date=18 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118112924/http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/protein-discovery-could-aid-malaria-vaccine-design/2014-01-13|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Batchelor JD, Malpede BM, Omattage NS, DeKoster GT, Henzler-Wildman KA, Tolia NH | title = Red blood cell invasion by Plasmodium vivax: structural basis for DBP engagement of DARC | journal = PLOS Pathogens | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = e1003869 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24415938 | pmc = 3887093 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003869 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n* Antibodies against the [[Schizont]] Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1) were found to disable the parasite's ability to rupture from the infected red blood cells (RBCs), thus preventing it from continuing with its lifecycle.  Researchers from [[Rhode Island Hospital]] identified ''Plasmodium falciparum'' PfSEA-1, a 244 kd malaria antigen expressed in the schizont-infected RBCs.  Mice vaccinated with the recombinant PfSEA-1 produced antibodies which interrupted the schizont rupture from the RBCs and decreased the parasite replication.  The vaccine protected the mice from the lethal challenge of the parasite.  Tanzanian and Kenyan children who have antibodies to PfSEA-1 were found to have fewer parasites in their bloodstream and a milder case of malaria.  By blocking the schizont outlet, the PfSEA-1 vaccine may work synergistically with vaccines targeting the other stages of the malaria lifecycle such as [[hepatocyte]] and RBC invasion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/antigen-discovery-could-advance-malaria-vaccine/2014-05-27|title=Antigen Discovery could advance malaria vaccine|vauthors=Mullin E|publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=27 May 2014|access-date=22 June 2014|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054914/http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/antigen-discovery-could-advance-malaria-vaccine/2014-05-27|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Raj DK, Nixon CP, Nixon CE, Dvorin JD, DiPetrillo CG, Pond-Tor S, Wu HW, Jolly G, Pischel L, Lu A, Michelow IC, Cheng L, Conteh S, McDonald EA, Absalon S, Holte SE, Friedman JF, Fried M, Duffy PE, Kurtis JD | display-authors = 6 | title = Antibodies to PfSEA-1 block parasite egress from RBCs and protect against malaria infection | journal = Science | volume = 344 | issue = 6186 | pages = 871\u20137 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24855263 | pmc = 4184151 | doi = 10.1126/science.1254417 | bibcode = 2014Sci...344..871R }}</ref>\n\n===Mix of antigenic components===\n\nIncreasing the potential immunity generated against ''Plasmodia'' can be achieved by attempting to target multiple phases in the lifecycle.
