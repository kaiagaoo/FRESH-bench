The only approved use of a vaccine outside the [[European Union|EU]], as of 2022, is [[RTS,S]], known by the brand name ''Mosquirix''.<ref name=\"EMA Mosquirix\" /> In October 2021, the WHO for the first time recommended the large-scale use of a malaria vaccine for children living in areas with moderate-to-high malaria transmission. Four injections are required for full protection.<ref name=\"EMA Mosquirix\" />\n\nResearch continues with other malaria vaccines.

It consists of the ''P. falciparum'' [[circumsporozoite protein]] (CSP) from the pre-erythrocytic stage. The CSP antigen causes the production of antibodies capable of preventing the invasion of [[hepatocytes]] and additionally elicits a cellular response enabling the destruction of infected hepatocytes. The CSP vaccine presented problems in the trial stage due to its poor [[immunogenicity]]. RTS,S attempted to avoid these by fusing the protein with a surface antigen from [[hepatitis B]], creating a more potent and immunogenic vaccine. When tested in trials an emulsion of oil in water and the added adjuvants of [[monophosphoryl A]] and QS21 (SBAS2), the vaccine gave protective immunity to 7 out of 8 volunteers when challenged with ''P. falciparum.''<ref name=\"Links to articles about recent RTS changes\">{{cite web|title=RTS,S malaria candidate vaccine reduces malaria by approximately one-third in African infants|url=http://www.malariavaccine.org/rd-rtss.php|work=malariavaccine.org|publisher=Malaria Vaccine Initiative Path|access-date=19 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002121/http://www.malariavaccine.org/rd-rtss.php|archive-date=23 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRTS,S/AS01 (commercial name ''Mosquirix''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lse.co.uk/FinanceNews.asp?ArticleCode=zomftb67bm5garg&ArticleHeadline=GSK_malaria_vaccine_shows_longlasting_protection |title=Commercial name of RTS,S |access-date=20 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405215203/http://www.lse.co.uk/FinanceNews.asp?ArticleCode=zomftb67bm5garg&ArticleHeadline=GSK_malaria_vaccine_shows_longlasting_protection |archive-date=5 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> was engineered using genes from the outer protein of ''P. falciparum'' malaria parasite and a portion of a hepatitis B virus plus a chemical [[adjuvant]] to boost the immune response.

These came from a variety of stages during the life cycle. CSP and sporozoite surface protein 2 (called [[PfSSP2]]) were derived from the sporozoite phase. The liver stage antigen 1 (LSA1), three from the erythrocytic stage (merozoite surface protein 1, serine repeat antigen, and AMA-1), and one sexual stage antigen (the 25-kDa Pfs25) were included. This was first investigated using [[rhesus monkeys]] and produced encouraging results: 4 out of the 7 antigens produced specific antibody responses (CSP, PfSSP2, [[Merozoite surface protein|MSP1]] and PFs25). Later trials in humans, despite demonstrating cellular immune responses in over 90% of the subjects, had very poor antibody responses. Despite this following administration of the vaccine, some candidates had complete protection when challenged with ''P. falciparum''.

There are a number of considerations to be made concerning what strategy a potential vaccine should adopt.\n\n===Parasite diversity===\n\n''P. falciparum'' has demonstrated the capability, through the development of multiple drug-resistant parasites, for evolutionary change. The [[Plasmodium|''Plasmodium'' species]] has a very high rate of replication, much higher than that actually needed to ensure transmission in the parasite's life cycle. This enables pharmaceutical treatments that are effective at reducing the reproduction rate, but not halting it, to exert a high selection pressure, thus favoring the development of resistance. The process of evolutionary change is one of the key considerations necessary when considering potential vaccine candidates. The development of resistance could cause a significant reduction in efficacy of any potential vaccine thus rendering useless a carefully developed and effective treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kennedy DA, Read AF | title = Why the evolution of vaccine resistance is less of a concern than the evolution of drug resistance | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 51 | pages = 12878\u201312886 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30559199 | pmc = 6304978 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1717159115 | bibcode = 2018PNAS..11512878K | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Choosing to address the symptom or the source===\n\nThe parasite induces two main response types from the human immune system.  These are anti-parasitic immunity and anti-toxic immunity.\n* \"Anti-parasitic immunity\" addresses the source; it consists of an antibody response ([[humoral immunity]]) and a cell-mediated immune response. Ideally, a vaccine would enable the development of anti-plasmodial [[antibodies]] in addition to generating an elevated cell-mediated response.  Potential antigens against which a vaccine could be targeted will be discussed in greater depth later. Antibodies are part of the specific immune response. They exert their effect by activating the complement cascade, stimulating [[phagocytic cells]] into [[endocytosis]] through adhesion to an external surface of the antigenic substances, thus 'marking' it as offensive.  Humoral or cell-mediated immunity consists of many interlinking mechanisms that essentially aim to prevent infection entering the body (through external barriers or hostile internal environments) and then kill any micro-organisms or foreign particles that succeed in penetration. The cell-mediated component consists of many white blood cells (such as [[monocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[macrophages]], [[lymphocytes]], [[basophils]], [[mast cells]], [[natural killer cells]], and [[eosinophils]]) that target foreign bodies by a variety of different mechanisms. In the case of malaria, both systems would be targeted to attempt to increase the potential response generated, thus ensuring the maximum chance of preventing disease. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n* \"Anti-toxic immunity\" addresses the symptoms; it refers to the suppression of the immune response associated with the production of factors that either induce symptoms or reduce the effect that any toxic by-products (of micro-organism presence) have on the development of disease. For example, it has been shown that [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] has a central role in generating the symptoms experienced in severe ''P. falciparum'' malaria. Thus a therapeutic vaccine could target the production of TNF-a, preventing respiratory distress and cerebral symptoms. This approach has serious limitations as it would not reduce the parasitic load; rather, it only reduces the associated pathology.  As a result, there are substantial difficulties in evaluating efficacy in human trials.\n\nTaking this information into consideration an ideal vaccine candidate would attempt to generate a more substantial cell-mediated and antibody response on parasite presentation. This would have the benefit of increasing the rate of parasite clearance, thus reducing the experienced symptoms and providing a level  of consistent future immunity against the parasite.\n\n===Potential targets===\n{{see also|PfSPZ Vaccine}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Potential vaccine targets in the [[Plasmodium#Life cycle|malaria lifecycle]] (Doolan and Hoffman)\n|-\n!

This presents problems in vaccine development but also increases the number of potential targets for a vaccine. These have been summarised into the life cycle stage and the antibodies that could potentially elicit an immune response.\n\nThe epidemiology of malaria varies enormously across the globe and has led to the belief that it may be necessary to adopt very different vaccine development strategies to target the different populations. A Type 1 vaccine is suggested for those exposed mostly to ''P. falciparum'' malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, with the primary objective to reduce the number of severe malaria cases and deaths in infants and children exposed to high transmission rates. The Type 2 vaccine could be thought of as a 'travelers' vaccine,' aiming to prevent all clinical symptoms in individuals with no previous exposure. This is another major public health problem, with malaria presenting as one of the most substantial threats to travelers' health. Problems with the available pharmaceutical therapies include costs, availability, adverse effects and contraindications, inconvenience, and compliance, many of which would be reduced or eliminated if an effective (greater than 85\u201390%) vaccine was developed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe life cycle of the malaria parasite is particularly complex, presenting initial developmental problems. Despite the huge number of vaccines available, there are none that target parasitic infections. The distinct developmental stages involved in the life cycle present numerous opportunities for targeting antigens, thus potentially eliciting an immune response.  Theoretically, each developmental stage could have a vaccine developed specifically to target the parasite. Moreover, any vaccine produced would ideally have the ability to be of therapeutic value as well as preventing further transmission and is likely to consist of a combination of antigens from different phases of the parasite's development.  More than 30 of these antigens are being researched{{when|date=October 2021}} by teams all over the world in the hope of identifying a combination that can elicit immunity in the inoculated individual. Some of the approaches involve surface expression of the antigen, inhibitory effects of specific antibodies on the life cycle and the protective effects through immunization or passive transfer of antibodies between an immune and a non-immune host. The majority of research into malarial vaccines has focused on the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' strain due to the high mortality caused by the parasite and the ease of carrying out in vitro/in vivo studies. The earliest vaccines attempted to use the parasitic [[circumsporozoite protein]] (CSP). This is the most dominant surface antigen of the initial pre-erythrocytic phase. However, problems were encountered due to low efficacy, [[reactogenicity]] and low [[immunogenicity]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n* The initial stage in the life cycle, following inoculation, is a relatively short \"pre-erythrocytic\" or \"hepatic\" phase. A vaccine at this stage must have the ability to protect against sporozoites invading and possibly inhibiting the development of parasites in the hepatocytes (through inducing [[cytotoxic]] [[T-lymphocytes]] that can destroy the infected [[liver cells]]). However, if any sporozoites evaded the immune system they would then have the potential to be symptomatic and cause the clinical disease.\n* The second phase of the life cycle is the \"erythrocytic\" or blood phase. A vaccine here could prevent [[merozoite]] multiplication or the invasion of [[red blood cells]]. This approach is complicated by the lack of [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC molecule]] expression on the surface of erythrocytes. Instead, malarial antigens are expressed, and it is this towards which the antibodies could potentially be directed. Another approach would be to attempt to block the process of erythrocyte adherence to blood vessel walls. It is thought that this process is accountable for much of the clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection; therefore, a vaccine given during this stage would be therapeutic and hence administered during clinical episodes to prevent further deterioration.\n* The last phase of the life cycle that has the potential to be targeted by a vaccine is the \"sexual stage\". This would not give any protective benefits to the individual inoculated but would prevent further transmission of the parasite by preventing the [[gametocytes]] from producing multiple sporozoites in the gut wall of the mosquito. It therefore would be used as part of a policy directed at eliminating the parasite from areas of low prevalence or to prevent the development and spread of vaccine-resistant parasites. This type of transmission-blocking vaccine is potentially very important. The evolution of resistance in the malaria parasite occurs very quickly, potentially making any vaccine redundant within a few generations. This approach to the prevention of spread is therefore essential.\n* Another approach is to target the [[protein kinases]], which are present during the entire lifecycle of the malaria parasite. Research is underway on this, yet production of an actual vaccine targeting these protein kinases may still take a long time.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang VM, Chavchich M, Waters NC | title = Targeting protein kinases in the malaria parasite: update of an antimalarial drug target | journal = Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 456\u201372 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22242850 | doi = 10.2174/156802612799362922 | url = http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CTMC/2012/00000012/00000005/0006R.SGM | access-date = 23 March 2020 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130530081801/http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CTMC%2F2012%2F00000012%2F00000005%2F0006R.SGM | archive-date = 30 May 2013 }}</ref>\n* Report of a vaccine candidate capable of neutralizing all tested strains of ''Plasmodium falciparum'', the most deadly form of the parasite causing malaria, was published in ''[[Nature Communications]]'' by a team of scientists from the [[University of Oxford]] in 2011.<ref name=vaccine>{{cite journal | vauthors = Douglas AD, Williams AR, Illingworth JJ, Kamuyu G, Biswas S, Goodman AL, Wyllie DH, Crosnier C, Miura K, Wright GJ, Long CA, Osier FH, Marsh K, Turner AV, Hill AV, Draper SJ | display-authors = 6 | title = The blood-stage malaria antigen PfRH5 is susceptible to vaccine-inducible cross-strain neutralizing antibody | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 601 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22186897 | pmc = 3504505 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms1615 | bibcode = 2011NatCo...2..601D }}</ref>  The [[viral vector vaccine]], targeting a full-length ''P. falciparum'' reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 (PfRH5) was found to induce an antibody response in an animal model.

It is able to stay dormant in the [[liver]] and reemerge years later to elicit new infections.  Two key proteins involved in the invasion of the red blood cells (RBC) by ''P. vivax'' are potential targets for drug or vaccine development.  When the Duffy binding protein (DBP) of ''P. vivax'' binds the Duffy antigen (DARC) on the surface of RBC, process for the parasite to enter the RBC is initiated.  Structures of the core region of DARC and the receptor binding pocket of DBP have been mapped by scientists at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]].  The researchers found that the binding is a two-step process that involves two copies of the parasite protein acting together like a pair of tongs that \"clamp\" two copies of DARC.

A vaccine targeting several antigens may require delivery to different areas and by different means in order to elicit an effective response. Some [[adjuvants]] can direct the vaccine to the specifically targeted cell type\u2014e.g., the use of [[Hepatitis B virus]] in the [[RTS,S]] vaccine to target infected hepatocytes\u2014but in other cases, particularly when using combined antigenic vaccines, this approach is very complex. Some methods that have been attempted include the use of two vaccines, one directed at generating a blood response and the other a liver-stage response. These two vaccines could then be injected into two different sites, thus enabling the use of a more specific and potentially efficacious delivery system.\n\nTo increase, accelerate or modify the development of an immune response to a vaccine candidate, it is often necessary to combine the antigenic substance to be delivered with an adjuvant or specialised delivery system. These terms are often used interchangeably in relation to vaccine development; however in most cases a distinction can be made. An adjuvant is typically thought of as a substance used in combination with the antigen to produce a more substantial and robust immune response than that elicited by the antigen alone. This is achieved through three mechanisms: by affecting the antigen delivery and presentation, by inducing the production of immunomodulatory cytokines, and by affecting the [[antigen presenting cells]] (APC). Adjuvants can consist of many different materials, from cell microparticles to other particulate delivery systems (e.g. [[liposome]]s).\n\nAdjuvants are crucial in affecting the specificity and isotype of the necessary antibodies. They are thought to be able to potentiate the link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Due to the diverse nature of substances that can potentially have this effect on the immune system, it is difficult to classify adjuvants into specific groups. In most circumstances they consist of easily identifiable components of micro-organisms that are recognised by the innate immune system cells. The role of delivery systems is primarily to direct the chosen adjuvant and antigen into target cells to attempt to increase the efficacy of the vaccine further, therefore acting synergistically with the adjuvant.\n\nThere is increasing concern that the use of very potent adjuvants could precipitate autoimmune responses, making it imperative that the vaccine is focused on the target cells only. Specific delivery systems can reduce this risk by limiting the potential toxicity and systemic distribution of newly developed adjuvants.\n\nStudies into the efficacy of malaria vaccines developed to date{{when|date=November 2019}} have illustrated that the presence of an adjuvant is key in determining any protection gained against malaria. A large number of natural and synthetic adjuvants have been identified throughout the history of vaccine development. Options identified thus far for use combined with a malaria vaccine include mycobacterial cell walls, liposomes, monophosphoryl lipid A and squalene.\n\n== History ==\n{{expand section|date=February 2018|reason=Long history of failed attempts; current material is one-sided and mainly recent.}}\n\nIndividuals who are exposed to the parasite in endemic countries develop acquired immunity against disease and death. Such immunity does not, however prevent malarial infection; immune individuals often harbour asymptomatic parasites in their blood.  This does, however, imply that it is possible to create an immune response that protects against the harmful effects of the parasite.\n\nResearch shows that if [[immunoglobulin]] is taken from immune adults, purified, and then given to individuals who have no protective immunity, some protection can be gained.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://primaryimmune.org/treatment-information/immunoglobulin-therapy|title=Immunoglobulin Therapy & Other Medical Therapies for Antibody Deficiencies |website=Immune Deficiency Foundation|access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Irradiated mosquitoes ===<!-- What came of this?
