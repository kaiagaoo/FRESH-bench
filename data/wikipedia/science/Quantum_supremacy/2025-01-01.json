In this setting, a ''problem'' consists of an inputted [[Computational complexity theory|problem instance]] (a binary string) and returned solution (corresponding output string), while ''resources'' refers to designated elementary operations, memory usage, or communication. A collection of local operations allows for the computer to generate the output string. A circuit model and its corresponding operations are useful in describing both classical and quantum problems; the classical circuit model consists of basic operations such as [[AND gate]]s, [[OR gate]]s, and [[NOT gate]]s while the quantum model consists of classical circuits and the application of unitary operations. Unlike the finite set of classical gates, there are an infinite amount of quantum gates due to the continuous nature of unitary operations. In both classical and quantum cases, complexity swells with increasing problem size.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cleve|first=Richard|title=An Introduction to Quantum Complexity Theory|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/392006/files/9906111.pdf|journal=CERN|year=2000|bibcode=2000qcqi.book..103C}}</ref> As an extension of classical [[computational complexity theory]], [[quantum complexity theory]] considers what a theoretical [[Quantum Turing machine|universal quantum computer]] could accomplish without accounting for the difficulty of building a physical quantum computer or dealing with [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]] and noise.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediacomp00meye |url-access=limited |last=Watrous |first=John |date=2009 |publisher=Springer New York |isbn=9780387758886 |editor-last=Meyers |editor-first=Robert A. |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediacomp00meye/page/n3382 7174]\u20137201 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-30440-3_428|chapter = Quantum Computational Complexity|s2cid=1380135 }}</ref> Since [[quantum information]] is a generalization of classical information, [[Quantum computing|quantum computers]] can simulate any [[Algorithm|classical algorithm]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n[[Complexity class|Quantum complexity classes]] are sets of problems that share a common quantum computational model, with each model containing specified resource constraints.

Not only would answers to these questions reveal the nature of BQP, but they would also answer difficult classical complexity theory questions.
