These waves were first predicted by Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]] in 1916, when the technology necessary for their detection did not yet exist. Their existence was indirectly confirmed when observations of the binary pulsar [[PSR 1913+16]] in 1974 showed an orbital decay which matched Einstein's predictions of energy loss by gravitational radiation.

Their discovery has launched a new branch of astronomy to complement [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] telescopes and [[neutrino]] observatories. [[Joseph Weber]] pioneered the effort to detect gravitational waves in the 1960s through his work on [[Weber bar|resonant mass bar detectors]]. Bar detectors continue to be used at six sites worldwide. By the 1970s, scientists including [[Rainer Weiss]] realized the applicability of laser [[interferometry]] to gravitational wave measurements. [[Robert Forward]] operated an interferometric detector at Hughes in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"obituary\">{{cite web |title=Obituary: Dr. Robert L.

Later, in 1965, [[Vladimir Braginsky|Braginsky]] extensively discussed gravitational-wave sources and their possible detection. He pointed out the 1962 paper and mentioned the possibility of detecting gravitational waves if the interferometric technology and measuring techniques improved.\n\nSince the early 1990s, physicists have thought that technology has evolved to the point where detection of [[gravitational wave]]s\u2014of significant astrophysical interest\u2014is now possible.<ref>{{Cite journal| title= Astrophysical Sources of Gravitational Radiation |journal= [[Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science]]|volume= 44|issue= 44|pages= 655\u2013717|doi= 10.1146/annurev.ns.44.120194.003255| doi-access=free|year= 1994|last1= Bonazzola|first1= S|last2= Marck|first2= J A|bibcode= 1994ARNPS..44..655B}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2002, LIGO began its search for cosmic gravitational waves. Measurable emissions of gravitational waves are expected from binary systems (collisions and coalescences of [[neutron star]]s or [[black holes]]), [[supernova]] explosions of massive stars (which form neutron stars and black holes), accreting neutron stars, rotations of neutron stars with deformed crusts, and the remnants of gravitational radiation created by the [[Big Bang|birth of the universe]]. The observatory may, in theory, also observe more exotic hypothetical phenomena, such as gravitational waves caused by oscillating [[cosmic string]]s or colliding [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain walls]].\n\n==Observatories==<!-- This section is linked from [[LIGO Livingston Observatory]] -->\nLIGO operates two gravitational wave observatories in unison: the LIGO Livingston Observatory ({{Coord|30|33|46.42|N|90|46|27.27|W}}) in [[Livingston, Louisiana]], and the LIGO Hanford Observatory, on the [[Hanford Site|DOE Hanford Site]] ({{Coord|46|27|18.52|N|119|24|27.56|W|}}), located near [[Richland, Washington]]. These sites are separated by 3,002 kilometers (1,865 miles) straight line distance through the earth, but 3,030 kilometers (1,883 miles) over the surface. Since gravitational waves are expected to travel at the speed of light, this distance corresponds to a difference in gravitational wave arrival times of up to ten milliseconds. Through the use of [[trilateration]], the difference in arrival times helps to determine the source of the wave, especially when a third similar instrument like [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]], located at an even greater distance in Europe, is added.<ref>{{cite web|title=Location of the Source|url=http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/gwastro/what-are-we-looking-for/4|website=Gravitational Wave Astrophysics|publisher=University of Birmingham|access-date=28 November 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208133633/http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/gwastro/what-are-we-looking-for/4|archive-date=8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nEach observatory supports an L-shaped [[ultra high vacuum]] system, measuring four kilometers (2.5 miles) on each side. Up to five [[interferometer]]s can be set up in each vacuum system.\n\nThe LIGO Livingston Observatory houses one laser [[interferometer]] in the primary configuration. This interferometer was successfully upgraded in 2004 with an active vibration isolation system based on hydraulic actuators providing a factor of 10 isolation in the 0.1\u20135&nbsp;Hz band. Seismic vibration in this band is chiefly due to [[microseismic]] waves and anthropogenic sources (traffic, logging, etc.).\n\nThe LIGO Hanford Observatory houses one interferometer, almost identical to the one at the Livingston Observatory. During the Initial and Enhanced LIGO phases, a half-length interferometer operated in parallel with the main interferometer. For this 2&nbsp;km interferometer, the [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot]] arm cavities had the same optical finesse, and, thus, half the storage time as the 4&nbsp;km interferometers. With half the storage time, the theoretical strain sensitivity was as good as the full length interferometers above 200&nbsp;Hz but only half as good at low frequencies. During the same era, Hanford retained its original passive seismic isolation system due to limited geologic activity in Southeastern Washington.\n\n==Operation==\n{{gravitational_wave_observatory_principle.svg}}\nThe parameters in this section refer to the [[#Advanced LIGO|Advanced LIGO]] experiment.\nThe primary interferometer consists of two beam lines of 4&nbsp;km length which form a power-recycled [[Michelson interferometer]] with [[Gires\u2013Tournois etalon]] arms.  A pre-stabilized 1064&nbsp;nm [[Nd:YAG laser]] emits a beam with a power of 20 W that passes through a power recycling mirror. The mirror fully transmits light incident from the laser and reflects light from the other side increasing the power of the light field between the mirror and the subsequent beam splitter to 700 W. From the beam splitter the light travels along two orthogonal arms. By the use of partially reflecting mirrors, [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer|Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavities]] are created in both arms that increase the effective path length of laser light in the arm. The power of the light field in the cavity is 100&nbsp;kW.<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\" />\n\nWhen a gravitational wave passes through the interferometer, the spacetime in the local area is altered. Depending on the source of the wave and its polarization, this results in an effective change in length of one or both of the cavities. The effective length change between the beams will cause the light currently in the cavity to become very slightly out of [[Phase (waves)|phase]] (antiphase) with the incoming light. The cavity will therefore periodically get very slightly out of [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]] and the beams, which are tuned to [[Interference (wave propagation)|destructively interfere]] at the detector, will have a very slight periodically varying detuning. This results in a measurable signal.<ref>\n{{cite web | author = Thorne, Kip| title = Chapter 27.6: The Detection of Gravitational Waves (in \"Applications of Classical Physics chapter 27: Gravitational Waves and Experimental Tests of General Relativity\", Caltech lecture notes) |url = http://www.pmaweb.caltech.edu/Courses/ph136/yr2012/1227.1.K.pdf | year=2012 | access-date=11 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter an equivalent of approximately 280 trips down the 4&nbsp;km length to the far mirrors and back again,<ref>{{cite web | title = LIGO's Interferometer | url = https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/ligos-ifo }}</ref> the two separate beams leave the arms and recombine at the beam splitter. The beams returning from two arms are kept out of phase so that when the arms are both in coherence and interference (as when there is no gravitational wave passing through), their light waves subtract, and no light should arrive at the [[photodiode]]. When a gravitational wave passes through the interferometer, the distances along the arms of the interferometer are shortened and lengthened, causing the beams to become slightly less out of phase. This results in the beams coming in phase, creating a [[resonance]], hence, some light arrives at the photodiode, indicating a signal. Light that does not contain a signal is returned to the interferometer using a power recycling mirror, thus increasing the power of the light in the arms. In actual operation, noise sources can cause movement in the optics which produces similar effects to real gravitational wave signals; a great deal of the art and complexity in the instrument is in finding ways to reduce these spurious motions of the mirrors.  Observers compare signals from both sites to reduce the effects of noise.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Doughton|first1=Sandi|title=Suddenly there came a tapping: Ravens cause blips in massive physics instrument at Hanford|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/science/suddenly-there-came-a-tapping-ravens-cause-blips-in-massive-physics-instrument-at-hanford/|access-date=14 May 2018|work=The Seattle Times|date=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Observations==\n[[File:LIGO on Hanford Reservation.jpg|thumb|300px|Western leg of LIGO [[interferometer]] on [[Hanford Reservation]]]]\n{{see also|First observation of gravitational waves|List of gravitational wave observations}}\nBased on current models of astronomical events, and the predictions of the [[general theory of relativity]],{{r|Pretorius2005|CampanelliLousto2006|BakerCentrella2006}} gravitational waves that originate tens of millions of light years from Earth are expected to distort the {{convert|4|km|adj=on}} mirror spacing by about {{val|e=\u221218|u=m}}, less than one-thousandth the [[charge radius|charge diameter]] of a [[proton]].  Equivalently, this is a relative change in distance of approximately one part in {{10^|21}}.  A typical event which might cause a detection event would be the late stage inspiral and merger of two 10-[[solar-mass]] black holes, not necessarily located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is expected to result in a very specific sequence of signals often summarized by the slogan ''chirp,'' ''burst,'' ''quasi-normal mode ringing,'' ''exponential decay.''\n\nIn their fourth Science Run at the end of 2004, the LIGO detectors demonstrated sensitivities in measuring these displacements to within a factor of two of their design.\n\nDuring LIGO's fifth Science Run in November 2005, sensitivity reached the primary design specification of a detectable strain of one part in {{10^|21}} over a {{val|100|u=Hz}} bandwidth. The baseline inspiral of two roughly solar-mass neutron stars is typically expected to be observable if it occurs within about {{convert|8|e6pc|e6ly|lk=on}}, or the vicinity of the [[Local Group]], averaged over all directions and polarizations. Also at this time, LIGO and [[GEO 600]] (the German-UK interferometric detector) began a joint science run, during which they collected data for several months. [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] (the French-Italian interferometric detector) joined in May 2007. The fifth science run ended in 2007, after extensive analysis of data from this run did not uncover any unambiguous detection events.\n\nIn February 2007, GRB&nbsp;070201, a short [[gamma-ray burst]] arrived at Earth from the direction of the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].  The prevailing explanation of most short gamma-ray bursts is the merger of a neutron star with either a neutron star or a black hole. LIGO reported a non-detection for GRB&nbsp;070201, ruling out a merger at the distance of Andromeda with high confidence. Such a constraint was predicated on LIGO eventually demonstrating a direct detection of gravitational waves.<ref>{{cite press release |title=LIGO Sheds Light on Cosmic Event |first=Kathy |last=Svitil

The LIGO Laboratory, in collaboration with the [[National Science Foundation|US National Science Foundation]] and Advanced LIGO partners from the U.K., Germany and Australia, has offered to provide all of the designs and hardware for one of the three planned Advanced LIGO detectors to be installed, commissioned, and operated by an Indian team of scientists in a facility to be built in India.\n\nThe LIGO-India project is a collaboration between LIGO Laboratory and the LIGO-India consortium: Institute of Plasma Research, Gandhinagar; IUCAA (Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics), Pune and Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore.\n\nThe expansion of worldwide activities in gravitational-wave detection to produce an effective global network has been a goal of LIGO for many years. In 2010, a developmental roadmap<ref name=\"gwic2010\">{{cite web |title=The future of gravitational wave astronomy |url=https://gwic.ligo.org/roadmap/Roadmap_100814.pdf |publisher=Gravitational Waves International Committee |access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref> issued by the [[Gravitational Wave International Committee|Gravitational Wave International Committee (GWIC)]] recommended that an expansion of the global array of interferometric detectors be pursued as a highest priority. Such a network would afford astrophysicists with more robust search capabilities and higher scientific yields. The current agreement between the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo collaboration links three detectors of comparable sensitivity and forms the core of this international network. Studies indicate that the localization of sources by a network that includes a detector in India would provide significant improvements.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://dcc.ligo.org/cgi-bin/DocDB/ShowDocument?docid=90988 |title=Improved Source Localization with LIGO India |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=484 |issue=1 |pages=012007 |date=28 September 2012 |first=Stephen |last=Fairhurst |id=LIGO document P1200054-v6|bibcode=2014JPhCS.484a2007F |arxiv=1205.6611 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/484/1/012007 |s2cid=118583506 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |arxiv=1102.5421 |title=Networks of Gravitational Wave Detectors and Three Figures of Merit |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |volume=28 |issue=12 |pages=125023 |date=25 April 2011 |first=Bernard F. |last=Schutz|bibcode = 2011CQGra..28l5023S |doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/28/12/125023 |s2cid=119247573 }}</ref> Improvements in localization averages are predicted to be approximately an order of magnitude, with substantially larger improvements in certain regions of the sky.\n\nThe [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] was willing to permit this relocation, and its consequent schedule delays, as long as it did not increase the LIGO budget.
