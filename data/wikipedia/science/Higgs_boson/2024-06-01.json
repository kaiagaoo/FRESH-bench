Its \"[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking#Sombrero potential|Sombrero potential]]\" leads it to take a nonzero value ''everywhere'' (including otherwise empty space), which [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|breaks]] the [[weak isospin]] symmetry of the [[electroweak interaction]] and, via the [[Higgs mechanism]], gives a rest mass to all massive elementary particles of the Standard Model, including the Higgs boson itself.\n\nBoth the field and the boson are named after physicist [[Peter Higgs]], who in 1964, [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|along with five other scientists]] in three teams, proposed the [[Higgs mechanism]], a way for [[mass generation|some particles to acquire mass]]. (All fundamental particles known at the time{{efn|In Higgs-based theories, the Higgs boson itself should be an exception, being massive even at high energies.}} should be massless at very high energies, but fully explaining how some particles gain mass at lower energies had been extremely difficult.) If these ideas were correct, a particle known as a scalar [[boson]] should also exist (with certain properties). This particle was called the Higgs boson and could be used to test whether the Higgs field was the correct explanation.\n\nAfter a [[Search for the Higgs boson|40-year search]], a subatomic particle with the expected properties was discovered in 2012 by the [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at [[CERN]] near [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The new particle was subsequently confirmed to match the expected properties of a Higgs boson. Physicists from two of the three teams, Peter Higgs and [[Fran\u00e7ois Englert]], were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2013 for their theoretical predictions. Although Higgs's name has come to be associated with this theory, several researchers between about 1960 and 1972 independently developed different parts of it.\n\nIn the media, the Higgs boson is sometimes called the \"'''God particle'''\" after the 1993 book ''[[The God Particle (book)|The God Particle]]'' by Nobel Laureate [[Leon Lederman]].<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Leon M.

(A separate theory, [[general relativity]], is used for gravity.) In the Standard Model, the particles and forces in nature (aside from gravity) arise from properties of [[quantum field]]s known as [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge invariance]] and [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. Forces in the Standard Model are [[force carrier|transmitted by particles]] known as [[gauge boson]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=49\u201352}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=603\u2013604}}</ref>\n\n=== Gauge invariant theories and symmetries ===\n: ''\"It is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry\"'' \u2013 [[Philip W. Anderson|Philip Anderson]], Nobel Prize Physics<ref>From P.W. Anderson (1972) \"More is different\", Science.</ref>\n\n[[Introduction to gauge theory|Gauge invariant theories]] are theories which have a useful feature; some kinds of changes to the value of certain items do not make any difference to the outcomes or the measurements we make. An example: changing [[voltage]]s in an [[electromagnet]] by +100&nbsp;volts does not cause any change to the [[magnetic field]] it produces. Similarly, measuring the [[speed of light]] in vacuum seems to give the identical result, whatever the location in time and space, and whatever the local [[gravitational field]].\n\nIn these kinds of theories, the gauge is an item whose value we can change. The fact that some changes leave the results we measure unchanged means it is a gauge invariant theory, and symmetries are the specific kinds of changes to the gauge which have the effect of leaving measurements unchanged. Symmetries of this kind are powerful tools for a deep understanding of the fundamental forces and particles of our physical world. Gauge invariance is therefore an important property within particle physics theory. They are closely connected to [[conservation law]]s and are described mathematically using [[group theory]]. Quantum field theory and the Standard Model are both gauge invariant theories \u2013 meaning they focus on properties of our universe, demonstrating this property of gauge invariance and the symmetries which are involved.\n\n=== Gauge boson (rest) mass problem ===\nQuantum field theories based on gauge invariance had been used with great success in understanding the [[electromagnetic field|electromagnetic]] and [[strong force]]s, but by around 1960, all attempts to create a ''gauge invariant'' theory for the [[weak force]] (and its combination with the electromagnetic force, known together as the [[electroweak interaction]]) had consistently failed. As a result of these failures, gauge theories began to fall into disrepute. The problem was [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry requirements]] for these two forces incorrectly predicted the weak force's gauge bosons ([[W and Z bosons|W and Z]]) would have \"zero mass\" (in the specialized terminology of particle physics, \"mass\" refers specifically to a particle's ''rest mass''). But experiments showed the W and Z gauge bosons had non-zero (rest) mass.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=372\u2013373}}</ref>\n\nFurther, many promising solutions seemed to require the existence of extra particles known as [[Goldstone boson]]s. But evidence suggested these did not exist either. This meant either gauge invariance was an incorrect approach, or something unknown was giving the weak force's W and Z bosons their mass, and doing it in a way that did not create Goldstone bosons. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, physicists were at a loss as to how to resolve these issues, or how to create a comprehensive theory for particle physics.\n\n=== Symmetry breaking ===\nIn the late 1950s, [[Yoichiro Nambu]] recognised that [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], a process where a symmetric system becomes asymmetric, could occur under certain conditions.{{efn|\nIn physics, it is possible for a [[scientific law|law]] to hold true only if certain assumptions hold true, or when certain conditions are met. For example, [[Newton's laws of motion]] only apply at speeds where [[Special relativity|relativistic effects]] are negligible; and laws related to conductivity, gases, and classical physics (as opposed to quantum mechanics) may apply only within certain ranges of size, temperature, pressure, or other conditions.\n}}\nSymmetry breaking is when some variable that previously ''didn't'' affect the measured results (''it was originally a \"symmetry\"'') now ''does'' affect the measured results (''it's now \"broken\" and no longer a symmetry''). In 1962 physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]], an expert in [[condensed matter physics]], observed that symmetry breaking played a role in [[superconductivity]], and suggested it could also be part of the answer to the problem of gauge invariance in particle physics.\n\nSpecifically, Anderson suggested that the [[Goldstone boson]]s that would result from symmetry breaking might instead, in some circumstances, be \"absorbed\"{{efn|\nIn theoretical particle physics, one says that particle {{sc|A}} \"absorbs\" particle {{sc|B}} when they always act simultaneously, and their combined effect cannot be separated using observables: Although the mathematical description of the process may have two parts, {{sc|A}} and {{sc|B}}, the observed preconditions and their outcomes are indistinguishable from the interaction of what appears to effectively be a single particle (which usually is given another, slightly different name; for example one of the combinations of the theoretical {{math|W{{sub|3}}}} and {{math|B{{sup|0}}}} [[electroweak]] bosons is called the [[Z boson]]).\n}}\nby the massless [[W and Z bosons]]. If so, perhaps the Goldstone bosons would not exist, and the W and Z bosons could [[mass generation|gain mass]], solving both problems at once. Similar behaviour was already theorised in superconductivity.<ref name=woit/> In 1964, this was shown to be theoretically possible by physicists [[Abraham Klein (physicist)|Abraham Klein]] and [[Benjamin W. Lee|Benjamin Lee]], at least for some limited ([[special relativity|non-relativistic]]) cases.<ref name=Klein-Lee-1964/>\n\n=== Higgs mechanism ===\n{{Main|Higgs mechanism|Standard Model}}\nFollowing the 1963<ref name=Anderson-1963/> and early 1964<ref name=Klein-Lee-1964/> papers, three groups of researchers independently developed these theories more completely, in what became known as the [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers]]. All three groups reached similar conclusions and for all cases, not just some limited cases. They showed that the conditions for electroweak symmetry would be \"broken\" if an unusual type of [[field (physics)|field]] existed throughout the universe, and indeed, there would be no Goldstone bosons and some existing bosons would [[mass generation|acquire mass]].\n\nThe field required for this to happen (which was purely hypothetical at the time) became known as the ''Higgs field'' (after [[Peter Higgs]], one of the researchers) and the mechanism by which it led to symmetry breaking, known as the ''[[Higgs mechanism]]''. A key feature of the necessary field is that it would take ''less'' energy for the field to have a non-zero value than a zero value, unlike all other known fields, therefore, the Higgs field has a non-zero value (or ''[[Vacuum expectation value|vacuum expectation]]'') ''everywhere''. This non-zero value could in theory break electroweak symmetry. It was the first proposal capable of showing how the weak force gauge bosons could have mass despite their governing symmetry, within a gauge invariant theory.\n\nAlthough these ideas did not gain much initial support or attention, by 1972 they had been developed into a comprehensive theory and proved capable of giving [[renormalization|\"sensible\" results]] that accurately described particles known at the time, and which, with exceptional accuracy, [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predicted several other particles discovered during the following years]].{{efn|name=\"predictions\"|\nThe success of the Higgs-based electroweak theory and Standard Model is illustrated by their [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predictions]] of the mass of two particles later detected: the W boson (predicted mass: {{val|80.390|0.018|u=GeV/c2}}, experimental measurement: {{val|80.387|0.019|u=GeV/c2}}), and the Z boson (predicted mass: {{val|91.1874|0.0021|u=GeV/c2}}, experimental measurement: {{val|91.1876|0.0021|u=GeV/c2}}). Other accurate predictions included the [[weak neutral current]], the [[gluon]], and the [[top quark|top]] and [[charm quark]]s, all later proven to exist as the theory said.\n}}\nDuring the 1970s these theories rapidly became the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics.\n\n=== Higgs field ===\nTo allow symmetry breaking, the Standard Model includes a [[field (physics)|field]] of the kind needed to \"break\" electroweak symmetry and give particles their correct mass. This field, which became known as the \"Higgs Field\", was hypothesized to exist throughout space, and to break some symmetry laws of the [[electroweak interaction]], triggering the Higgs mechanism. It, therefore, would cause the W and Z gauge bosons of the weak force to be massive at all temperatures below an extremely high value.{{efn|Electroweak symmetry is broken by the Higgs field in its lowest energy state, called its ''[[ground state]]''. At high energy levels this does not happen, and the gauge bosons of the weak force would be expected to become massless above those energy levels.}}\nWhen the weak force bosons acquire mass, this affects the distance they can freely travel, which becomes very small, also matching experimental findings.{{efn|\nname=massvsrange|\nThe range of a force is inversely proportional to the mass of the particles transmitting it.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Shu |first=F.

The movement and interactions of these particles with each other are limited by the energy\u2013time [[uncertainty principle]]. As a result, the more massive a single virtual particle is, the greater its energy, and therefore the shorter the distance it can travel. A particle's mass therefore, determines the maximum distance at which it can interact with other particles and on any force it mediates. By the same token, the reverse is also true: Massless and near-massless particles can carry long distance forces.\n:\nSince experiments have shown that the weak force acts over only a very short range, this implies that massive gauge bosons must exist, and indeed, their masses have since been confirmed by measurement.\n:\n''(See also: [[Compton wavelength]] and [[static forces and virtual-particle exchange]])'' }}\nFurthermore, it was later realised that the same field would also explain, in a different way, why other fundamental constituents of matter (including [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s) have mass.\n\nUnlike all other known fields, such as the [[electromagnetic field]], the Higgs field is a [[scalar field]], and has a non-zero average value in [[Vacuum state|vacuum]].\n\n=== The \"central problem\" ===\nThere was not yet any direct evidence that the Higgs field existed, but even without direct proof, the accuracy of its predictions led scientists to believe the theory might be true. By the 1980s, the question of whether the Higgs field existed, and therefore whether the entire Standard Model was correct, had come to be regarded as one of the most important [[Unanswered questions in physics|unanswered questions in particle physics]].\n\nFor many decades, scientists had no way to determine whether the Higgs field existed because the technology needed for its detection did not exist at that time. If the Higgs field did exist, then it would be unlike any other known fundamental field, but it also was possible that these key ideas, or even the entire Standard Model, were somehow incorrect.{{efn|By the 1960s, many had already started to see gauge theories as failing to explain particle physics, because theorists had been unable to solve the mass problem or even explain how gauge theory could provide a solution. So the idea that the Standard Model \u2013 which relied on a Higgs field, not yet proved to exist \u2013 could be fundamentally incorrect, was not unreasonable.\n:\nAgainst this, once the model was developed around 1972, no better theory existed, and its predictions and solutions were so accurate, that it became the preferred theory anyway. It then became crucial to science, to know whether it was ''correct''.\n}}\n\nThe existence of the Higgs field became the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics, and for several decades was considered \"the central problem in particle physics\".<ref name=Proceedings_1986/><ref name=Higgs_Hunters_Guide/>\n\nThe hypothesised Higgs theory made several key predictions.{{efn|name=predictions}}<ref name=\"L&T\"/>{{rp|22}} One crucial prediction was that a matching [[subatomic particle|particle]], called the \"Higgs boson\", should also exist. Proving the existence of the Higgs boson would prove whether the Higgs field existed, and therefore finally prove whether the Standard Model's explanation was correct. Therefore, there was an extensive [[search for the Higgs boson]], as a way to prove the Higgs field itself existed.<ref name=OnyisiFAQ/><ref name=strasslerFAQ2/>\n\n=== Search and discovery ===\nAlthough the Higgs field would exist everywhere, proving its existence was far from easy. In principle, it can be proved to exist by detecting its [[excited state|excitations]], which manifest as Higgs particles (the ''Higgs boson''), but these are extremely difficult to produce and detect due to the energy required to produce them and their very rare production even if the energy is sufficient.

The importance of the Higgs boson largely is that it is able to be examined using existing knowledge and experimental technology, as a way to confirm and study the entire Higgs field theory.<ref name=\"OnyisiFAQ\" /><ref name=\"strasslerFAQ2\" /> Conversely, proof that the Higgs field and boson did ''not'' exist would have also been significant.\n\n=== Particle physics ===\n==== Validation of the Standard Model ====\nThe Higgs boson validates the [[Standard Model]] through the mechanism of [[mass generation]]. As more precise measurements of its properties are made, more advanced extensions may be suggested or excluded. As experimental means to measure the field's behaviours and interactions are developed, this fundamental field may be better understood. If the Higgs field had not been discovered, the Standard Model would have needed to be modified or superseded.\n\nRelated to this, a belief generally exists among physicists that there is likely to be \"new\" [[physics beyond the Standard Model]], and the Standard Model will at some point be extended or superseded. The Higgs discovery, as well as the many measured collisions occurring at the LHC, provide physicists a sensitive tool to search their data for any evidence that the Standard Model seems to fail, and could provide considerable evidence guiding researchers into future theoretical developments.\n\n==== Symmetry breaking of the electroweak interaction ====\nBelow an extremely high temperature, [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] causes the [[electroweak interaction]] to manifest in part as the short-ranged [[weak force]], which is carried by massive [[gauge boson]]s. In the [[Chronology of the universe|history of the universe]], electroweak symmetry breaking is believed to have happened at about {{nowrap|1 [[picosecond]] (10<sup>\u221212</sup> s)}} after the [[Big Bang]], when the universe was at a temperature {{val|159.5|1.5|u=[[Electronvolt#Temperature|GeV/''k''<sub>B</sub>]]}}.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1 = D'Onofrio |first1=Michela\n |last2 = Rummukainen |first2=Kari\n |title = Standard model cross-over on the lattice\n |journal = Phys.

Occasionally, although rarely, a Higgs boson will be created fleetingly as part of the collision byproducts. Because the Higgs boson [[#Decay|decays]] very quickly, particle detectors cannot detect it directly. Instead the detectors register all the decay products (the ''decay signature'') and from the data the decay process is reconstructed. If the observed decay products match a possible decay process (known as a ''decay channel'') of a Higgs boson, this indicates that a Higgs boson may have been created. In practice, many processes may produce similar decay signatures. Fortunately, the Standard Model precisely predicts the likelihood of each of these, and each known process, occurring. So, if the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching a Higgs boson than would otherwise be expected if Higgs bosons did not exist, then this would be strong evidence that the Higgs boson exists.\n\nBecause Higgs boson production in a particle collision is likely to be very rare (1 in 10 billion at the LHC),{{efn|name=\"production_rate\"|\nThe example is based on the production rate at the LHC operating at 7&nbsp;TeV. The total cross-section for producing a Higgs boson at the LHC is about 10&nbsp;[[picobarn]],<ref name=HprodLHC/> while the total cross-section for a proton\u2013proton collision is 110&nbsp;[[millibarn]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Collisions\n |series=LHC machine outreach\n |publisher=[[CERN]]\n |url=http://lhc-machine-outreach.web.cern.ch/lhc-machine-outreach/collisions.htm\n |access-date=26 July 2012 |url-status=live\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326021534/https://lhc-machine-outreach.web.cern.ch/lhc-machine-outreach/collisions.htm\n |archive-date=26 March 2020\n}}\n</ref>\n}}\nand many other possible collision events can have similar decay signatures, the data of hundreds of trillions of collisions needs to be analysed and must \"show the same picture\" before a conclusion about the existence of the Higgs boson can be reached. To conclude that a new particle has been found, [[particle physicist]]s require that the [[statistical analysis]] of two independent particle detectors each indicate that there is less than a one-in-a-million chance that the observed decay signatures are due to just background random Standard Model events{{snd}} i.e., that the observed number of events is more than five [[standard deviation]]s (sigma) different from that expected if there was no new particle. More collision data allows better confirmation of the physical properties of any new particle observed, and allows physicists to decide whether it is indeed a Higgs boson as described by the Standard Model or some other hypothetical new particle.\n\nTo find the Higgs boson, a powerful [[particle accelerator]] was needed, because Higgs bosons might not be seen in lower-energy experiments. The collider needed to have a high [[Luminosity (scattering theory)|luminosity]] in order to ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions to be drawn.

However, before [[Sheldon Glashow]] extended the [[electroweak unification]] models in 1961, there were great difficulties in developing gauge theories for the [[weak nuclear force]] or a possible unified [[electroweak interaction]]. [[Fermion]]s with a mass term would violate gauge symmetry and therefore cannot be gauge invariant. (This can be seen by examining the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Dirac Lagrangian]] for a fermion in terms of left and right handed components; we find none of the spin-half particles could ever flip [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] as required for mass, so they must be massless.{{efn|\nIn the Standard Model, the mass term arising from the Dirac Lagrangian for any fermion <math>\\psi</math> is <math>-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi</math>. This is ''not'' invariant under the electroweak symmetry, as can be seen by writing <math>\\psi</math> in terms of left and right handed components:\n: <math>-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi \\,=\\, -m\\left(\\bar{\\psi}_L\\psi_R + \\bar{\\psi}_R\\psi_L\\right)</math>\ni.e., contributions from <math>\\bar{\\psi}_L\\psi_L</math> and <math>\\bar{\\psi}_R\\psi_R</math> terms do not appear. We see that the mass-generating interaction is achieved by constant flipping of particle [[chirality]]. Since the spin-half particles have no right/left helicity pair with the same [[SU(2)]] and [[SU(3)]] representation and the same weak hypercharge, then assuming these gauge charges are conserved in the vacuum, none of the spin-half particles could ever swap helicity. Therefore, in the absence of some other cause, all fermions must be massless.\n}})\n[[W and Z bosons]] are observed to have mass, but a boson mass term contains terms which clearly depend on the choice of gauge, and therefore these masses too cannot be gauge invariant. Therefore, it seems that ''none'' of the standard model fermions ''or'' bosons could \"begin\" with mass as an inbuilt property except by abandoning gauge invariance. If gauge invariance were to be retained, then these particles had to be acquiring their mass by some other mechanism or interaction.\n\nAdditionally, solutions based on spontaneous symmetry breaking appeared to fail, seemingly an inevitable result of [[Goldstone's theorem]]. Because there is no potential energy cost to moving around the complex plane's \"circular valley\" responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking, the resulting quantum excitation is pure kinetic energy, and therefore a massless boson (\"Goldstone boson\"), which in turn implies a new long range force. But no new long range forces or massless particles were detected either. So whatever was giving these particles their mass had to not \"break\" gauge invariance as the basis for other parts of the theories where it worked well, ''and'' had to not require or predict unexpected massless particles or long-range forces which did not actually seem to exist in nature.\n\nA solution to all of these overlapping problems came from the discovery of a previously unnoticed borderline case hidden in the mathematics of Goldstone's theorem,{{efn|name=GoldstoneNote|\n[[Goldstone's theorem]] only applies to gauges having [[Lorentz covariance|manifest Lorentz covariance]], a condition that took time to become questioned. But the process of [[quantization (physics)|quantisation]]<!-- BRITISH ENGLISH SPELLING --> requires a [[gauge fixing|gauge to be fixed]] and at this point it becomes possible to choose a gauge such as the 'radiation' gauge which is not invariant over time, so that these problems can be avoided. According to {{harvp|Bernstein |1974|p=8}}:\n{{blockquote|the \"radiation gauge\" condition {{nowrap|\u2207\u22c5A({{mvar|x}}) {{=}} 0}} is clearly not covariant, which means that if we wish to maintain transversality of the photon in all [[Lorentz frame]]s, the [[photon field]] A<sub>\u03bc</sub>({{mvar|x}}) cannot transform like a [[four-vector]]. This is no catastrophe, since the photon ''field'' is not an [[observable]], and one can readily show that the S-matrix elements, which ''are'' observable have covariant structures. ... in gauge theories one might arrange things so that one had a symmetry breakdown because of the noninvariance of the vacuum; but, because the Goldstone ''et al.'' proof breaks down, the zero mass Goldstone mesons need not appear. [''emphasis in original'']}} {{harvp|Bernstein|1974}} contains an accessible and comprehensive background and review of this area, see [[#External links|external links]].\n}}\nthat under certain conditions it ''might'' theoretically be possible for a symmetry to be broken ''without'' disrupting gauge invariance and ''without'' any new massless particles or forces, and having \"sensible\" ([[renormalization|renormalisable]]) results mathematically. This became known as the [[Higgs mechanism]].\n\n[[File:Elementary particle interactions.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|Summary of interactions between certain [[elementary particle|particles]] described by the [[Standard Model]]]]\nThe Standard Model hypothesises a [[Quantum field theory|field]] which is responsible for this effect, called the Higgs field (symbol: <math>\\phi</math>), which has the unusual property of a non-zero amplitude in its [[ground state]]; i.e., a non-zero [[vacuum expectation value]]. It can have this effect because of its unusual \"Mexican hat\" shaped potential whose lowest \"point\" is not at its \"centre\". In simple terms, unlike all other known fields, the Higgs field requires ''less'' energy to have a non-zero value than a zero value, so it ends up having a non-zero value ''everywhere''. Below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this non-zero vacuum expectation [[symmetry breaking|spontaneously breaks]] electroweak [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge symmetry]] which in turn gives rise to the Higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field. This effect occurs because [[scalar field]] components of the Higgs field are \"absorbed\" by the massive bosons as [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], and couple to the fermions via [[Yukawa coupling]], thereby producing the expected mass terms. When symmetry breaks under these conditions, the [[Goldstone boson]]s that arise ''interact'' with the Higgs field (and with other particles capable of interacting with the Higgs field) instead of becoming new massless particles. The intractable problems of both underlying theories \"neutralise\" each other, and the residual outcome is that elementary particles acquire a consistent mass based on how strongly they interact with the Higgs field. It is the simplest known process capable of giving mass to the [[gauge boson]]s while remaining compatible with [[gauge theories]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peskin|Schroeder|1995|pp=717\u2013719, 787\u2013791}}</ref> Its [[quantum]] would be a [[scalar boson]], known as the Higgs boson.<ref>{{harvnb|Peskin|Schroeder|1995|pp=715\u2013716 }}</ref>\n\n=== Simple explanation of the theory, from its origins in superconductivity ===\nThe proposed Higgs mechanism arose as a result of theories proposed to explain observations in [[superconductivity]]. A superconductor does not allow penetration by external magnetic fields (the [[Meissner effect]]). This strange observation implies that somehow, the electromagnetic field becomes short ranged during this phenomenon. Successful theories arose to explain this during the 1950s, first for fermions ([[Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory]], 1950), and then for bosons ([[BCS theory]], 1957).\n\nIn these theories, superconductivity is interpreted as arising from a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|charged condensate]] field. Initially, the condensate value does not have any preferred direction, implying it is scalar, but its [[Phase (waves)|phase]] is capable of defining a gauge, in gauge based field theories. To do this, the field must be charged. A charged scalar field must also be complex (or described another way, it contains at least two components, and a symmetry capable of rotating each into the other(s)). In na\u00efve gauge theory, a gauge transformation of a condensate usually rotates the phase. But in these circumstances, it instead fixes a preferred choice of phase. However, it turns out that fixing the choice of gauge so that the condensate has the same phase everywhere also causes the electromagnetic field to gain an extra term. This extra term causes the electromagnetic field to become short range.\n\nOnce attention was drawn to this theory within particle physics, the parallels were clear. A change of the usually long range electromagnetic field to become short ranged, within a gauge invariant theory, was exactly the needed effect sought for the weak force bosons (because a long range force has massless gauge bosons, and a short ranged force implies massive gauge bosons, suggesting that a result of this interaction is that the field's gauge bosons acquired mass, or a similar and equivalent effect). The features of a field required to do this was also quite well defined \u2013 it would have to be a charged scalar field, with at least two components, and complex in order to support a symmetry able to rotate these into each other.{{efn|\n[[Goldstone's theorem]] also plays a role in such theories. The connection is technically, when a condensate breaks a symmetry, then the state reached by acting with a symmetry generator on the condensate has the same energy as before. This means that some kinds of oscillation will not involve change of energy. Oscillations with unchanged energy imply that excitations (particles) associated with the oscillation are massless. Therefore the outcome is that new massless particles should exist, known as [[Goldstone boson]]s. Because zero mass gauge bosons always mediate long range interactions, a new long range force should exist as well.\n}}\n\n=== Alternative models ===\n{{Main|Alternatives to the Standard Model Higgs}}\n\nThe Minimal Standard Model as described above is the simplest known model for the Higgs mechanism with just one Higgs field. However, an extended Higgs sector with additional Higgs particle doublets or triplets is also possible, and many extensions of the Standard Model have this feature. The non-minimal Higgs sector favoured by theory are the [[Two-Higgs-Doublet Model|two-Higgs-doublet models]] (2HDM), which predict the existence of a [[quintet]] of scalar particles: two [[CP violation|CP-even]] neutral Higgs bosons h<sup>0</sup> and H<sup>0</sup>, a CP-odd neutral Higgs boson A<sup>0</sup>, and two charged Higgs particles H<sup>\u00b1</sup>. [[Supersymmetry]] (\"SUSY\") also predicts relations between the Higgs-boson masses and the masses of the gauge bosons, and could accommodate a {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} neutral Higgs boson.\n\nThe key method to distinguish between these different models involves study of the particles' interactions (\"coupling\") and exact decay processes (\"branching ratios\"), which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions. In the Type-I 2HDM model one Higgs doublet couples to up and down quarks, while the second doublet does not couple to quarks. This model has two interesting limits, in which the lightest Higgs couples to just fermions (\"gauge-[[phobia|phobic]]\") or just gauge bosons (\"fermiophobic\"), but not both. In the Type-II 2HDM model, one Higgs doublet only couples to up-type quarks, the other only couples to down-type quarks.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Branco | first1 = G.

This is seen as theoretically unsatisfactory, particularly as quantum corrections (related to interactions with [[virtual particle]]s) should apparently cause the Higgs particle to have a mass immensely higher than that observed, but at the same time the Standard Model requires a mass [[order of magnitude|of the order of]] {{val|100|to|1000|u=GeV/c2}} to ensure [[unitarity]] (in this case, to unitarise longitudinal vector boson scattering).<ref name=\"Hierarchy problem Quantum Diaries\">{{cite web|title=The Hierarchy Problem: why the Higgs has a snowball's chance in hell|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2012/07/01/the-hierarchy-problem-why-the-higgs-has-a-snowballs-chance-in-hell/|publisher=Quantum Diaries|access-date=19 March 2013|date=1 July 2012|archive-date=29 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329014941/http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2012/07/01/the-hierarchy-problem-why-the-higgs-has-a-snowballs-chance-in-hell/|url-status=live}}</ref> Reconciling these points appears to require explaining why there is an almost-perfect cancellation resulting in the visible mass of ~&nbsp;{{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}, and it is not clear how to do this.

The easiest way to produce a Higgs particle is if the two gluons combine to form a loop of [[virtual particle|virtual]] quarks. Since the coupling of particles to the Higgs boson is proportional to their mass, this process is more likely for heavy particles. In practice it is enough to consider the contributions of virtual [[top quark|top]] and [[bottom quark|bottom]] quarks (the heaviest quarks). This process is the dominant contribution at the LHC and Tevatron being about ten times more likely than any of the other processes.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodTeva\" />\n; Higgs Strahlung: If an elementary [[fermion]] collides with an anti-fermion{{snd}} e.g., a quark with an anti-quark or an [[electron]] with a [[positron]]{{snd}} the two can merge to form a virtual W or Z boson which, if it carries sufficient energy, can then emit a Higgs boson. This process was the dominant production mode at the LEP, where an electron and a positron collided to form a virtual Z boson, and it was the second largest contribution for Higgs production at the Tevatron. At the LHC this process is only the third largest, because the LHC collides protons with protons, making a quark-antiquark collision less likely than at the Tevatron. Higgs Strahlung is also known as ''associated production''.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodTeva\" /><ref name=\"HprodLEP\" />\n; Weak boson fusion: Another possibility when two (anti-)fermions collide is that the two exchange a virtual W or Z boson, which emits a Higgs boson. The colliding fermions do not need to be the same type. So, for example, an [[up quark]] may exchange a Z boson with an anti-down quark. This process is the second most important for the production of Higgs particle at the LHC and LEP.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodLEP\" />\n; Top fusion: The final process that is commonly considered is by far the least likely (by two orders of magnitude).
