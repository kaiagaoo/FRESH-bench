Studies show large amounts of ice there. The ice could contain solid-state compounds that would normally melt under warmer conditions elsewhere on the Moon\u2014compounds which could provide insight into lunar, Earth, and [[Solar System]] history. Mountains and craters create unpredictable lighting that protect the ice from melting, but they also make landing there a challenging undertaking for scientific probes.

The purpose of the experiment was to determine the retroreflector's surface location from the moon's orbit. The Chandrayaan-3 lander's [[Laser retroreflector array|Laser Retroreflector Array]] (LRA) instrument began acting as a location marker close to the lunar south pole. Through multinational cooperation, the LRA was housed on the Vikram lander. On a hemispherical support framework, it consists of eight corner-cube retroreflectors. This array enables any orbiting spacecraft equipped with appropriate instruments to use lasers ranging from different directions. The 20 gram passive optical instrument is intended to survive for several decades on the lunar surface.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n== Objectives ==\nISRO's mission objectives for the Chandrayaan-3 mission are:\n# Engineering and implementing a lander to land safely and softly on the surface of the Moon.\n# Observing and demonstrating the rover's driving capabilities on the Moon.\n# Conducting and observing experiments on the materials available on the lunar surface to better understand the composition of the Moon.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Chandrayaan-3 Details |url=https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3_Details.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230823165138/https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3_Details.html |archive-date=23 August 2023 |access-date=24 August 2023 |website=Indian Space Research Organization}}</ref>\n\n== Spacecraft ==\n=== Design ===\nChandrayaan-3 comprises three main components: a propulsion module, lander module, and rover.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"240\">\nFile:LVM3 M4, Chandrayaan-3 - Render of Encapsulated Payload Fairing with Chandrayaan-3 composite stack.png|Chandrayaan-3 encapsulated within [[LVM3]]'s payload fairing\nFile:Chandrayaan-3 Integrated Module - Views.webp|Chandrayaan-3 integrated components\n</gallery>\n\n==== Propulsion module ====\nThe propulsion module carried the lander and rover configuration to a {{convert|100|km|adj=on}} lunar orbit.
