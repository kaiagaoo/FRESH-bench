Plans to send a spacecraft to Europa were initially conceived with projects such as ''[[Europa Orbiter]]'' and ''[[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]]'', in which a spacecraft would be injected into orbit around Europa. However, due to the adverse effects of [[radiation]] from [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter|Jupiter's magnetosphere]] in Europa orbit, it was decided that it would be safer to inject a spacecraft into an [[Elliptic orbit|elliptical orbit]] around Jupiter and make 44 close flybys of the moon instead. The mission began as a joint investigation between the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) and the [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] (APL), and will be built with a scientific payload of nine instruments contributed by [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], [[Applied Physics Laboratory|APL]], [[Southwest Research Institute]], [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[Arizona State University]] and [[University of Colorado Boulder]]. The mission will complement [[ESA]]'s [[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer]] launching in 2023, which will fly-by Europa twice and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] multiple times before moving into orbit around [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].\n\nThe mission is scheduled to launch in October 2024 aboard a [[Falcon Heavy]],<ref name=\"nasa-202107232\"/> during a 21-day launch window.<ref name='NASA use commercial'/> The spacecraft will use [[gravity assist]]s from Mars in February 2025 and Earth in December 2026, before arriving at Europa in April 2030.<ref name='NASA use commercial'/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Repeated Flybys Yield a Pole-to-Pole View of Europa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|The flybys of Europa by a previous mission collected the data for this mosaic.]]\n\nIn 1997, a ''[[Europa Orbiter]]'' mission was proposed by a team for NASA's [[Discovery Program|Discovery program]]<ref name=\"The Europa Ocean Discovery mission\">{{cite conference|last=Bradley C.

NASA's JPL announced one month after the selection of Discovery proposals that a NASA Europa orbiter mission would be conducted. JPL then invited the Discovery proposal team to be the Mission Review Committee (MRC).{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}\n\nAt the same time as the proposal of the Discovery-class ''Europa Orbiter'' the robotic ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' spacecraft was already orbiting Jupiter. From December 8, 1995, to December 7, 1997 ''Galileo'' conducted the primary mission after entering the orbit of Jupiter. On that final date the Galileo orbiter commenced an extended mission known as the ''Galileo'' Europa Mission (GEM), which ran until December 31, 1999. This was a low-cost mission, with a budget of only US$30 million. The smaller team of about 40\u201350 people (one-fifth the size of the primary mission's 200-person team from 1995\u20131997) did not have the resources to deal with problems, but when they arose it was able to temporarily recall former team members (called \"tiger teams\") for intensive efforts to solve them. The spacecraft made several flybys of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (8), [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] (4) and [[Io (moon)|Io]] (2). On each flyby of the three moons it encountered, the spacecraft collected only two days' worth of data instead of the seven it had collected during the primary mission. This ''Galileo'' Europa Mission was similar to a small-scale version of what the ''Europa Clipper'' is planning to accomplish. GEM included eight flybys of Europa, ranging from {{cvt|196|to|3582|km}}, in two years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meltzer|first=Michael|title=Mission to Jupiter: A History of the ''Galileo''
