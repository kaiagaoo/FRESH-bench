Plans to send a spacecraft to Europa were initially conceived with projects such as ''[[Europa Orbiter]]'' and ''[[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]]'', in which a spacecraft would be injected into orbit around Europa. However, due to the adverse effects of [[radiation]] from [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter|Jupiter's magnetosphere]] in Europa orbit, it was decided that it would be safer to inject a spacecraft into an [[Elliptic orbit|elliptical orbit]] around Jupiter and make 44 close flybys of the moon instead. The mission began as a joint investigation between the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) and the [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] (APL), and will be built with a scientific payload of nine instruments contributed by [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], [[Applied Physics Laboratory|APL]], [[Southwest Research Institute]], [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[Arizona State University]] and [[University of Colorado Boulder]]. The upcoming mission complements [[ESA]]'s [[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer]] launch in 2023, which will fly-by Europa twice and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] multiple times before moving into orbit around [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].\n\nThe mission is scheduled to launch in October 2024 aboard a [[Falcon Heavy]],<ref name=\"nasa-202107232\" /> during a 21-day launch window.<ref name=\"NASA use commercial\" /> The spacecraft will use [[gravity assist]]s from Mars in February 2025 and Earth in December 2026, before arriving at Europa in April 2030.<ref name=\"NASA use commercial\" />\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Repeated Flybys Yield a Pole-to-Pole View of Europa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|The flybys of Europa by a previous mission collected the data for this mosaic.]]\nIn 1997, a ''[[Europa Orbiter]]'' mission was proposed by a team for NASA's [[Discovery Program|Discovery program]]<ref name=\"The Europa Ocean Discovery mission\">{{Cite conference |last1=Edwards |first1=Bradley C. |last2=Chyba |first2=Christopher F. |last3=Abshire |first3=James B. |last4=Burns |first4=Joseph A. |last5=Geissler |first5=Paul |last6=Konopliv |first6=Alex S. |last7=Malin |first7=Michael C. |last8=Ostro |first8=Steven J. |last9=Rhodes |first9=Charley |date=July 11, 1997 |title=The Europa Ocean Discovery mission |conference=Proc.

NASA's JPL announced one month after the selection of Discovery proposals that a NASA Europa orbiter mission would be conducted. JPL then invited the Discovery proposal team to be the Mission Review Committee (MRC).{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}\n\nAt the same time as the proposal of the Discovery-class ''Europa Orbiter'', the robotic ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' spacecraft was already orbiting Jupiter. From December 8, 1995, to December 7, 1997 ''Galileo'' conducted the primary mission after entering the orbit of Jupiter. On that final date, the Galileo orbiter commenced an extended mission known as the ''Galileo'' Europa Mission (GEM), which ran until December 31, 1999. This was a low-cost mission extension, with a budget of only US$30 million. The smaller team of about 40\u201350 people (one-fifth the size of the primary mission's 200-person team from 1995\u20131997) did not have the resources to deal with problems, but when they arose it was able to temporarily recall former team members (called \"tiger teams\") for intensive efforts to solve them. The spacecraft made several flybys of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (8), [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] (4) and [[Io (moon)|Io]] (2). On each flyby of the three moons it encountered, the spacecraft collected only two days' worth of data instead of the seven it had collected during the primary mission. This ''Galileo'' Europa Mission was similar to a small-scale version of what the ''Europa Clipper'' is planning to accomplish. GEM included eight flybys of Europa, ranging from {{cvt|196|to|3582|km}}, in two years.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Michael |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4231/sp4231.pdf |title=Mission to

By sending radio signals between Earth and the moon and characterizing the [[Doppler shift]] in the return signal, scientists at JPL will be able to create a detailed characterization of the spacecraft's motion. This data will help to determine how Europa flexes in relation to its distance from Jupiter, which will in turn reveal information about the moon's internal structure and tidal motions. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Gravity/Radio Science Instruments |url=https://europa.nasa.gov/spacecraft/instruments/gravity-radio-science/ |access-date=November 12, 2022 |publisher=NASA}}</ref>  \n\n* {{small|'''Team lead:''' Erwan Mazarico [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]}}\n\n=== Proposed secondary elements ===\nThe ''Europa Clipper'' mission considered an extra mass of about {{convert|250|kg|lbs}} to carry an additional flight element.<ref name=\"Benedetto 2016\" /> About a dozen proposals have been suggested but none went beyond the concept study phase and none are planned for the Europa Clipper mission.

Linguists collected recordings of the word \"water\" spoken in 103 languages, from families of languages around the world. The audio files were converted into waveforms and etched into the plate. The waveforms radiate out from a symbol representing the [[American Sign Language]] sign for \"water\". Other elements etched on the inwards side together with the poem are the [[Drake Equation]], representations of the [[spectral line]]s of [[Hydrogen atom|atomic hydrogen]] and the [[hydroxyl radical]], together known as the [[Water hole (radio)|water hole]], and a portrait of planetary scientist [[Ron Greeley]].<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA Unveils Design for Message Heading to Jupiter's Moon Europa |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-unveils-design-for-message-heading-to-jupiters-moon-europa |website=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) |access-date=11 March 2024}} {{PD-notice}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://astrobiology.com/2024/03/an-astrobiology-droid-asks-and-answers-how-many-ways-can-you-say-water.html|title=An Astrobiology Droid Asks And Answers 'How Many Ways Can You Say Water'?|first=Keith|last=Cowing|date=March 9, 2024|website=Astrobiology}}</ref> The research organization METI International gathered the audio files for the words for \"water,\" and its president [[Douglas Vakoch]] designed the water hole component of the message.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vakoch |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Vakoch |date=27 March 2024 |title=See the messages NASA is sending to Jupiter's icy moon, Europa |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg26134840-200-see-the-messages-nasa-is-sending-to-jupiters-icy-moon-europa/ |website=[[New Scientist]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Vakoch |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Vakoch |date=March 28, 2024 |title=NASA\u2019s mission to an ice-covered moon will contain a message between water worlds |url=https://theconversation.com/nasas-mission-to-an-ice-covered-moon-will-contain-a-message-between-water-worlds-225771 |website=[[The Conversation (website)]]}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Europa Orbiter}}\n* {{annotated link|Europa Jupiter System Mission \u2013 Laplace}}\n* {{annotated link|Exploration of Jupiter}}\n* {{annotated link|Galileo (spacecraft)}}\n* {{annotated link|Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer}}\n* {{annotated link|Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter}}\n* {{annotated link|Laplace-P}}\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Europa Clipper}}\n* {{Official website|https://europa.nasa.gov/}}\n* [https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/moons/europa NASA - Overview of Europa]\n\n{{Europa Clipper}}\n{{Europa}}\n{{Jupiter}}\n{{Planetary Missions Program Office|Solar System Exploration=y}}\n{{Jupiter spacecraft}}\n{{Mars spacecraft}}\n{{NASA space program}}\n{{Astrobiology}}\n{{Extraterrestrial life}}\n{{Future spaceflights}}\n{{Portalbar|Spaceflight|Astronomy|Biology}}\n\n[[Category:Europa Clipper| ]]\n[[Category:Proposed NASA space probes]]\n[[Category:Proposed astrobiology space missions]]\n[[Category:NASA programs]]\n[[Category:2024 in spaceflight]]\n[[Category:Missions to Jupiter]]\n[[Category:Orbiters (space probe)]]\n[[Category:Europa (moon)]]\n[[Category:Solar System Exploration program]]\n[[Category:Message artifacts]]"}
