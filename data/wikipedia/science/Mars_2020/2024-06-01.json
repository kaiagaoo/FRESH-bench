NASA's Perseverance Rover Sends New Video and Images of the Red Planet |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYQwuYZbA6o |access-date=2024-01-17 |language=en}}</ref> Upon release of this footage, engineers revealed that the rover's parachute contained a puzzle; Internet users had solved it within six hours. The parachute's pattern was based on [[binary code]] and translated to the motto of JPL ([[q:Theodore Roosevelt#The Strenuous Life|Dare Mighty Things]]) and the [[coordinates]] of its headquarters. Irregular patterns are frequently used on spacecraft parachutes to better determine the performance of specific parts of the parachute.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Strickland |first=Ashley |date=2021-02-24 |title=The inspiring hidden message in the Mars Perseverance rover's parachute |url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/24/world/mars-perseverance-parachute-code-scn-trnd/index.html |access-date=2023-12-22 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref>\n\nA small piece of the wing covering from the [[Wright brothers]]' 1903 ''[[Wright Flyer]]'' is attached to a cable underneath ''Ingenuity''{{'}}s solar panel.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Potter|first1=Sean|date=23 May 2021|title=NASA Ingenuity Mars Helicopter Prepares for First Flight|publisher=NASA|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-prepares-for-first-flight}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nNASA scientist [[Swati Mohan]] delivered the news of the successful landing.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaur|first=Harmeet|date=19 February 2021|title=The face of the Perseverance landing was an Indian American woman |publisher=CNN|url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/19/world/swati-mohan-nasa-perseverance-landing-scn-trnd/index.html|access-date=20 February 2021}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ExoMars]], European-Russian Mars exploration program\n* [[Exploration of Mars]]\n* [[List of missions to Mars]]\n* [[Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher]]\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons}}\n* {{official website|http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mars2020/ }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190612114112/https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/ Mars 2020: Assembly \u2013 Overall description] (NASA)\n* [http://mars.nasa.gov/files/m2020/Mars2020FAQs.pdf Mars 2020: Science Definition Team Report] (NASA)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190522184747/https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-invites-public-to-submit-names-to-fly-aboard-next-mars-rover/ Mars 2020: Send Your Name To Mars]\n* [https://Go.nasa.gov/name2020 Mars 2020: Vote for the Name of the Rover]\n* [https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/orrery/#/home Mars 2020: NASA Eyes-on-the-Solar-System]\n\n; Video\n* {{YouTube|cU5MWtEs4L4|Mars 2020: Proposed Science Goals (3:09; July 2013)}}\n* {{YouTube|1cRhU6bMLis|Mars 2020: Rover and Beyond Conference (51:42; July 2014)}}\n* {{YouTube|iZCRFRgSgas|Mars 2020: Next Mission to Mars (8:57; May 2017)}}\n* {{YouTube|2_JJ9gDLwHU|Mars 2020: Building the Mission (3:00; December 2017)}}\n* {{YouTube|As41hXu7xYA|Mars 2020: Building the Rover (3:50; October 2018)}}\n* {{YouTube|qnZ_sidmr4Y|Mars 2020: Jezero crater flyover (2:13; December 2018)}}\n* {{YouTube|j78TwQCfEzc|Mars 2020: Assembly \u2013 (Live stream; since November 2019)}}\n* {{youTube|5qqsMjy8Rx0|Mars 2020: Overview (2:58; July 2020)}}\n* {{YouTube|cGQu5ks34Fs|Mars 2020: LAUNCH of Rover (6:40; 30 July 2020)}}\n* {{YouTube|VWD-nx9gA0o|Mars 2020: LAUNCH of Rover (1:11; 30 July 2020; NASA)}}\n* {{youTube|4czjS9h4Fpg|Mars 2020: LANDING of Rover (3:25; 18 February 2021; NASA)}}\n* [https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/landing/ Mars 2020: LANDING of Rover (3:55pm/et/usa, 18 February 2021]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRrFRL5v0ig Video: Mars ''Perseverance'' rover/''Ingenuity'' helicopter report] [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mars-ingenuity-helicopter-perseverance-rover-60-minutes-2021-05-09/ (9 May 2021; CBS-TV, 60 Minutes; 13:33)]\n\n{{Features and artificial objects on Mars}}\n{{Mars 2020}}\n{{Mars rovers}}\n{{Astrobiology}}\n{{Orbital launches in 2020}}\n{{Mars spacecraft}}\n{{NASA navbox|state=collapsed}}\n{{Solar System probes}}\n{{2020 in space}}\n{{2021 in space}}\n{{portal bar|Astronomy|Biology|Spaceflight}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Mars 2020| ]]\n[[Category:Mars Exploration Program]]\n[[Category:Astrobiology space missions]]\n[[Category:Missions to Mars]]\n[[Category:Space probes launched in 2020]]\n[[Category:2020 in Florida]]\n[[Category:2021 on Mars]]"}
