The NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) in [[Maryland]] managed telescope development, the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] in [[Baltimore]] on the [[Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University]] operates JWST, and the prime contractor was [[Northrop Grumman]]. The [[#Controversy over name|telescope is named]] after [[James E. Webb]], who was the [[List of administrators and deputy administrators of NASA|administrator of NASA]] from 1961 to 1968 during the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] programs.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021 on an [[Ariane 5]] rocket from [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]], and arrived at the Sun\u2013Earth [[L2 point|L<sub>2</sub>]] [[Lagrange point]] in January 2022.

This gives JWST a [[Aperture|light-collecting area]] of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the [[Ultraviolet|near ultraviolet]] and [[visible spectrum|visible]] (0.1 to 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm), and [[Infrared|near infrared]] (0.8\u20132.5&nbsp;\u03bcm)<ref name=CWHT/> spectra, JWST observes in a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible [[light]] (red) through [[infrared|mid-infrared]] (0.6\u201328.3&nbsp;\u03bcm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below {{cvt|50|K|0}}, such that the infrared light [[Black-body radiation|emitted]] by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth L<sub>2</sub> Lagrange point, about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|sp=us}} from Earth, where its five-layer [[Sunshield (JWST)|sunshield]] protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the '''Next Generation Space Telescope''', [[#Background (development to 2003)|began in 1996]]. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays; a major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, with construction completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the telescope's complexity were remarked upon by the media, scientists, and engineers.\n\n== Features ==\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has a mass that is about half of [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s mass.

The NIRSpec design provides three observing modes: a low-resolution mode using a prism, an R~1000 multi-object mode, and an R~2700 integral field unit or long-slit spectroscopy mode. Switching of the modes is done by operating a wavelength preselection mechanism called the Filter Wheel Assembly, and selecting a corresponding dispersive element (prism or grating) using the Grating Wheel Assembly mechanism. Both mechanisms are based on the successful ISOPHOT wheel mechanisms of the [[Infrared Space Observatory]]. The multi-object mode relies on a complex micro-shutter mechanism to allow for simultaneous observations of hundreds of individual objects anywhere in NIRSpec's field of view.

If not, the background heat of the device itself overwhelms the detectors, making it effectively blind. This can be overcome by careful spacecraft design, in particular by placing the telescope in a [[Cryogenic storage dewar|dewar]] with an extremely cold substance, such as [[liquid helium]]. The coolant will slowly vaporize, limiting the lifetime of the instrument from as short as a few months to a few years at most.<ref name=\"ipac.caltech.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/outreach/Edu/orbit.html|title=Infrared astronomy from earth orbit|publisher=Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, NASA Spitzer Science Center, California Institute of Technology|date=2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221020839/http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/outreach/Edu/orbit.html|archive-date=21 December 2016}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, it is possible to maintain a temperature low enough through the design of the spacecraft to enable near-infrared observations without a supply of coolant, such as the extended missions of [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], which operated at reduced capacity after coolant depletion. Another example is Hubble's [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS) instrument, which started out using a block of [[Solid nitrogen|nitrogen ice]] that depleted after a couple of years, but was then replaced during the [[STS-109]] servicing mission with a [[cryocooler]] that worked continuously. The James Webb Space Telescope is designed to cool itself without a dewar, using a combination of sunshields and radiators, with the mid-infrared instrument using an additional cryocooler.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2016-06-cold-cooler-nasa-telescope.html|title=How cold can you go?

total budget was estimated at about US$5 billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|5|2005|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{inflation/fn|US}} In summer 2010, the mission passed its Critical Design Review (CDR) with excellent grades on all technical matters, but schedule and cost slips at that time prompted Maryland U.S. Senator [[Barbara Mikulski]] to call for external review of the project. The Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) chaired by J. Casani (JPL) found that the earliest possible launch date was in late 2015 at an extra cost of US$1.5 billion (for a total of US$6.5 billion). They also pointed out that this would have required extra funding in FY2011 and FY2012 and that any later launch date would lead to a higher total cost.<ref name=\"499224main_JWST-ICRP_Report-FINAL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/499224main_JWST-ICRP_Report-FINAL.pdf|title=Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, Final Report|date=29 October 2010|access-date=10 June 2011|archive-date=17 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211117185346/https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/499224main_JWST-ICRP_Report-FINAL.pdf|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 July 2011, the United States House of Representatives' appropriations committee on Commerce, Justice, and Science moved to cancel the James Webb project by proposing an FY2012 budget that removed US$1.9 billion from NASA's overall budget, of which roughly one quarter was for JWST.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/09/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope|title=Nasa fights to save the James Webb space telescope from the axe|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|first=Robin|last=McKie|date=9 July 2011|access-date=14 December 2016|archive-date=17 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317210545/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/09/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://appropriations.house.gov/news/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=250023|title=Appropriations Committee Releases the Fiscal Year 2012 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations|publisher=US House of representatives Committee on Appropriations|date=6 July 2011|access-date=7 July 2011|archive-date=23 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323111945/http://appropriations.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=250023|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/US_lawmakers_vote_to_kill_Hubble_successor_999.html|title=US lawmakers vote to kill Hubble successor|publisher=SpaceDaily|date=7 July 2011|access-date=8 July 2011|archive-date=10 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710020814/http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/US_lawmakers_vote_to_kill_Hubble_successor_999.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/12187-nasa-budget-bill-cancels-space-telescope-house.html|title=Proposed NASA Budget Bill Would Cancel Major Space Telescope|publisher=Space.com|date=6 July 2011|access-date=11 July 2011|archive-date=9 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709024728/http://www.space.com/12187-nasa-budget-bill-cancels-space-telescope-house.html|url-status=live}}</ref> US$3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bergin|first1=Chris|title=James Webb Space Telescope hardware entering key test phase|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/01/jwst-hardware-entering-test-phase/|publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com|date=7 January 2015|access-date=28 August 2016|archive-date=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107152854/https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/01/jwst-hardware-entering-test-phase/|url-status=live}}</ref> This budget proposal was approved by subcommittee vote the following day.

This allows observation of dimmer, cooler objects. Since water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs most infrared, ground-based infrared astronomy is limited to narrow wavelength ranges where the atmosphere absorbs less strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere itself radiates in the infrared spectrum, often overwhelming light from the object being observed.

The 18 images of HD 84406 are matched to their respective mirror segments, and the 18 segments are brought into approximate alignment centered on the star (\"Segment Image Identification\"). Each segment was then individually corrected of its major focusing errors, using a technique called [[phase retrieval]], resulting in 18 separate good quality images from the 18 mirror segments (\"Segment Alignment\"). The 18 images from each segment, were then moved so they precisely overlap to create a single image (\"Image Stacking\").<ref name=\"Webb blog 2022-02-03\" />\n\nWith the mirrors now positioned for almost correct images, they had to be fine tuned to their operational accuracy of 50 nanometers, less than one [[wavelength]] of the light that will be detected. A technique called ''dispersed fringe sensing'' was used to compare images from 20 pairings of mirrors, allowing most of the errors to be corrected (\"Coarse Phasing\"), and then introduced light defocus to each segment's image, allowing detection and correction of almost all remaining errors (\"Fine Phasing\"). These two processes were repeated three times, and Fine Phasing will be routinely checked throughout the telescope's operation. After three rounds of Coarse and Fine Phasing, the telescope was well aligned at one place in the NIRCam field of view. Measurements will be made at various points in the captured image, across all instruments, and corrections calculated from the detected variations in intensity, giving a well-aligned outcome across all instruments (\"Telescope Alignment Over Instrument Fields of View\"). Finally, a last round of Fine Phasing and checks of image quality on all instruments was performed, to ensure that any small residual errors remaining from the previous steps, were corrected (\"Iterate Alignment for Final Correction\"). The telescope's mirror segments were then aligned and able to capture precise focused images.<ref name=\"Webb blog 2022-02-03\" />\n\nIn preparation for alignment, NASA announced at 19:28 UTC on 3 February 2022, that NIRCam had detected the telescope's first [[photon]]s (although not yet complete images).<ref name=\"Webb blog 2022-02-03\" /><ref name=\"first photons\">{{cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/NASAWebb/status/1489319970324496386|title=Our NIRCam instrument's detectors saw their 1st photons of starlight!
