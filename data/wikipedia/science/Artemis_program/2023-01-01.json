The Artemis program intends to reestablish a human presence on the Moon for the first time since the [[Apollo 17]] mission in 1972. The major components of the program are the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS), [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion spacecraft]], [[Lunar Gateway]] space station and the commercial [[#Human Landing System|Human Landing Systems]]. The program's long-term goal is to establish a [[Colonization of the Moon|permanent base camp on the Moon]] and facilitate [[Human mission to Mars|human missions to Mars]].\n\nThe Artemis programs is a colander of [[List of government space agencies|government space agencies]] and [[private spaceflight]] companies, bound together by the [[Artemis Accords]] and supporting contracts. As of July 2022, twenty-one countries have signed the accords,<ref>{{Cite web |title=NASA: Artemis Accords |url=https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis-accords/index.html |access-date=2022-08-28 |website=NASA}}</ref> including traditional U.S. space partners (such as the [[European Space Agency]] as well as agencies from China, Japan, and the United Kingdom) and emerging space powers such as Russia, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Foust |first=Jeff |date=2021-12-10 |title=Mexico joins Artemis Accords |url=https://spacenews.com/mexico-joins-artemis-accords/ |access-date=2022-08-28 |website=SpaceNews |language=en-US}}</ref> \n\nThe Artemis program was formally established in 2017 during the [[Presidency_of_Donald_Trump|Trump administration]]; however, many of its components such as the Orion spacecraft were developed during the previous [[Constellation program]] (2005\u20132010) during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], and after its cancellation during the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]]. Orion's first launch, and the first use of the Space Launch System, was originally set in 2016, but was rescheduled and launched on 16 November 2022 as the [[Artemis 1]] mission, with robots and mannequins aboard. According to plan, the crewed [[Artemis 2]] launch will take place in 2024, the [[Artemis 3]] crewed lunar landing in 2025, the [[Artemis 4]] docking with the Lunar Gateway in 2027, and future yearly landings on the Moon thereafter. However, some observers note that the program's cost and timeline are likely to be overrun and delayed due to, according to internal and external review, NASA's inadequate management of contractors.<ref name=\":30\">{{Cite web |date=15 November 2021 |title=NASA's management of the Artemis missions |url=https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-22-003.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211115213313/https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-22-003.pdf |archive-date=15 November 2021 |access-date=22 November 2021 |work=[[NASA Office of Inspector General]] |at=\"What We Found\" section at 3th and 4th page}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Davis |first=Jason |date=June 11, 2019 |title=NASA's Artemis program will return astronauts to the moon and give us the first female moonwalker |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/nasa-s-artemis-program-will-return-astronauts-moon-give-us-ncna1015341 |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=NBC News |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Artemis Phase 1.jpg|thumb|Planned missions of Artemis program]]\nThe Artemis program is organized around a series of [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) missions. These space missions will increase in complexity and are scheduled to occur at intervals of a year or more. NASA and its partners have planned Artemis 1 through Artemis 5 missions; later Artemis missions have also been proposed. Each SLS mission centers on the launch of an SLS launch vehicle carrying an [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion spacecraft]]. Missions after [[Artemis 2]] will depend on support missions launched by other organizations and spacecraft for support functions.\n\n===SLS missions===\n[[Artemis 1]] (2022) is an uncrewed test of the SLS and Orion, and is the first test flight for both craft.{{efn|An Orion Capsule was flown in 2014, but not the entire Orion spacecraft.}} The goal of the Artemis 1 mission is to place Orion into a lunar orbit, and then return it to Earth. The SLS uses the [[Delta Cryogenic Second Stage#Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage|ICPS]] second stage, which will perform the trans-lunar injection burn to send Orion to lunar space. Orion will brake into a retrograde distant polar lunar orbit and remain for about six days before boosting back toward Earth. The Orion capsule will separate from its service module, re-enter the atmosphere for [[aerobraking]], and splash down under parachutes.<ref name=\"SFN20200518\">{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Stephen|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/05/18/nasa-will-likely-add-a-rendezvous-test-to-the-first-piloted-orion-space-mission/|title=NASA will likely add a rendezvous test to the first piloted Orion space mission|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=18 May 2020|access-date=19 May 2020|archive-date=8 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200708065618/https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/05/18/nasa-will-likely-add-a-rendezvous-test-to-the-first-piloted-orion-space-mission/|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\n[[Artemis 2]] (2024) will be the first crewed test flight of SLS and the Orion spacecraft.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=Latifiyan |first=Pouya |date=August 2022 |title=Artemis 1 and space communications |journal=Qoqnoos Scientific Magazine |volume=1 |pages=4}}</ref> The four crew members will perform extensive testing in Earth orbit, and Orion will then be boosted into a [[free-return trajectory]] around the Moon, which will return Orion back to Earth for re-entry and splashdown.

After HLS reaches NRHO, SLS/Orion will send the Orion spacecraft with a crew of four, which is intended to include the first woman and the first person of color to land on the Moon, to rendezvous and dock with HLS.{{efn|If an ancillary mission has already delivered Gateway to NRHO, HLS and Orion will dock to Gateway instead of to each other.}} Two astronauts will transfer to HLS, which will descend to the lunar surface and spend about 6.5 days on the surface. The astronauts will perform at least two EVAs on the surface before the HLS ascends to return them to a rendezvous with Orion. Orion will return the four astronauts to Earth. Launch is scheduled no earlier than 2025.<ref>{{cite news |last=Foust |first=Jeff |url=https://spacenews.com/nasa-outlines-plans-for-lunar-lander-development-through-commercial-partnerships/ |title=NASA outlines plans for lunar lander development through commercial partnerships |work=[[SpaceNews]] |date=21 July 2019 |access-date=17 July 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[Artemis 4]] (2027) is a crewed mission to the [[Lunar Gateway]] station in NRHO, using an SLS Block 1B. A prior support mission will deliver the first two gateway modules to NRHO. The extra power of the Block 1B will allow SLS/Orion to deliver the I-HAB gateway module for connection to the Gateway. Launch is scheduled no earlier than 2027.<ref name=\"sn-20221030\" />\n\n[[Artemis 5]] through Artemis 8 and beyond are proposed to land astronauts on the lunar surface, where they will take advantage of increasing amounts of infrastructure that are to be landed by support missions. These will include habitats, rovers, scientific instruments, and resource extraction equipment.<ref name=Sep_2019/>\n\n===Support missions===\nSupport missions include robotic landers, delivery of Gateway modules, Gateway logistics, delivery of the HLS, and delivery of elements of the Moon base. Most of these missions are executed under NASA contracts to commercial providers.\n\nUnder the [[Commercial Lunar Payload Services]] (CLPS) program, several robotic landers will deliver scientific instruments and robotic rovers to the lunar surface after Artemis 1. Additional CLPS missions are planned throughout the Artemis program to deliver payloads to the Moon base. These include habitat modules and rovers in support of crewed missions.\n\nThe Human Landing System (HLS) is a spacecraft that can convey crew members from NRHO to the lunar surface, support them on the surface, and return them to NRHO. Each crewed landing needs one HLS, although some or all of the spacecraft may be reusable. Each HLS must be launched from Earth and delivered to NRHO in one or more launches. The initial commercial contract was awarded to SpaceX for two [[Starship HLS]] missions, one uncrewed and one crewed as part of Artemis 3. These two missions each require one HLS launch and multiple fueling launches, all on [[SpaceX Starship]] launchers. {{As of|2022|June}}, NASA has also exercised an option under the initial contract to commission an upgraded Starship HLS design and third demonstration lunar mission under new sustainability rules it is drafting. It intends to pursue another HLS design from outside SpaceX in parallel, for redundancy and competition.<ref name=\"NASAMarch2022Update\"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Space Review: A second chance at the Moon |url=https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4371/1 |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=www.thespacereview.com}}</ref>\n\nThe first two Gateway modules (PPE and HALO) will be delivered to NRHO in a single launch using a [[Falcon Heavy]] launcher. Originally planned to be available prior to Artemis 3, as of 2021 it is planned for availability before Artemis 4.\n\nThe Gateway will be resupplied and supported by launches of [[Dragon XL]] spacecraft launched by Falcon Heavy. Each Dragon XL will remain attached to Gateway for up to six months. the Dragon XLs will not return to Earth, but will be disposed of, probably by deliberate crashes on the lunar surface.\n\n== History ==\n{{more|Artemis HLS development history}}\n[[File:Altair-orion.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendering of the lunar module (left) and space capsule of the [[Constellation program]]]]\n[[File:Space Launch System (16525420976).jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of an early SLS launch]]\n\n===Early history===\nThe Artemis program incorporates several major components of previously canceled [[NASA]] programs and missions, including the [[Constellation program]] and the [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]].

The spacecraft consists of a Crew Module (CM) [[space capsule]] designed by [[Lockheed Martin]] and the [[European Service Module]] (ESM) manufactured by [[Airbus Defence and Space]]. Capable of supporting a crew of six beyond [[low Earth orbit]], Orion is equipped with [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]], an [[NASA Docking System|automated docking system]], and [[glass cockpit]] interfaces modeled after those used in the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. It has a single [[AJ10]] engine for primary propulsion, and others including [[reaction control system]] engines. Although designed to be compatible with other [[launch vehicle]]s, Orion is primarily intended to launch atop a [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) rocket, with a tower [[launch escape system]].\n\nOrion was originally conceived by Lockheed Martin as a proposal for the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] (CEV) to be used in NASA's [[Constellation program]]. Lockheed Martin's proposal defeated a competing proposal by [[Northrop Grumman]], and was selected by NASA in 2006 to be the CEV. Originally designed with a service module featuring a new \"Orion Main Engine\" and a pair of circular solar panels, the spacecraft was to be launched atop the [[Ares I]] rocket. Following the cancellation of the Constellation program in 2010, Orion was heavily redesigned for use in NASA's Journey to Mars initiative; later named Moon to Mars. The [[Space Launch System|SLS]] replaced the [[Ares I]] as Orion's primary launch vehicle, and the service module was replaced with a design based on the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]. A development version of Orion's CM was launched in 2014 during [[Exploration Flight Test-1]], while at least four test articles were produced. By 2022, three flight-worthy Orion crew modules have been built, with an additional one ordered, for use in the Artemis program; the first of these was due to be launched on November 30th 2020, however [[Artemis 1]] did not launch until November 16th 2022. It was reported that [[NASA]] and [[Lockheed Martin]] had found a failure with a component in one of the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion spacecraft's]] power data units but [[NASA]] later clarified that it did not expect the issue to affect the [[Artemis 1]] launch date.\n\n[[File:Gateway Space Station Module Map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|A conceptual advanced Gateway depicting what Gateway could look like in the late 2020s.]]\n\n=== Gateway ===\n{{Main|Lunar Gateway}}\n\nNASA's Gateway is an in-development [[space station|mini-space station]] in [[lunar orbit]] intended to serve as a solar-powered communication hub, science laboratory, short-term habitation module, and holding area for rovers and other robots.<ref name=\"Jackson20180911\">{{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Shanessa|title=Competition Seeks University Concepts for Gateway and Deep Space Exploration Capabilities|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/competition-seeks-university-concepts-for-gateway-and-deep-space-exploration-capabilities|website=nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|access-date=19 September 2018|date=11 September 2018|archive-date=17 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617064456/https://www.nasa.gov/feature/competition-seeks-university-concepts-for-gateway-and-deep-space-exploration-capabilities/|url-status=live}} }}</ref> While the project is led by NASA, the Gateway is meant to be developed, serviced, and utilized in collaboration with commercial and international partners: Canada ([[Canadian Space Agency]]) (CSA), Europe ([[European Space Agency]]) (ESA), and Japan ([[JAXA]]).\n\n[[File:2024 Lunar Gateway concept art, March 2020.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Phase 1 early Gateway with Power and Propulsion Element (left), Habitation and Logistics Outpost (center foreground), and cargo spacecraft (center background) depicted]]\n\nThe [[Power and Propulsion Element]] (PPE) started development at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] during the now canceled [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] (ARM).

He stated that the PPE could face delays and that moving it back to 2026 would allow for a more refined vehicle. It is also worth noting that the international partners on the Gateway would not have their modules ready until 2026.

NASA officials originally hoped the Gateway would be in position near the Moon in time for the Artemis 3 mission in 2024, allowing elements of the lunar lander to be assembled, or aggregated, at the Gateway before the arrival of astronauts on an Orion crew capsule.

The equipment delivered by Dragon XL missions could include sample collection materials, spacesuits, and other items astronauts may need on the Gateway and the surface of the Moon, according to NASA. It will launch on SpaceX's [[Falcon Heavy]] launch vehicle from pad [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A|LC-39A]] at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Florida]]. The Dragon XL is planned to stay at the Gateway for six to 12 months at a time when research payloads inside and outside the cargo vessel could be operated remotely, even when crews are not present. Its payload capacity is expected to be more than {{cvt|5000|kg}} to lunar orbit. Unlike previous Dragon variants, the spacecraft will not be reusable and will instead be built solely for transporting cargo. It will act as the United States' logistics vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|date=27 March 2020|title=Dragon XL revealed as NASA ties SpaceX to Lunar Gateway supply contract|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/03/dragon-xl-nasa-spacex-lunar-gateway-supply-contract/|publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com|access-date=2 July 2020|archive-date=28 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328020206/https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/03/dragon-xl-nasa-spacex-lunar-gateway-supply-contract/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Human Landing System ===\nThe Human Landing System (HLS) is a critical component of the Artemis mission. This system transports crew from lunar orbit (the Gateway or an Orion spacecraft) to the lunar surface, acts as a lunar habitat, and then transports the crew back to lunar orbit.\n\n====Development history====\n{{main|Artemis HLS development history}}\nNASA elected to have the HLS designed and developed by commercial vendors. NASA called for proposals, and five vendors responded. In April 2020, NASA awarded three competing design contracts, and in April 2021, NASA selected the [[Starship HLS]] to proceed to development and production.\n\nSeparately from the design and development program for the first two HLS spacecraft, NASA has multiple smaller contracts to study elements of alternative HLS designs. Eleven contracts were awarded in May 2019 and five were awarded in September 2021.\n\n==== Starship HLS ====\n{{Main|Starship HLS}}\n\nThe Starship Human Landing System (Starship HLS) was the winner selected by NASA for potential use for long-duration crewed lunar landings as part of NASA's Artemis program.<ref name=ars20210416/><ref name=\"NASAannouncementApril16\"/>\n\nStarship HLS is a variant of SpaceX's [[Starship (spacecraft)|Starship spacecraft]] <!-- leave \"spacecraft\" because, unfortunately, SpaceX uses \"Starship\" for both the spacecraft, and for the two-stage-to-orbit \"Starship system\" of both booster+spaceship --> optimized to operate on and around the Moon. In contrast to the Starship spacecraft from which it derives, Starship HLS will never re-enter an atmosphere, so it does not have a [[heat shield]] or [[flight control surface]]s. In contrast to other proposed HLS designs that used multiple stages, the entire spacecraft will land on the Moon and will then launch from the Moon. Like other Starship variants, Starship HLS has [[SpaceX Raptor|Raptor]] engines mounted at the tail as its primary propulsion system. However, when it is within \"tens of meters\" of the lunar surface during descent and ascent, it will use high-thrust meth/ox RCS thrusters located mid-body instead of the Raptors to avoid raising dust via [[plume impingement]]. A solar array located on the nose below the docking port provides electrical power. Elon Musk stated that Starship HLS would be able to deliver \"potentially up to 200 tons\" to the lunar surface.\n\nStarship HLS would be launched to Earth orbit using the SpaceX [[SpaceX Starship#Super Heavy booster|Super Heavy booster]], and would use a series of tanker spacecraft to refuel the Starship HLS vehicle in Earth orbit for lunar transit and lunar landing operations. Starship HLS would then boost itself to lunar orbit for rendezvous with Orion. In the mission concept, a NASA Orion spacecraft would carry a NASA crew to the lander, where they would depart and descend to the surface of the Moon. After lunar surface operations, Starship HLS would lift off from the lunar surface acting as a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) vehicle and return the crew to Orion.\n\n=== HERACLES lander===\n{{main|HERACLES (spacecraft)}}\n\n[[HERACLES (spacecraft)|HERACLES]] (Human-Enhanced Robotic Architecture and Capability for Lunar Exploration and Science) is a planned [[European Space Agency|ESA]]-[[JAXA]]-[[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]] space cargo transport system that will feature a robotic lunar lander called the European Large Logistic Lander (EL3),<ref name=\"PA Dec2019\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2019/12/08/helping-heracles-el3-to-survive-the-long-cold-dark-lunar-nights/|title=Helping Heracles EL3 to Survive the Long, Cold, Dark Lunar Nights|first=Doug|last=Messier|publisher=Parabolic Arc|date=8 December 2019|access-date=10 December 2019|archive-date=10 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210163508/http://www.parabolicarc.com/2019/12/08/helping-heracles-el3-to-survive-the-long-cold-dark-lunar-nights/|url-status=live}}</ref> which can be configured for different operations such as up to {{cvt|1500|kg}} of payload,<ref name=\"SR_Dec2019\"/> [[sample-return mission|sample-returns]], or prospecting [[Lunar resources|resources found on the Moon]].<ref name=HERACLES_ELLL>{{cite web|url=https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2019/11/European_Large_Logistic_Lander_approaching_Moon|title=The Heracles European Large Logistic Lander|website=esa.int|access-date=10 December 2019|archive-date=10 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210160003/https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2019/11/European_Large_Logistic_Lander_approaching_Moon|url-status=live}}</ref> ESA approved the project in November 2019.<ref name=\"SR_Dec2019\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thespacereview.com/article/3843/1|title=Funding Europe's space ambitions|first=Jeff|last=Foust|publisher=The Space Review|date=December 2019|access-date=10 December 2019|archive-date=29 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229115217/https://www.thespacereview.com/article/3843/1|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://room.eu.com/news/hera-mission-is-approved-as-esa-receives-biggest-ever-budget|title=Hera mission is approved as ESA receives biggest ever budget|first=Kerry|last=Hebden|publisher=Room|date=29 November 2019|access-date=10 December 2019|archive-date=10 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210155035/https://room.eu.com/news/hera-mission-is-approved-as-esa-receives-biggest-ever-budget|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/esa-declares-success-at-ministerial-meeting/|title=ESA declares success at ministerial meeting|date=28 November 2019|website=SpaceNews|access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref> Its first mission is envisioned for launch in the mid to late 2020s aboard an [[Ariane 6]].<ref>{{cite web|author=European Space Agency|url=https://scitechdaily.com/get-your-ticket-to-the-moon-europes-first-ever-lunar-lander/|title=Get Your Ticket to the Moon: Europe's First Ever Lunar Lander|publisher=SciTechDaily|date=29 May 2020|access-date=2 July 2020|archive-date=28 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428040542/https://scitechdaily.com/get-your-ticket-to-the-moon-europes-first-ever-lunar-lander/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"PA Dec2019\"/>\n\nThe EL3 lander will be launched directly to the Moon and will have a landing mass of approximately {{cvt|1800|kg}}.<ref name=\"HERACLES intro 2019\"/> It will be capable of transporting a Canadian robotic rover to explore, [[Lunar resources|prospect potential resources]], and load samples up to {{cvt|15|kg}} on the ascent module.<ref name=\"Hiesinger 2019\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/pdf/1327|title=HERACLES: An ESA-JAXA-CSA Joint Study on Returning to the Moon.

A ''notional'' concept of operations (i.e., a hypothetical but possible plan) would include the following: On Day 1 of the stay, astronauts touchdown on the Moon but do not conduct an EVA. Instead, they prepare for the EVA scheduled for the next day in what is referred to as \"The Road to EVA\". On Day 2, the astronauts open the hatch on the Human Landing System and embark on EVA 1 which will be six hours long. It will include collecting a contingency sample, conducting public affairs activities, deploying the experiment package, and acquiring samples. The astronauts will stay close to the landing site on this first EVA. EVA 2 begins on day 3. The astronauts characterize and collect samples from [[Far side of the Moon|permanently shadowed regions]]. Unlike the previous EVA, the astronauts will go farther from the landing site, up to {{convert|2|km|mi}}, and up and down slopes of 20\u00b0. Day 4 will not include an EVA but Day 5 will. EVA 3 may include activities such as collecting samples from an ejecta blanket. Day 6 will have the two astronauts deploy a geotechnical instrument alongside an environmental monitoring station for [[In situ resource utilization|in-situ resource utilization (ISRU)]]. Day 7 will have the final and shortest EVA; this EVA will only last one hour rather than the others' six hours in duration from egress to ingress and mostly comprises preparations for the lunar liftoff, including jettisoning hardware. Once the final EVA is concluded, the astronauts will return into the Human Landing System and the vehicle will launch from the surface and join up with Orion/Gateway.<ref>{{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20200001071|title=Exploration EVA System Concept of Operations Summary for Artemis Phase 1 Lunar Surface Mission|publisher=NASA Technical Report Server|website=ntrs.nasa.gov|access-date=18 April 2020|archive-date=28 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428040547/https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20200001071|url-status=live}}}}</ref>\n\n== Artemis Base Camp ==\n{{See also|Lunar outpost}}\n[[File:Artemis_Base_Camp.png|thumb|upright=1.2|right|A render of the Artemis Base Camp]]\nArtemis Base Camp is the prospective lunar base that was proposed to be established at the end of the 2020s.

It would support missions of up to two months and be used to study technologies to use on Mars. The idea would be to build upon this initial base site for decades through both Government and commercial programs.

NASA has developed multiple pressurized rovers including the [[Space Exploration Vehicle]] built for the [[Constellation program]] which was fabricated and tested. In the 2020 flight manifest it was referred to as the Mobile Habitat suggesting it could fill a similar role to the [[International Lunar Resources Exploration Concept|ILREC Lunar Bus]]. It would be ready for the crew to use on the surface but could also be autonomously controlled from the Gateway or other locations. Mark Kirasich, who is the acting director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems, has stated that the current plan is to partner with [[JAXA]] and [[Toyota]] to develop a closed cabin rover to support crews for up to 14 days (currently known as [[Lunar Cruiser]]). \"It's very important to our leadership at the moment to involve JAXA in a major surface element\", he said. \"...&nbsp;The Japanese, and their auto industry, have a very strong interest in rover-type things.

In regards to the SEV, Senior Lunar Scientist Clive Neal said \"Under Constellation NASA had a sophisticated rover put together, It's pretty sad if it's never going to get to the Moon\". but also said that he understands the different scopes of the Constellation Program and Artemis program and the focus on international collaboration.<ref name=\":2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-seek-ideas-for-an-artemis-lunar-rover/|title=NASA to seek ideas for an Artemis lunar rover|date=20 November 2019|website=SpaceNews|access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/desert_rats_2008.html|title=NASA - Three Days in the Desert Tests Lunar \"RV\"|website=Nasa.gov|access-date=24 January 2020|archive-date=26 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726095741/https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/desert_rats_2008.html|url-status=live}} }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Eric|date=15 July 2020|title=NASA's first lunar habitat may be an RV-like rover built by Toyota|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/nasas-first-lunar-habitat-may-be-an-rv-like-rover-built-by-toyota/|publisher=Ars Technica|access-date=16 July 2020|archive-date=15 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715235428/https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/nasas-first-lunar-habitat-may-be-an-rv-like-rover-built-by-toyota/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bullard|first=Benjamin|date=15 July 2020|title=NASA eyes closed-cabin rover \"like an RV for the Moon\" in first step toward long-term lunar presence|website=syfy.com|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/nasa-artemis-lunar-rover-like-rv-for-the-moon|access-date=16 July 2020|archive-date=12 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812034652/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/nasa-artemis-lunar-rover-like-rv-for-the-moon|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Moon rover ==\n=== Lunar light vehicle development ===\n{{Main|Lunar Terrain Vehicle}}\n[[File:NASA_Lunar_Terrain_Vehicle.png|thumb|upright=1.2|right|NASA's baseline Lunar Terrain Vehicle]]\n\nIn February 2020, NASA released two [[requests for information]] regarding both a crewed and uncrewed unpressurized surface rover.

He presented an alternative approach to a 2024 crewed lunar landing called \"[[Moon Direct]]\", a successor to his proposed [[Mars Direct]]. His vision phases out the SLS and Orion, replacing them with the [[SpaceX launch vehicles]] and [[SpaceX Dragon 2]]. It also proposes using a heavy ferry/lander that would be refueled on the lunar surface via [[in situ resource utilization]] and transfer the crew from LEO to the lunar surface. The concept bears a heavy resemblance to NASA's own [[Space Transportation System]] proposal from the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/moon-direct|title=Moon Direct \u2014 The New Atlantis|date=28 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428040537/https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/moon-direct |access-date=26 June 2022|archive-date=28 April 2021 }}</ref>\n\n[[Apollo 11]] astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] disagrees with NASA's current goals and priorities, including their plans for a lunar outpost. He also questioned the benefit of the idea to \"send a crew to an intermediate point in space, pick up a lander there and go down\". However, Aldrin expressed support for Robert Zubrin's \"Moon Direct\" concept which involves lunar landers traveling from Earth orbit to the lunar surface and back.<ref name=\"spacenews_lunar-exploration-plans\">{{cite news|last1=Foust|first1=Jeff|title=Advisory group skeptical of NASA lunar exploration plans|url=https://spacenews.com/advisory-group-skeptical-of-nasa-lunar-exploration-plans/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=16 November 2018|access-date=20 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n== House Authorization Bill of 2020 ==\nThe leadership of the House Science Committee introduced a bipartisan NASA authorization bill on 24 January 2020 that would significantly alter NASA's current plans to return humans to the Moon and rather would focus on a [[Deep Space Transport|Mars orbital mission]] in 2033. Bill H.R. 5666 would change the lunar landing date from 2024 to 2028 and put the program as a whole underneath a larger space exploration plan.
