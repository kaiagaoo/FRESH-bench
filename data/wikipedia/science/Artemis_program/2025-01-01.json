It is intended to reestablish a human presence on the Moon for the first time since the [[Apollo 17]] mission in 1972. The program's stated long-term goal is to establish a [[Moonbase|permanent base on the Moon]] to facilitate [[Human mission to Mars|human missions to Mars]].\n\nTwo principal elements of the Artemis program are derived from the now-cancelled [[Constellation program]]: the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion spacecraft]] and the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) (as a reincarnation of [[Ares V]]). Other elements of the program, such as the [[Lunar Gateway|Lunar Gateway space station]] and the [[Human Landing System]], are in development by [[List of government space agencies|government space agencies]] and [[private spaceflight]] companies, collaborations bound by the [[Artemis Accords]] and governmental contracts.\n\nThe Space Launch System, Orion spacecraft and the Human Landing System form the main [[spaceflight]] infrastructure for Artemis, and the Lunar Gateway plays a supporting role in human habitation. Supporting infrastructures for Artemis include the [[#Commercial Lunar Payload Services|Commercial Lunar Payload Services]], [[Exploration Ground Systems|development of ground infrastructures]], [[Artemis Base Camp]] on the Moon, Moon rovers, and spacesuits. Some aspects of the program have been criticized, such as the use of a [[near-rectilinear halo orbit]] and the program's sustainability.\n\nOrion's first launch on the Space Launch System was originally set in 2016, but faced numerous delays; it launched on 16 November 2022 as the [[Artemis I]] mission, with robots and mannequins aboard. {{As of|2024|12}}, the crewed [[Artemis II]] launch is expected to take place in April 2026, the [[Artemis III]] crewed lunar landing is scheduled for mid-2027, the [[Artemis IV]] docking with the Lunar Gateway is planned for late 2028, the [[Artemis V]] docking with the European Space Agency's [[European System Providing Refueling, Infrastructure and Telecommunications|ESPRIT]], Canada's Canadarm3, and NASA's [[Lunar Terrain Vehicle]] is planned for early 2030, and the Artemis VI docking which is expected to integrate the [[Crew and Science Airlock Module|Crew and Science Airlock]] with the [[Gateway space station|Lunar Gateway station]] is planned for early 2031. After Artemis VI, NASA plans yearly landings on the Moon from then on. However, the [[NASA Inspector General]] has called the schedules unrealistic.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Artemis Phase 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2.6|Planned missions of Artemis program]]\n[[File:Spaceships.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Currently operational crewed spacecraft (at least orbital class)]]\nThe Artemis program is organized around a series of SLS missions. These space missions will increase in complexity and are scheduled to occur at intervals of a year or more. NASA and its partners have planned Artemis I through Artemis V missions; later Artemis missions have also been proposed. Each SLS mission centers on the launch of an SLS launch vehicle carrying an [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion spacecraft]]. Missions after Artemis II will depend on support missions launched by other organizations and spacecraft for support functions.\n\n===SLS missions===\nArtemis I (2022) was the successful uncrewed test of the SLS and Orion, and was the first test flight for both craft.{{efn-lr|group=main|An Orion capsule was [[Exploration Flight Test-1|flown]] in 2014, but not the entire Orion spacecraft.}} The Artemis I mission placed Orion into a lunar orbit and then returned to Earth. The SLS Block 1 design uses the [[Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage]] (ICPS) second stage, which performs the trans-lunar injection burn to send Orion to lunar space. For Artemis I, Orion braked into a polar distant retrograde [[lunar orbit]] and remained for about six days before boosting back toward Earth. The Orion capsule separated from its service module, re-entered the atmosphere for [[aerobraking]], and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean under parachutes.<ref name=\"SFN20200518\">{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Stephen|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/05/18/nasa-will-likely-add-a-rendezvous-test-to-the-first-piloted-orion-space-mission/|title=NASA will likely add a rendezvous test to the first piloted Orion space mission|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=18 May 2020|access-date=19 May 2020|archive-date=8 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200708065618/https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/05/18/nasa-will-likely-add-a-rendezvous-test-to-the-first-piloted-orion-space-mission/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nArtemis II (2026) is planned to be the first crewed test flight of SLS and the Orion spacecraft.<ref name=\"spo-20240109\">{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Marcia |date=9 January 2024 |title=NASA Delays Next Artemis Missions to 2025 and 2026 |url=https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/nasa-delays-next-artemis-missions-to-2025-and-2026/ |access-date=10 January 2024 |work=SpacePolicyOnline}}</ref> The four crew members will perform extensive testing in Earth orbit, and Orion will then be boosted into a [[Circumlunar trajectory|free-return trajectory around the Moon]], which will return Orion to Earth for re-entry and splashdown.

Most of these missions are executed under NASA contracts to commercial providers.\n\nUnder the [[Commercial Lunar Payload Services]] (CLPS) program, several robotic landers will deliver scientific instruments and robotic rovers to the lunar surface after Artemis I. Additional CLPS missions are planned throughout the Artemis program to deliver payloads to the Moon base. These include habitat modules and rovers in support of crewed missions.\n\nA Human Landing System (HLS) is a spacecraft that can convey crew members from NRHO to the lunar surface, support them on the surface, and return them to NRHO. Each crewed landing needs one HLS, although some or all of the spacecraft may be reusable. Each HLS must be launched from Earth and delivered to NRHO in one or more launches. The initial commercial contract was awarded to SpaceX for two Starship HLS missions, one uncrewed and one crewed as part of Artemis III. These two missions each require one HLS launch and multiple fueling launches, all on [[SpaceX Starship]] launchers. NASA later exercised an option under the initial contract to commission an upgraded Starship HLS for Artemis IV and a separate contract to [[Blue Origin]] to develop a third crewed lunar lander, which will make its first crewed flight as part of the Artemis V mission.\n\nThe first two Gateway modules (PPE and HALO) will be delivered to NRHO in a single launch using a [[Falcon Heavy]] launcher. Originally planned to be available prior to Artemis III, as of 2021 it is planned for availability before Artemis IV.\n\nThe Gateway will be resupplied and supported by launches of [[Dragon XL]] spacecraft launched by Falcon Heavy. Each Dragon XL will remain attached to Gateway for up to six months. The Dragon XLs will not return to Earth, but will be disposed of, probably by deliberate crashes on the lunar surface.\n\n== History ==\n{{further|Artemis HLS development history}}\n[[File:Altair-orion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Artist's rendering of the lunar module (left) and space capsule of the [[Constellation program]]]]\n[[File:Space Launch System (16525420976).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Artist's impression of an SLS launch]]\n\n===Early history===\nThe Artemis program incorporates several major components of previously cancelled [[NASA]] programs and missions, including the [[Constellation program]] and the [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]].

It consists of a first-stage booster named [[SpaceX Super Heavy|Super-Heavy]] and a second-stage space vehicle which is generally named [[SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)|Starship]] and which will have several variants. A Starship HLS mission will use three variants: a tanker, a propellant depot, and the [[Starship HLS]] itself which will be designed only for lunar landings and takeoffs, and not for Earth landings. Some variants will be able to return to Earth for reuse.\n\nThe second-stage Starships are fully self-contained spacecraft, complete with their own propulsion systems. The combined Starship system using standard Starship variants for its second-stage is planned to launch crews and cargo, which may then be used to support the various developmental needs of the Artemis program, and also to support the needs of other NASA and SpaceX programs.\n\nThe SpaceX Starship is also qualified to be bid for [[Commercial Lunar Payload Services]] (CLPS) launches, and in 2021 was the winning NASA bid for a crewed lunar landing.<ref name=\"spacex_hls\">[https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/as-artemis-moves-forward-nasa-picks-spacex-to-land-next-americans-on-moon As Artemis Moves Forward, NASA Picks SpaceX to Land Next Americans on Moon] NASA.

The spacecraft consists of a Crew Module (CM) [[space capsule]] designed by [[Lockheed Martin]] and the [[European Service Module]] (ESM) manufactured by [[Airbus Defence and Space]]. Capable of supporting a crew of six beyond [[low Earth orbit]], Orion is equipped with [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]], an [[NASA Docking System|automated docking system]], and [[glass cockpit]] interfaces modeled after those used in the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. It has a single [[AJ10]] engine for primary propulsion, and others including [[reaction control system]] engines. Although designed to be compatible with other [[launch vehicle]]s, Orion is primarily intended to launch atop a [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) rocket, with a tower [[launch escape system]].\n\nOrion was originally conceived by Lockheed Martin as a proposal for the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] (CEV) to be used in NASA's [[Constellation program]]. Following the cancellation of the Constellation program in 2010, Orion was heavily redesigned for use in NASA's Journey to Mars initiative; later named Moon to Mars. The [[Space Launch System|SLS]] replaced the [[Ares I]] as Orion's primary launch vehicle, and the service module was replaced with a design based on the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]. A development version of Orion's CM was launched in 2014 during [[Exploration Flight Test-1]], while at least four test articles were produced. By 2022, three flight-worthy Orion crew modules have been built, with an additional one ordered, for use in the Artemis program; the first of these was due to be launched on 30 November 2020, however [[Artemis I]] did not launch until 16 November 2022.\n\n[[File:Gateway Space Station Module Map.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|right|A conceptual advanced Gateway depicting what Gateway could look like in the late 2020s.]]\n\n=== Dragon XL ===\n{{Excerpt|SpaceX Dragon#Dragon XL}}\n\n=== Human Landing System (HLS)===\nThe Human Landing System (HLS) is a critical component of the Artemis mission. This system transports crew from lunar orbit (the Gateway or an Orion spacecraft) to the lunar surface, acts as a lunar habitat, and then transports the crew back to lunar orbit. In 2021 SpaceX's [[Starship HLS]] program was awarded the winning NASA bid for the production of a crewed lunar landing vehicle.<ref name=\"spacex_hls\"/> In May 2023, [[Blue Origin]] was selected as the second provider for lunar lander services.<ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Shea |first=Claire |date=2023-05-19 |title=NASA Selects Blue Origin as Second Artemis Lunar Lander Provider |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-blue-origin-as-second-artemis-lunar-lander-provider |access-date=2023-05-19 |website=NASA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Roulette |first=Joey |date=2023-05-19 |title=Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin wins NASA contract to build astronaut lunar lander |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/nasa-name-second-company-build-astronaut-lunar-lander-2023-05-19/ |access-date=2023-05-19}}</ref>\n\n====Early developmental history of the HLS vehicle====\n{{main|Artemis HLS development history}}\nBidding for NASA's HLS lunar landing vehicle began in 2019. At that time, NASA elected to have the HLS designed and developed by commercial vendors. Eleven competing contracts were initially awarded in May 2019. In April 2020, NASA awarded three competing design contracts, and in April 2021, NASA selected the [[Starship HLS]] to proceed to development and production.\n\nSeparate from its early design and development program for its first HLS spacecraft, NASA retains multiple smaller contracts to study various elements of alternative HLS designs.\n\n==== Starship HLS ====\n{{Main|Starship HLS}}\n\nThe Starship Human Landing System (Starship HLS) was the winner selected by NASA for potential use for long-duration crewed lunar landings as part of NASA's Artemis program.<ref name=ars20210416/><ref name=\"NASAannouncementApril16\"/>\n\nStarship HLS is a variant of SpaceX's [[SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)|Starship spacecraft]] <!-- leave \"spacecraft\" because, unfortunately, SpaceX uses \"Starship\" for both the spacecraft, and for the two-stage-to-orbit \"Starship system\" of both booster+spaceship --> optimized to operate on and around the Moon. In contrast to the Starship spacecraft from which it derives, Starship HLS will never re-enter an atmosphere, so it does not have a [[heat shield]] or [[flight control surface]]s. In contrast to other proposed HLS designs that used multiple stages, the entire spacecraft will land on the Moon and will then launch from the Moon. Like other Starship variants, Starship HLS has [[SpaceX Raptor|Raptor]] engines mounted at the tail as its primary propulsion system. However, when it is within \"tens of meters\" of the lunar surface during descent and ascent, it will use high-thrust methane/oxygen RCS thrusters located mid-body instead of the Raptors to avoid raising dust via [[plume impingement]]. A solar array located on the nose below the docking port provides electrical power. Elon Musk stated that Starship HLS would be able to deliver \"potentially up to 200 tons\" to the lunar surface.\n\nStarship HLS would be launched to Earth orbit using the SpaceX [[SpaceX Starship#Super Heavy booster|Super Heavy booster]], and would use a series of tanker spacecraft to refuel the Starship HLS vehicle in Earth orbit for lunar transit and lunar landing operations, a capability referred to as [[Orbital propellant depot|orbital refueling]]. Starship HLS would then boost itself to lunar orbit for rendezvous with Orion. In the mission concept, a NASA Orion spacecraft would carry a NASA crew to the lander, where they would depart and descend to the surface of the Moon. After lunar surface operations, Starship HLS would lift off from the lunar surface acting as a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) vehicle and return the crew to Orion.\n\n==== Blue Origin HLS ====\n{{Main|Blue Moon (spacecraft)}}\nOn 19 May 2023, NASA announced an additional contract to Blue Origin to develop a second crewed lunar lander, which will make its first crewed flight as part of the [[Artemis V]] mission. Blue Moon is smaller than the SpaceX HLS lander, having only 20 tons of payload capacity. The lander is fueled with a combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants.<ref name=\"BO HLS\">{{Cite web |last=O'Shea |first=Claire |date=2023-05-19 |title=NASA Selects Blue Origin as Second Artemis Lunar Lander Provider |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-blue-origin-as-second-artemis-lunar-lander-provider |access-date=2023-05-20 |website=NASA}}</ref>\n\n=== Lunar Gateway ===\n{{Main|Lunar Gateway}}\n\nNASA's Gateway is an in-development [[space station|mini-space station]] in [[lunar orbit]] intended to serve as a solar-powered communication hub, science laboratory, short-term habitation module, and holding area for rovers and other robots.<ref name=\"Jackson20180911\">{{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Shanessa|title=Competition Seeks University Concepts for Gateway and Deep Space Exploration Capabilities|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/competition-seeks-university-concepts-for-gateway-and-deep-space-exploration-capabilities|website=nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|access-date=19 September 2018|date=11 September 2018|archive-date=17 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617064456/https://www.nasa.gov/feature/competition-seeks-university-concepts-for-gateway-and-deep-space-exploration-capabilities/|url-status=live}} }}</ref> While the project is led by NASA, the Gateway is meant to be developed, serviced, and used in collaboration with commercial and international partners: Canada ([[Canadian Space Agency]]) (CSA), Europe ([[European Space Agency]]) (ESA), and Japan ([[JAXA]]).\n\n[[File:2024 Lunar Gateway concept art, March 2020.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Phase 1 early Gateway with Power and Propulsion Element (left), Habitation and Logistics Outpost (center foreground), and cargo spacecraft (center background) depicted]]\n\nThe [[Power and Propulsion Element]] (PPE) started development at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] during the now canceled [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] (ARM).

A ''notional'' concept of operations, i.e., a hypothetical but possible plan, would include the following: On Day 1 of the stay, astronauts touchdown on the Moon but do not conduct an EVA. Instead, they prepare for the EVA scheduled for the next day, in what is referred to as \"The Road to EVA\".<ref name=\"ntrs.nasa.gov\">{{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20200001071|title=Exploration EVA System Concept of Operations Summary for Artemis Phase 1 Lunar Surface Mission|publisher=NASA Technical Report Server|website=ntrs.nasa.gov|access-date=18 April 2020|archive-date=28 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428040547/https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20200001071|url-status=live}}}}</ref>\n\nOn Day 2, the astronauts open the hatch on the Human Landing System and embark on EVA 1, which will be six hours long. It will include collecting a contingency sample, conducting public affairs activities, deploying the experiment package, and acquiring samples. The astronauts will stay close to the landing site on this first EVA. EVA 2 begins on day 3. The astronauts characterize and collect samples from [[Permanently shadowed crater|permanently shadowed regions]]. Unlike the previous EVA, the astronauts will go farther from the landing site, up to {{convert|2|km|mi}}, and up and down slopes of 20\u00b0.<ref name=\"ntrs.nasa.gov\"/>\n\nDay 4 will not include an EVA, but Day 5 will. EVA 3 may include activities such as collecting samples from an ejecta blanket. Day 6 will have the two astronauts deploy a geotechnical instrument alongside an environmental monitoring station for [[In situ resource utilization|in-situ resource utilization (ISRU)]]. Day 7 will have the final and shortest EVA. This EVA will last one hour, rather than the others' six hours in duration from egress to ingress, and mostly comprises preparations for the lunar ascent, including jettisoning hardware. Once the final EVA is concluded, the astronauts will return to the Human Landing System and the vehicle will launch from the surface and join up with Orion/Gateway.<ref name=\"ntrs.nasa.gov\"/>\n\n==== Pressurized rover (\"Mobile Habitat\") ====\n{{Main|Lunar Cruiser}}\n[[File:NASA_Habitable_Mobility_Platform.png|thumb|upright=1.4|right|NASA Habitable Mobility Platform based on the past Constellation [[Space Exploration Vehicle]]]]\nThe Pressurized Rover (PR) is a large, pressurized module used to enable crewed operation across large distances and live for multiple days. NASA had developed multiple pressurized rovers including what was formerly called the [[Space Exploration Vehicle]] (SEV). This rover was built for the [[Constellation program]] and was fabricated and then tested. In the 2020 flight manifest it was later referred to as the \"Mobile Habitat\" suggesting it could fill a similar role to the [[International Lunar Resources Exploration Concept|ILREC Lunar Bus]]. It would be ready for the crew to use on the surface but could also be autonomously controlled from the Gateway or other locations.\n\nMark Kirasich, who is the acting director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems, has stated that the current plan is to partner with [[JAXA]] and [[Toyota]] to develop a closed cabin rover to support crews for up to 14 days (currently known as [[Lunar Cruiser]]). \"It's very important to our leadership at the moment to involve JAXA in a major surface element\", he said. \"...&nbsp;The Japanese, and their auto industry, have a very strong interest in rover-type things. So, there was an idea to\u2014even though we have done a lot of work\u2014to let the Japanese lead development of a pressurized rover. So right now, that's the direction we're heading in\".\n\nIn regard to the PR, senior-lunar-scientist Clive Neal said \"Under Constellation, NASA had a sophisticated rover put together. It's pretty sad if it's never going to get to the Moon\". However Neal also said that he understands the different mission objectives between the Constellation Program and those of the Artemis Program, and the need of the Artemis Program to focus more on international collaboration.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-seek-ideas-for-an-artemis-lunar-rover/|title=NASA to seek ideas for an Artemis lunar rover|date=20 November 2019|website=SpaceNews|access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/desert_rats_2008.html|title=NASA - Three Days in the Desert Tests Lunar \"RV\"|website=Nasa.gov|access-date=24 January 2020|archive-date=26 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726095741/https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/desert_rats_2008.html|url-status=live}} }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Eric|date=15 July 2020|title=NASA's first lunar habitat may be an RV-like rover built by Toyota|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/nasas-first-lunar-habitat-may-be-an-rv-like-rover-built-by-toyota/|publisher=Ars Technica|access-date=16 July 2020|archive-date=15 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715235428/https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/nasas-first-lunar-habitat-may-be-an-rv-like-rover-built-by-toyota/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bullard|first=Benjamin|date=15 July 2020|title=NASA eyes closed-cabin rover \"like an RV for the Moon\" in first step toward long-term lunar presence|website=syfy.com|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/nasa-artemis-lunar-rover-like-rv-for-the-moon|access-date=16 July 2020|archive-date=12 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812034652/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/nasa-artemis-lunar-rover-like-rv-for-the-moon|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 April 2024, it was announced that JAXA and NASA had signed an agreement stipulating that Japan would join the pressurized rover collaboration venture and would design, develop, and operate a rover for crewed and uncrewed exploration of the Moon.

He presented an alternative approach to a 2024 crewed lunar landing called \"Moon Direct\", a successor to his proposed [[Mars Direct]]. His vision phases out the SLS and Orion, replacing them with the [[SpaceX launch vehicles]] and [[SpaceX Dragon 2]]. It proposes using a heavy ferry/lander that would be refueled on the lunar surface via [[in situ resource utilization]] and transfer the crew from LEO to the lunar surface. The concept bears a heavy resemblance to NASA's own [[Space Transportation System]] proposal from the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 April 2021 |title=Moon Direct \u2013 The New Atlantis |url=https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/moon-direct |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428040537/https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/moon-direct |archive-date=28 April 2021 |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Apollo 11]] astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] disagrees with NASA's current goals and priorities, including their plans for a lunar outpost. He questioned the benefit of the idea to \"send a crew to an intermediate point in space, pick up a lander there and go down\". However, Aldrin expressed support for Robert Zubrin's \"Moon Direct\" concept which involves lunar landers traveling from Earth orbit to the lunar surface and back.<ref name=\"spacenews_lunar-exploration-plans\">{{cite news|last1=Foust|first1=Jeff|title=Advisory group skeptical of NASA lunar exploration plans|url=https://spacenews.com/advisory-group-skeptical-of-nasa-lunar-exploration-plans/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=16 November 2018|access-date=20 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe program attracted criticism for the fact that at least 15 launches will be required to refuel HLS in orbit per crewed mission.<ref>{{Cite web |title=At Least 15 Starship Launches Needed to Execute Artemis III Lunar Landing |url=https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/at-least-15-starship-launches-to-execute-artemis-iii-lunar-landing/ |access-date=2023-12-30 |language=en-US}}</ref> In 2024, SpaceX's Jennifer Jensen stated on a call that Starship HLS will require ten launches.<ref>{{Cite tweet |number=1744807740021633382 |user=jeff_foust |title=Best part of the just-completed briefing: question about how many refueling launches will be needed for Starship HLS missions.
