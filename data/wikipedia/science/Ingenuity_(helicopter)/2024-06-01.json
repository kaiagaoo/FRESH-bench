''Ingenuity'' made its first flight on April 19, 2021, demonstrating that flight is possible in the extremely thin [[atmosphere of Mars]], and becoming the first aircraft to conduct a powered and controlled extra-terrestrial flight. It was designed by NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) in collaboration with [[AeroVironment]], NASA's [[Ames Research Center]] and [[Langley Research Center]] with some components supplied by [[Lockheed Martin Space]], [[Qualcomm]], and [[Rocket Lab|SolAero]].\n\n''Ingenuity'' was delivered to Mars on February 18, 2021, attached to the underside of the [[Perseverance (rover)|''Perseverance'' rover]], which landed at [[Octavia E. Butler Landing]] near the western rim of the {{cvt|28|mi|km|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}} [[Jezero (crater)|Jezero]] crater. Because radio signals take between five and 20 minutes to travel between Earth and Mars, depending on the planets' positions, it could not be controlled directly in real time but flew autonomously to execute flight plans designed and sent to it by JPL.\n\nOriginally intended to make only five flights, ''Ingenuity'' completed [[List of Ingenuity flights|72 flights]] in nearly three years. The five planned flights were part of a 30-[[Mars sol|sol]] technology demonstration intended to prove its [[airworthiness]] with flights of up to 90 seconds at altitudes ranging from {{cvt|3|-|5|m|0}}. Following this demonstration, JPL designed a series of operational flights to explore how aerial scouts could help [[exploration of Mars|explore Mars]] and other worlds. In this operational role, ''Ingenuity'' scouted areas of interest for the ''Perseverance'' rover, improved navigational techniques, and explored the limits of its [[flight envelope]]. ''Ingenuity's'' performance and resilience in the harsh Martian environment greatly exceeded expectations, allowing it to perform far more flights than were initially planned. On January 18, 2024, ''Ingenuity's'' rotor blades were damaged while landing on its 72nd flight, permanently grounding the helicopter. NASA announced the end of its mission one week later. ''Ingenuity'' had flown for a total of two hours, eight minutes and 48 seconds over {{age in days|19 Apr 2021|18 Jan 2024}} days, covering more than {{Convert|17|km}}.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Concept ===\n[[File:22372 PIA23159-16 Mars Helicopter Prototype.jpg|thumb|Prototype Mars helicopter, which first flew in a pressure chamber simulating the Martian atmosphere on May 31, 2016]]\n\nThe development of the project that would eventually become ''Ingenuity'' started in 2012 when JPL director [[Charles Elachi]] visited the lab's Autonomous Systems Division, which had done relevant concept work. By January 2015, NASA agreed to fund the development of a full-size model, which came to be known as the \"risk reduction\" vehicle.<ref name=\"Lerner\" />\nNASA's JPL and [[AeroVironment]] published the conceptual design in 2014 for a scout helicopter to accompany a rover.<ref name=\"Witold2018\" /><ref name=\"Balaram2014\" /><ref name=\"Pipenberg2019\" /> By mid-2016, $15&nbsp;million was being requested to continue development of the helicopter.<ref name=\"ARS_Technica_2026_05_24\" />\n\nBy December 2017, engineering models of the vehicle had been tested in a simulated [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]].<ref name=\"Balaram2018\" /><ref name=\"Aung May2018\" /> Models were undergoing testing in the [[Arctic]], but its inclusion in the mission had not yet been approved or funded.<ref name=\"All_About_Circuits_2017_11_29\" />\n\n=== Mission integration ===\nWhen the ''Mars 2020'' program was approved in July 2014,<ref name=\"NASA_2015_04_15\" /> a helicopter flight demonstration was neither included nor budgeted.<ref name=\"TheVerge_2018_05_11\" />\n\nThe [[United States federal budget]], announced in March 2018, provided $23&nbsp;million for the helicopter for one year,<ref name=\"SpaceNews_2018_02_23\" /><ref name=\"SpaceflightNow_2018_03_15\" /> and it was announced on May 11, 2018, that the helicopter could be developed and tested in time to be included in the [[Mars 2020]] mission.<ref name=\"NASA-20180511b\" /> The helicopter underwent extensive [[Flight dynamics|flight-dynamics]] and environment testing,<ref name=\"Balaram2018\" /><ref name=\"NASA-20190328\" /> and was mounted on the underside of the ''Perseverance'' rover in August 2019.<ref name=\"Integrated\">{{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|}}</ref> NASA spent about $80&nbsp;million to build ''Ingenuity'' and about $5&nbsp;million to operate the helicopter.<ref name=\"PK2020\" />\n\nIn 2019, preliminary designs of ''Ingenuity'' were tested on Earth in simulated [[Atmosphere of Mars|Mars atmospheric]] and [[gravity]] conditions. For [[flight test]]ing, a large [[vacuum chamber]] was used to simulate the very low pressure of the [[atmosphere of Mars]] \u2013 filled with [[carbon dioxide]] to about 0.60% (about {{Frac|160}}) of standard atmospheric pressure at sea level on Earth \u2013 which is roughly equivalent to a helicopter flying at {{cvt|34000|m}} altitude in the [[atmosphere of Earth]]. In order to simulate the much-reduced gravity field of Mars (38% of Earth's), 62% of Earth's gravity was offset by a line pulling upwards during flight tests.<ref name=\"veritasium20190810\" /> A \"wind-wall\" consisting of almost 900 [[computer fan]]s was used to provide wind in the chamber.{{sfn|Status 289}}<ref name=\"PreflightBriefing\" />{{rp|1:08:05\u20131:08:40}}\n\nIn April 2020, the vehicle was named ''Ingenuity'' by Vaneeza Rupani, a girl in the 11th grade at [[Tuscaloosa County High School]] in [[Northport, Alabama]], who submitted an essay into NASA's \"Name the Rover\" contest.<ref name=\"NASA-20200429a\" /><ref name=\"NASA-20200429b\" /> Known in planning stages as the Mars Helicopter Scout,<ref name=\"UASVision_2016_09_06\" /> or simply the Mars Helicopter,<ref name=\"NASA_2020_03_22\" /> the nickname '''''Ginny''''' later entered use in parallel to the parent rover ''Perseverance'' being affectionately referred to as ''Percy''.<ref name=\"NASA_APOD_2021_03_02\" /> Its full-scale engineering model for testing on Earth was named '''Earth Copter''' and, unofficially, '''Terry'''.<ref name=\"CBS_2022_09_07\" />\n\n''Ingenuity'' was designed to be a [[technology demonstrator]] by [[JPL]] to assess whether such a vehicle could fly safely.

Up until the end of the 2010s, several NASA leaders, scientists and JPL employees argued against integrating a helicopter into the mission. For three years, the future ''Ingenuity'' was developed outside the [[Mars 2020]] project and its budget.<ref name=\"SpaceNews_20180504\" /><ref name=\"Spectrum_2021_12_08\" /> And although NASA management accepted assurances in the spring of 2018 that the addition of a helicopter would not harm the goals of the expedition, Mars 2020 chief scientist, Kenneth Farley, stated \"I have personally been opposed to it because we are working very hard for efficiencies and spending 30 days working on a technology demonstration does not further those goals directly from the science point of view\".<ref name=\"SpaceNews_2022_10_17\" /> Farley was convinced that the helicopter was a distraction from the priority scientific tasks, unacceptable even for a short time.<ref name=\"SpaceNews_2022_10_17\" />\n\n[[File:Perseverance Distance Graph.svg|thumb|Comparison of total distance traveled by ''Ingenuity'' and ''Perseverance''{{efn|name=note|Flights 1, 2 and 14 are not seen because they include little, if any, horizontal displacement.}}]]\n\nThe skepticism on the part of NASA leadership was not unfounded. Scientists, engineers and managers proceeded from a pragmatic comparison of the benefits of additional aerial reconnaissance with the costs that inevitably fall on the schedule for the rover to complete all the tasks assigned to it. During a live-stream from NASA, MiMi Aung, the Ingenuity Project Manager, and [[Jennifer Harris Trosper|Jennifer Trosper]] discussed the value of Ingenuity. Trosper argued that the rover would outpace the helicopter due to its auto-navigation capability, thus negating one of central arguments for the value to the mission of the helicopter. During the operations on Mars, Trosper was shown to be correct when, in the spring of 2022, at the beginning of Sol 400 the helicopter fell behind the rover.\n\nAt the end of the \"test window\", NASA extended support for ''Ingenuity'' for another 30 sols, limiting the frequency of departures to one flight every few weeks.\n\nOn 14 June 2021, the Director of the Mars Exploration program, E. Janson, and the Principal Mars Explorer, M. Meyer, directly addressed all the staff of the Mars 2020 project. During this address they cautioned the staff to keep their Ingenuity enthusiasm in check, and concentrate on collecting samples\". On the same date, in their report to the ''Planetary Advisory Committee'' (PAC), the helicopter was mentioned only in the past tense, e.g. \"...placed Ingenuity and completed the technology demonstration phase...\".<ref name=\"Meyer_2021_06_14\" />\nDespite this early pessimism, Ingenuity has since proved to be more than capable of keeping up with Perseverance, actually staying ahead of the rover for the majority of the traverse up the Jezero delta.{{sfn|Status 450}}\n\nInsufficient solar energy during the Martian winter was the main driver of poor operational performance in the latter half of 2022.{{sfn|Status 441}}\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Mechanical design ===\n[[File:Anatomy of the Mars Helicopter.png|thumb|The main components of ''Ingenuity''|upright=1.7]]\n\n''Ingenuity'' consists of a rectangular fuselage measuring {{Convert|136|x|195|x|163|mm|abbr=on}} suspended below a pair of [[coaxial rotors|coaxial counter-rotating rotors]] measuring {{cvt|1.21|m|ft|0}} in diameter.<ref name=\"landing press kit\" /><ref name=\"Aung May2018\" /><ref name=\"NASA_2020_03_22\" /> This assembly is supported by four landing legs of {{cvt|384|mm}} each.<ref name=\"landing press kit\" /> It also carries a [[Solar cell|solar array]] mounted above the rotors to recharge its batteries.

All sensors are commercial off-the-shelf units.\n\n[[File:Electronic Core Module of NASA\u2019s Ingenuity helicopter.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Structural design of internal hardware of ''Ingenuity'']]\nThe ''Upper Sensor Assembly,'' with associated vibration isolation elements, is mounted on the mast close to the vehicle's center-of-mass to minimize the effects of angular rates and accelerations. It consists of a cellphone-grade Bosch BMI-160 [[Inertial measurement unit]] (''IMU'') and an [[inclinometer]] ([[Murata Manufacturing|Murata]] SCA100T-D02); the inclinometer is used to calibrate the IMU while on the ground prior to flight.

The RTE camera consists of the Sony IMX214, a [[rolling shutter]], 4208 \u00d7 3120-pixel resolution color sensor with a built-in Bayer color filter array and fitted to an O-film optics module. The NAV camera consists of an Omnivision OV7251, a 640 \u00d7 480 black and white global shutter sensor, mounted to a Sunny optics module.<ref name=\"Balaram2018\" />\n\nUnlike ''Perseverance'', ''Ingenuity'' does not have a special stereo camera for taking twin photos for [[Anaglyph 3D|3D pictures]] simultaneously. However, the helicopter can make such images by taking duplicate color photos of the same terrain while hovering in slightly offset positions, as in flight 11, or by taking an offset picture on the return leg of a roundtrip flight, as in flight 12.<ref name=\"SciTechDaily_2021_08_26\" />\n\n[[File:Combination of two images, one each from Ingenuity's Navigation Camera and colour camera (RTE).jpg|thumb|Combination of two images, one each from ''Ingenuity''{{'}}s Navigation Camera and color camera (RTE), taken while ''Ingenuity'' was on the ground]]\n\nWhile the RTE color camera is not necessary for flights (as in flights 7 and 8{{sfn|Status 308}}), the NAV camera operates continuously throughout each flight, with the captured images used for [[visual odometry]] to determine the aircraft's position and motion during flight. Due to limitations on the transmission rate between the aircraft, the rover, and Earth, only a limited number of images can be saved from each flight.

JPL managers said the photo procedure took an \"enormous\" amount of time, slowing the project's main mission of looking for signs of ancient life.<ref name=\"Space_2021_06_10\" />\n\nOn May 7, ''Ingenuity'' flew to a new landing site.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Location Map for Perseverance Rover \u2013 NASA |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/ |access-date=2023-09-26 |website=mars.nasa.gov |archive-date=12 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190612114112/https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAfter 12 flights by September 2021, the mission was extended indefinitely.<ref name=\"ScienceAlert_2021_09_06\" /> After 21 flights by March 2022, NASA said it would continue flying ''Ingenuity'' every two to three weeks<ref name=\"ScienceAlert_2021_09_06\" /> until at least the coming September. The area of the helicopter's next goal was more rugged than the relatively flat terrain it flew over in its first year of operation. The ancient fan-shaped river delta has jagged cliffs, angled surfaces, and projecting boulders. ''Ingenuity'' helped the mission team decide which route ''Perseverance'' should take to the top of the delta and aided it in analyzing potential science targets. Software updates eliminated the helicopter's 50-foot altitude limit, allowed it to change speed in flight, and improved its understanding of terrain texture below it. NASA associate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen noted that less than a year previously, \"we didn't even know if powered, controlled flight of an aircraft at Mars was possible.\" He said that the advancement in understanding what the aircraft can do is \"one of the most historic in the annals of air and space exploration.\"<ref name=NASA_2022_3_15/>\n\nThe helicopter's longer-than-expected flying career lasted into a seasonal change on Mars. This lowered the atmospheric density, which required higher rotor speed for flight: probably 2700 rpm, according to the flight team's calculations. JPL said this might cause dangerous vibration, power consumption, and aerodynamic drag if the blade tips approach the speed of sound.{{sfn|Status 334}} So the flight team commanded ''Ingenuity'' to test the rotor at 2800 rpm while remaining on the ground.\n\nIn mid-September, the flight team began preparing for the Martian winter and [[solar conjunction]], when Mars moves behind the Sun, blocking communications with Earth and forcing the rover and helicopter to halt operations. When the shutdown began in mid-October 2021<ref name=\"NASA_2021_04_30_New_Phase\" /><ref name=\"NASA_2021_08_18\" /> the helicopter remained stationary {{convert|575|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|order=flip}} from ''Perseverance'' and communicated its status weekly to the rover for health checks.<ref name=\"NASA_2021_09_28\" /> JPL intended to continue flying ''Ingenuity'' since it survived solar conjunction.<ref name=\"BusinessInsider_2021_08_30\" /><ref name=\"NDTV_2021_09_05\" /> NASA leaders said that extending the mission would increase the project's expenses, but that they believed the cost to be worthwhile for the information learned.<ref name=\"UPI_2021_12_09\" />\n\nThe launch time of each flight was influenced by the temperature of the batteries, which needed to warm up after the night. During Martian summer lower air density imposed a higher load on the motors, so flights were shifted from noon ([[Timekeeping on Mars#Lander mission clocks|LMST]] 12:30) to morning (LMST 9:30) and limited to 130&nbsp;seconds to not overheat the motors.{{sfn|Status 373}}\n\nOn May 3 and 4, 2022, for the first time in the mission, the helicopter unexpectedly failed to communicate with the rover, following the 28th flight on April 29.{{sfn|Status 382}} JPL determined that ''Ingenuity''{{'}}s rechargeable batteries suffered a power drop or insufficient battery state-of-charge while going into the night, most likely because of a seasonal increase in atmospheric dust reducing sunshine on its solar panel and due to lower temperatures as winter approached. When the battery pack's state of charge dropped below a lower limit, the helicopter's [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA) powered down, resetting the mission clock, which lost sync with the base station on the rover. Contact was re-established on May 5. Controllers decided to turn off the helicopter's heaters at night to conserve power, accepting the risk of exposing components to nighttime's extreme cold.{{sfn|Status 379}}\nThis daily state-of-charge deficit is likely to persist for the duration of Martian winter (at least until September/October).{{sfn|Status 382}}\n\nIn a June 6, 2022, update, JPL reported ''Ingenuity''{{'}}s inclination sensor had stopped working. Its purpose was to determine the helicopter's orientation at the start of each flight. Mission controllers developed a workaround using the craft's inertial measurement unit (IMU) to provide equivalent data to the onboard navigation computer.{{sfn|Status 385}}\n\nIn January 2023, the helicopter began to have enough solar power to avoid overnight brownouts and FPGA resets due to the start of Martian spring.{{sfn|Status 441}} This meant the helicopter was able to fly more frequently and over longer distances.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}\n\nIn March 2023, the helicopter made frequent flights to deal with limited radio range in the rough terrain of the Jezero delta. In the narrow canyons of the river delta, the helicopter needed to stay ahead of the rover, rather than entering a \"keep out\" zone and passing it, which JPL considered potentially hazardous.{{sfn|Status 450}}\n\nThree times, mission controllers lost contact with ''Ingenuity'' after a flight, when the helicopter was not in the line of sight with ''Perseverance'', preventing radio communication with the rover, which relays flight data between the helicopter and Earth. After the 49th flight on April 2, 2023, JPL lost contact with ''Ingenuity'' for six days, until ''Perseverance'' drove to a spot where communication was re-established.<ref name=\"WP-20230602\">{{cite news |last=Wu |first=Daniel |title=NASA's Mars helicopter is somehow still flying \u2014 and playing hide-and-seek \u2013 Scientists thought Ingenuity would fail years ago.
