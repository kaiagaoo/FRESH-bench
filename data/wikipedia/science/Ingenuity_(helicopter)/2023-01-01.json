The Sony IMX 214 with 4208 x 3120 pixel resolution is a color camera with a [[Rolling shutter|global shutter]] to make terrain images for return to Earth (RTE). The Omnivision OV7251 (640 \u00d7 480)  [[VGA]] is the downward-looking black and white rolling shutter navigation camera (NAV), which supplies the onboard computer of the helicopter with the raw data essential for flight control.<ref name=\"Balaram 2018\" />\n\nWhile the RTE color camera is not necessary for flight and may be switched off (as in flights 7 and 8{{sfn|Status 308}}), the NAV camera works throughout each flight, catching the first frame before takeoff and the last frame after landing. Its frame rate is synchronized with blade rotation to ease online image processing.\n\nDuring flight, all NAV frames must be carefully stored in the onboard helicopter computer, with each frame assigned the unique timestamp of its creation. Loss of a single NAV image timestamp was an anomaly that caused the helicopter to move erratically during flight 6.{{sfn|Status 305}}\n\n[[File:Antenna for Ingenuity and Sky Camera on Perseverance.png|thumb|right|The [[monopole antenna]] of the base station is mounted on a bracket in the right rear part of the rover]]\n\nThe longer a flight lasts, the more NAV photos must be stored. Each new record flight duration automatically means a record number of images taken by the NAV camera. The frequency and timing of the camera's operations are predetermined not for the sake of records, but due to the technical necessity. A huge number of NAV files does not overload the local storage of the helicopter. Less than 200 NAV files are uploaded to NASA storage after each flight (starting with the eighth flight), and the total volume is only about five megabytes.<!--JPEG compresses the raw 300-Kb of 640\u00d7480 256-color bitmap from 10 to 15 times (up to 20-35 Kb).--><ref name=\"NavStats-sol174\" /> The limitations are imposed by weakness of local telecommunications: when landed, the helicopter relays data to the rover in a slow mode of 20 kbit/s.<ref name=\"Balaram 2018\" /> Another significant limitation is caused by the location of the antenna on the side of the rover. If turned wrong side to the helicopter, the rover body may impede signal reception.\n\nThe navigation camera has been programmed to deactivate whenever the rotorcraft is within {{cvt|1|m|ft}} of the surface.

Without pictures from the rover, the flight team relied more heavily on photos taken by the helicopter NAV camera to confirm ''Ingenuity's'' location.

This update provides ''Ingenuity'' two major new capabilities: hazard avoidance when landing and the use of digital elevation maps to help navigate.\n\n''Ingenuity'' was developed as a technology demonstration and designed to operate on Mars in flat, smooth terrain like that at [[Wright Brothers Field]]. As ''Ingenuity'' moved on to exploring [[Jezero (crater)|Jezero Crater]] alongside the ''Perseverance'' rover, it traveled through more challenging terrain than the team had ever anticipated.\n\nIn prior flights, ''Ingenuity''\u2019s pilots have needed to find airfields free of any rocks or other obstacles that could potentially damage the vehicle when landing. Jezero Crater is a rocky place, so safe airfields have been tough to find. Using ''Ingenuity''\u2019s downward-facing navigation camera, this software update adds hazard avoidance on landing to work like [[Hazard Avoidance Cameras]] on the rover. While in flight, ''Ingenuity'' will identify the safest visible landing site. When preparing to land, ''Ingenuity'' will then divert over to this selected site. This capability allows ''Ingenuity'' to safely land in rockier terrain than before, providing pilots with many more potential landing sites.\n\n''Ingenuity''\u2019s navigation software was designed to assume the vehicle was flying over flat terrain. When the helicopter is flying over terrain like hills, this flat-ground assumption causes ''Ingenuity''\u2019s navigation software to think the vehicle is veering, causing it to start actually veering in an attempt to counter the error. Over long flights, navigation errors caused by rough terrain must be accounted for, requiring the team to select large airfields. This new software update corrects this flat-ground assumption by using digital elevation maps of Jezero Crater to help the navigation software distinguish between changes in terrain and vehicle movement. This increases ''Ingenuity''\u2019s accuracy, allowing the pilots to target smaller airfields going forward.<ref>{{Cite web |last=mars.nasa.gov |title=Flight 34 Was Short But Significant - NASA |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/420/flight-34-was-short-but-significant/ |access-date=2022-11-24 |website=mars.nasa.gov |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n{{Main|List of Ingenuity flights{{!}}List of ''Ingenuity'' flights}}\n[[File:Perseverance Distance Graph.svg|thumb|Comparison of total distance traveled between ''Ingenuity'' and ''Perseverance''.{{efn|name=note|Flights 1, 2 and 14 are not seen because they include little, if any, horizontal movement.}}|left]]\n[[File:Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover Traverse Path And Ingenuity Helicopter Flight Path.png|thumb|388x388px|Tracks and locations of ''Perseverance'' and ''Ingenuity'' as of April 12, 2022<ref name=\"roadmaps\">{{cite web|title=Where is Perseverance?|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover| publisher=NASA|access-date=September 2, 2021|language=en}}</ref><!-- replaced with a multi-usage reference to this source-->]]\n''Perseverance'' dropped the debris shield protecting ''Ingenuity'' on March 21, 2021, and the helicopter deployed from the underside of the rover to the martian surface on April 3, 2021.<ref name=\"NASA-20210404\">{{cite web |title=NASA's Mars Helicopter Survives First Cold Martian Night on Its Own |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8906 |website=Nasa Mars Website}}</ref> That day both cameras of the helicopter were tested taking their first b/w and color photos of the floor of Jezero Crater in the shadow of the rover.<ref name=\"NASA-20200623b\">{{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|{{cite news|last1=Agle|first1=D.C.|last2=Hautaluoma |first2=Gray|last3=Johnson |first3=Alana |title=How NASA's Mars Helicopter Will Reach the Red Planet's Surface|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/8699 |date=23 June 2020|publisher=NASA|access-date=23 February 2021 |archive-date=19 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210219062523/https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/how-nasas-mars-helicopter-will-reach-the-red-planets-surface|url-status=live}} }}</ref><ref name=\"first color photo\">{{cite news|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25782|title=Ingenuity's First Color Snap|publisher=NASA|date=5 April 2021|access-date=8 April 2021}}</ref>\n\n''Ingenuity''{{'s}} rotor blades were successfully unlocked on April 8, 2021 (mission sol 48), and the helicopter performed a low-speed rotor spin test at 50 rpm.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-perseverance-rover-b1828663.html|title=NASA Unlocks Mars Helicopter's Rotor Blades Ahead Of Pioneering Ingenuity Flight|first=Andrew|last=Griffith|work=The Independent|date=8 April 2021|access-date=8 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.space.com/mars-helicopter-ingenuity-unlocks-rotor-blades|title=Mars helicopter Ingenuity unlocks its rotor blades to prepare for 1st flight on Red Planet|first=Meghan|last=Bartels|publisher=Space.com|date=8 April 2021|access-date=8 April 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"MEP-resources-25796\">{{cite web|title=Ingenuity Begins to Spin Its Blades|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25796/ingenuity-begins-to-spin-its-blades/|website=NASA's Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|date=9 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|number=1380404668069650437|user=NASAJPL|title=\ud83c\udfb6Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle \ud83c\udfb6 With just a little bit of swing, the #MarsHelicopter has moved its blades &amp; spun to 50\u2026|accessdate=18 April 2021|date=9 April 2021}}</ref><ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal |last=Latifiyan |first=Pouya |date=April 2021 |title=Space Telecommunications, how? |journal=Take off |publisher=[[Civil Aviation Technology College]] |publication-place=[[Tehran]] |volume=1 |pages=15 |via=[[Persian language|Persian]]}}</ref>\n\nA high-speed spin test was attempted on April 9, but failed due to the expiration of a [[watchdog timer]], a software measure to protect the helicopter from incorrect operation in unforeseen conditions.{{sfn|Status 291}} On April 12, JPL said it identified a software fix to correct the problem.{{sfn|Status 290}} To save time, however, JPL decided to use a workaround procedure, which managers said had an 85% chance of succeeding and would be \"the least disruptive\" to the helicopter.{{sfn|Status 293}}\n\nOn April 16, 2021, ''Ingenuity'' successfully passed the full-speed 2400 rpm rotor spin test while remaining on the surface.{{sfn|Status 292}}<ref name=\"Ingenuity passes full speed test\" /> Three days later, April 19, JPL flew the helicopter for the first time.

Up until the end of the 2010s, quite a few NASA leaders, scientists and JPL employees actively put forward counterarguments against the integration of a helicopter into the next expedition. For three years, the future ''Ingenuity'' has been developed outside the [[Mars 2020]] project and its budget.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Foust |first=Jeff |date=2018-05-04 |title=Decision expected soon on adding helicopter to Mars 2020 |url=https://spacenews.com/decision-expected-soon-on-adding-helicopter-to-mars-2020/ |access-date=2022-10-17 |website=SpaceNews |language=en-US}}</ref> When NASA management accepted assurances in the spring of 2018 that the addition of a helicopter would not harm the goals of the expedition, the chief scientist of this project<ref>{{Cite web |title=NASAFacts Mars 2020/Perseverance |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/files/mars2020/Mars2020_Fact_Sheet.pdf}}</ref>  Kenneth Farley stated that it does not follow from the fact that Ingenuity was taken on board that the team supported this decision even with guarantees of no risk:\n<blockquote>... \u201cI am not an advocate for the helicopter, and I don\u2019t believe the Mars 2020 project has been an advocate for the helicopter,\u201d.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web |last=Foust |first=Jeff |date=2018-05-04 |title=Decision expected soon on adding helicopter to Mars 2020 |url=https://spacenews.com/decision-expected-soon-on-adding-helicopter-to-mars-2020/ |access-date=2022-10-17 |website=SpaceNews |language=en-US}}</ref></blockquote>\nConvinced that the helicopter was a distraction of a group of scientists from a priority scientific task, unacceptable even for a short time, Farley concluded:\n<blockquote>\u2026This comes right out of science time\u2026 I have personally been opposed to it because we are working very hard for efficiencies and spending 30 days working on a technology demonstration does not further those goals directly from the science point of view.<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe skepticism on the part of NASA leadership was not unfounded. Scientists, engineers and managers proceeded from a pragmatic comparison of the benefits of additional aerial reconnaissance with the costs that inevitably fall on the schedule for the rover to complete all the tasks assigned to it. Back on April 30, arguing with MiMi Aung on the air of a joint conference, Jennifer Trosper warned that thanks to auto-navigation, the rover ultimately outpaces the helicopter. These calculations were first confirmed in the spring of 2022, when by the beginning of Sol 400 the helicopter did not take a leading position on the track along the slopes of the delta, although it covered a distance several times less than the rover. Due to the increased loss of time for recharging and transmitting telemetry, the attempt to bring the helicopter to the position of the route plotter, planned during the ascent to the delta, also failed.<ref>{{Cite web |last=mars.nasa.gov |title=Ingenuity Postpones Flights Until August |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/392/ingenuity-postpones-flights-until-august/ |access-date=2022-10-17 |website=mars.nasa.gov |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the \"test window\", NASA extended support for ''Ingenuity'' for another 30 sols, limiting the frequency of departures to 1 flight every few weeks. Later on, some of NASA's senior leaders seized the opportunity to dampen their enthusiasm for the Martian helicopter. Thus, addressing directly all the staff of the Mars 2020 project, the director of the Mars exploration program E. Janson and the principal Mars explorer M. Meyer urged the staff to \u201cbe highly disciplined and concentrate on collecting samples\u201d.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web |title=Mars Exploration Program Presentation to PAC |url=https://www.lpi.usra.edu/pac/presentations/0621/03-Meyer-Gramling-MEP-MSR-061421.pdf}}</ref> At the same time, in their report to the ''Planetary Advisory Committee'' (PAC) on June 14, 2021, the helicopter was mentioned only in the past tense: \u201cplaced Ingenuity and completed the technology demonstration phase\u201d.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Pushing the limits===\n{{Copy edit|section|date=November 2022}}\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 300\n| image1            = 22372 PIA23159-16 Mars Helicopter Prototype.jpg\n | caption1          = The prototype, which for the first time carried out on May 31, 2016 in a pressure chamber controlled flight in an atmosphere identical to that of Mars\n| image2            = PIA25338 Three models of Mars helicopter.jpg\n| caption2          = Artists conception showing one of Mars Sample Retrieval Helicopters collecting [[Mars 2020]] sample tubes while Mars Science Helicopter and ''Ingenuity'' are seen flying over Mars\n}}\n\nThe name ''operations demo'' (demonstration of operations), which appeared after the completion of the technology demonstration stage (''technology demo''), was a bureaucratic compromise that allowed to justify the funding of ''Ingenuity's'' \"extra\" flights after the previous stage was completed. Operations here refers to the joint work of two teams, ''Perseverance'' and ''Ingenuity'', proving the viability of the entire concept of the research complex, in which the planetary rover is a multifunctional self-propelled \"scientific combine\", and the aircraft is its auxiliary operational unit. In practice, already from the 6th flight, the work went beyond the demonstration of the interaction of vehicles. Engineers continued to identify \"weak spots\", not all of which could be identified in tests on Earth. In this work, the ''Ingenuity'' team has demonstrated the ability ''to improve beyond what has been achieved''. By the end of 2021, it turned out that the already distant deadlines for the possible implementation of improvements are pushed back by at least another 10 years. In the new 10-year concept of space exploration for the period up to 2032, the emphasis is on cheaper or low-cost projects.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Bioinspired Dragonfly Concept for Mars Exploration: Analogous to Mars Ingenuity Helicopter|url=https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lowcostmars2022/pdf/5007.pdf}}</ref> There are no plans to send ''Curiosity/Perseverance''-class scientific laboratories to Mars, and funding for Martian projects is frozen to the level necessary to complete the [[NASA-ESA Mars Sample-Return Mission|Mars sample-return campaign]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032 |url=https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/planetary-science-and-astrobiology-decadal-survey-2023-2032}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the idea of Martian helicopters was not shelved, but was further developed.

''Ingenuity'' needs to show the ability to accurately follow the track it has already \"mapped\" on previously collected NAV frame sets and land at the takeoff point. In a future sample return mission, each cartridge case would require a pair of flights ending at the point of departure. Landing accuracy was an assigned task of ''Ingenuity's'' 31st flight.<ref>{{Cite web |last=mars.nasa.gov |title=Ingenuity Team Spun Up for Upcoming Flight 30 |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/398/ingenuity-team-spun-up-for-upcoming-flight-30/ |access-date=2022-10-17 |website=mars.nasa.gov |language=en}}</ref> The very thin atmosphere of Mars does not allow repeating the maneuvers and landing techniques of terrestrial helicopters.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Inside Unmanned Systems: Inside the Ingenuity Helicopter|url=https://www.avinc.com/images/uploads/news/IUS_Ingenuity.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Design and Fabrication of the Mars Helicopter Rotor, Airframe, and Landing Gear Systems |url=https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=38208.0;attach=2018442}}</ref>\n\nThe special selection of a \"flat even surface\", which was discussed from the first flights,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Scientist |first=H\u00e5vard F.

This is predetermined by the very technology of orientation on two-dimensional images of the navigation camera, where the accuracy and the very possibility of obtaining a third dimension rests on the technical limitations of the [[lidar]]. On Earth, a mechanical gyroscope helps keep the drone horizontal. On Mars, the role of a gyroscope is performed by inertial sensors, and the physical altitude hold is carried out by changing the parameters of the blades to process the results of regular measurements from these sensors.

The Mars Science Helicopter, a proposed successor to ''Ingenuity'', would be a hexacopter, or six-rotor helicopter, with a mass of about {{cvt|30|kg}} compared to {{cvt|1.8|kg}} of ''Ingenuity''.

In principle, even the limit of 100 landings for the high-wear shock absorbers of the chassis is sufficient to transfer all 43 sleeves. Multiple small payloads can be carried by these types of helicopters, deployed and re-deployed to various locations, to perform a variety of distributed and networked operations - leading to new ways
