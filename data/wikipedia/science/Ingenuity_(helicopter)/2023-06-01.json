It is part of [[NASA]]'s [[Mars 2020]] mission, along with the [[Perseverance (rover)|''Perseverance'' rover]], which landed with ''Ingenuity'' attached to its underside on February 18, 2021. The helicopter was deployed to the surface on April 3, 2021.<ref name=\"ibtimes.com\"/><ref name=\"Universe2018\"/> On April 19, it successfully made the first powered controlled extraterrestrial flight by an aircraft, [[VTOL|taking off vertically]], hovering, and landing for a flight duration of 39.1&nbsp;seconds.<ref name=\"MarsDaily_2021_04_19\"/><ref name=\"Hotz2019\"/><ref name=\"NPR2021\"/> As of its [[List of Ingenuity flights|51st flight]] on April 23, 2023, the helicopter has been flightworthy for {{age in days|19 Apr 2021|23 Apr 2023}} days.\n\n''Ingenuity'' was designed by NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) in collaboration with [[AeroVironment]], NASA's [[Ames Research Center]] and [[Langley Research Center]].<ref name=\"Witold2018\"/> Other prominent contributors were [[Lockheed Martin Space]], [[Qualcomm]], and SolAero.<ref name=\"NASA_07_12_2021\"/>\n\nThe helicopter was intended to perform a 30-day technology demonstration, making five flights at altitudes ranging {{cvt|3|-|5|m|0}} for up to 90 seconds each.<ref name=\"landing press kit\" /><ref name=\"SpaceNews_20180504\"/> It started its mission on Mars at the [[Octavia E.

The idea for the project drew on prior concept work in the division. By January 2015 NASA agreed to fund the development of a full-size model, which came to be known as the \"risk reduction\" vehicle.<ref name=\"Lerner\"/>\nNASA's JPL and [[AeroVironment]] published the conceptual design in 2014 for a scout helicopter to accompany a rover.<ref name=\"Witold2018\" /><ref name=\"Balaram2014\"/><ref name=\"Pipenberg2019\"/> By mid-2016, $15 million was being requested to continue development of the helicopter.<ref name=\"ARS_Technica_2026_05_24\"/>\nBy December 2017, engineering models of the vehicle had been tested in a simulated [[Atmosphere of Mars|martian atmosphere]]<ref name=\"Balaram2018\"/><ref name=\"Aung May2018\"/> and models were undergoing testing in the [[Arctic]], but its inclusion in the mission had not yet been approved or funded.<ref name=\"All_About_Circuits_2017_11_29\"/>\n\n===Mission integration===\n\nAt the time of the approval of the ''Mars 2020'' program in July 2014,<ref name=\"NASA_2015_04_15\"/> a helicopter flight demonstration was neither scoped nor budgeted.<ref name=\"TheVerge_2018_05_11\"/>\n\nThe [[United States federal budget]], announced in March 2018, provided $23 million for the helicopter for one year,<ref name=\"SpaceNews_2018_02_23\"/><ref name=\"SpaceflightNow_2018_03_15\"/> and it was announced on May 11, 2018, that the helicopter could be developed and tested in time to be included in the [[Mars 2020]] mission.<ref name=\"NASA-20180511b\"/> The helicopter underwent extensive [[Flight dynamics|flight-dynamics]] and environment testing,<ref name=\"Balaram2018\"/><ref name=\"NASA-20190328\"/> and was mounted on the underside of the ''Perseverance'' rover in August 2019.<ref name=\"Integrated\">{{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|}}</ref> NASA spent about $80 million to build ''Ingenuity'' and about $5 million to operate the helicopter.<ref name=\"PK2020\"/>\n\nIn 2019, preliminary designs of ''Ingenuity'' were tested on Earth in simulated [[Atmosphere of Mars|Mars atmospheric]] and [[gravity]] conditions. For [[flight test]]ing, a large [[vacuum chamber]] was used to simulate the very low pressure of the [[atmosphere of Mars]] \u2013 filled with [[carbon dioxide]] to approximately 0.60% (about {{Frac|160}}) of standard atmospheric pressure at [[sea level]] on Earth \u2013 which is roughly equivalent to a helicopter flying at {{cvt|34000|m}} altitude in the [[atmosphere of Earth]]. In order to simulate the much-reduced gravity field of Mars (38% of Earth's), 62% of Earth's gravity was offset by a line pulling upwards during flight tests.<ref name=\"veritasium20190810\"/> A \"wind-wall\" consisting of almost 900 [[computer fan]]s was used to provide wind in the chamber. {{sfn|Status 289}}<ref name=\"PreflightBriefing\"/>{{rp|1:08:05\u20131:08:40}}\n\nIn April 2020, the vehicle was named ''Ingenuity'' by Vaneeza Rupani, a girl in the 11th grade at [[Tuscaloosa County High School]] in [[Northport, Alabama]], who submitted an essay into NASA's \"Name the Rover\" contest.<ref name=\"NASA-20200429a\"/><ref name=\"NASA-20200429b\"/> Known in planning stages as the Mars Helicopter Scout,<ref name=\"UASVision_2016_09_06\"/> or simply the Mars Helicopter,<ref name=\"NASA_2020_03_22\"/> the nickname '''''Ginny''''' later entered use in parallel to the parent rover ''Perseverance'' being affectionately referred to as ''Percy''.<ref name=\"NASA_APOD_2021_03_02\"/> Its full-scale engineering model for testing on Earth - '''Earth Copter''' and unofficially '''Terry'''.<ref name=\"CBS_2022_09_07\"/>\n\n''Ingenuity'' was designed to be a [[technology demonstrator]] by [[JPL]] to assess whether such a vehicle could fly safely. Before it was built, launched and landed, scientists and managers expressed hope that helicopters could provide better mapping and guidance that would give future mission controllers more information to help with travel routes, planning and hazard avoidance.<ref name=\"NASA-20180511b\"/><ref name=\"NYT-20180511\"/><ref name=\"TheVerge-20180511\"/> Based on the performance of previous rovers through ''Curiosity'', it was assumed that such aerial scouting might enable future rovers to safely drive up to three times as far per [[Timekeeping on Mars|sol]].<ref name=\"Gao2021\"/><ref name=\"NASA_2021_02_23\"/> However, the new AutoNav capability of ''Perseverance'' significantly reduced this advantage, allowing the rover to cover more than 100 meters per sol.<ref name=\"Ianson2022\"/>\n\n===Development team===\n[[File:Mars Helicopter Team (2018).jpg|thumb|The team photo from 2018 shows the relatively small size of the group responsible for developing ''Ingenuity'']]\n\nThe Ingenuity team was comparatively small, with never more than 65 full-time-equivalent employees at JPL.

Up until the end of the 2010s, several NASA leaders, scientists and JPL employees actively put forward counterarguments against the integration of a helicopter into the next expedition. For three years, the future ''Ingenuity'' has been developed outside the [[Mars 2020]] project and its budget.<ref name=\"SpaceNews_20180504\"/><ref name=\"Spectrum_2021_12_08\"/>  When NASA management accepted assurances in the spring of 2018 that the addition of a helicopter would not harm the goals of the expedition, the chief scientist of this project<ref name=\"NASA_M2020_Fact_Sheet\"/> Kenneth Farley stated that it does not follow from the fact that ''Ingenuity'' was taken on board that the team supported this decision even with guarantees of no risk.<ref name=\"SpaceNews_2022_10_17\"/> Farley was convinced that the helicopter was a distraction of a group of scientists from a priority scientific task, unacceptable even for a short time.<ref name=\"SpaceNews_2022_10_17\"/>\n\n[[File:Perseverance Distance Graph.svg|thumb|Comparison of total distance traveled between ''Ingenuity'' and ''Perseverance''.{{efn|name=note|Flights 1, 2 and 14 are not seen because they include little, if any, horizontal movement.}}]]\nThe skepticism on the part of NASA leadership was not unfounded. Scientists, engineers and managers proceeded from a pragmatic comparison of the benefits of additional aerial reconnaissance with the costs that inevitably fall on the schedule for the rover to complete all the tasks assigned to it. Arguing with MiMi Aung on the air of a joint conference, Jennifer Trosper warned that thanks to auto-navigation, the rover ultimately outpaces the helicopter. These calculations were first confirmed in the spring of 2022, when by the beginning of Sol 400 the helicopter did not take a leading position on the track along the slopes of the delta, although it covered a distance several times less than the rover. Due to the increased loss of time for recharging and transmitting telemetry, the attempt to bring the helicopter to the position of the route plotter, planned during the ascent to the delta, also failed.{{sfn|Status 392}}\n\nAt the end of the \"test window\", NASA extended support for ''Ingenuity'' for another 30 sols, limiting the frequency of departures to 1 flight every few weeks. Later on, some of NASA's senior leaders seized the opportunity to dampen their enthusiasm for the Martian helicopter. Thus, addressing directly all the staff of the Mars 2020 project, the director of the Mars exploration program E. Janson and the principal Mars explorer M. Meyer urged the staff to \u201cbe highly disciplined and concentrate on collecting samples\u201d.<ref name=\"Meyer_2021_06_14\"/> At the same time, in their report to the ''Planetary Advisory Committee'' (PAC) on June 14, 2021, the helicopter was mentioned only in the past tense: \"placed Ingenuity and completed the technology demonstration phase\".<ref name=\"Meyer_2021_06_14\"/>\n\nDespite this early pessimism, Ingenuity has since proved to be more than capable of keeping up with Perseverance, actually staying ahead of the rover for the majority of the traverse up the Jezero delta.{{sfn|Status 450}}\nInsufficient solar energy during the Martian winter was the main driver of poor operational performance in the latter half of 2022.{{sfn|Status 441}}\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Mechanical design ===\n[[file:Anatomy of the Mars Helicopter.png|thumb|The main components of ''Ingenuity''|upright=1.7]]\nIngenuity consists of a rectangular fuselage measuring {{Convert|136|x|195|x|163|mm|abbr=on}} suspended below a pair of [[coaxial rotors|coaxial counter-rotating rotors]] measuring {{cvt|1.21|m|ft|0}} in diameter.<ref name=\"landing press kit\"/><ref name=\"Aung May2018\"/><ref name=\"NASA_2020_03_22\"/> This assembly is supported by four landing legs of {{cvt|384|mm}} each.<ref name=\"landing press kit\"/> It also carries a [[solar cell|solar array]] mounted above the rotors to recharge its batteries.

The planet's [[atmospheric density]] is about {{frac|1|100}} that of Earth's at sea level, or about the same as {{cvt|87000|ft|m}}, an altitude never reached by existing helicopters. This density reduces even more in Martian winters. To keep ''Ingenuity'' aloft, its specially shaped blades of enlarged size must rotate between 2400 and 2900 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], or about 10 times faster<ref name=\"Aung May2018\" /> than what is needed on Earth.<ref name=\"Physorg_2021_04_21\"/><ref name=\"JPL_2021_01_21\"/> \nEach of the helicopter's [[contra-rotating]] [[coaxial rotors]] are controlled by a separate [[swashplate]] that can affect both [[Helicopter flight controls|collective and cyclic pitch]].<ref name=\"Grip2019\"/>\nAlthough it is an aircraft, it was constructed to spacecraft specifications to endure the acceleration and vibrations during launch.<ref name=\"JPL_2021_01_21\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Avionics===\n\n''Ingenuity'' relies on different sensor packages grouped in two assemblies. All sensors are commercial off-the-shelf units.\n\n[[File:Electronic Core Module of NASA\u2019s Ingenuity helicopter.png|350px|thumb|Structural design of internal hardware of ''Ingenuity'']]\nThe ''Upper Sensor Assembly,'' with associated vibration isolation elements, is mounted on the mast close to the vehicle's center-of-mass to minimize the effects of angular rates and accelerations. It consists of a cellphone-grade Bosch BMI-160 [[Inertial measurement unit]] (''IMU''); and an [[inclinometer]] ([[Murata Manufacturing|Murata]] SCA100T-D02), which is used only on the ground prior to flight to calibrate the IMU accelerometers biases. The ''Lower Sensor Assembly'' consists of an [[altimeter]] ([[Garmin]] [[Lidar|LIDAR]] Lite v3), cameras, and a secondary IMU, all mounted directly on the Electronics Core Module (not on the mast).\n\n''Ingenuity'' has two cameras: a downward-looking black-and-white navigation camera (NAV), and a color camera, for terrain images for return to Earth (RTE).<ref name=\"Balaram2018\" /> As Mars's magnetic field precludes the use of a [[compass]] for navigation, the down-facing [[Omnivision]] OV7251 camera is used for [[visual odometry]], where images are processed to produce navigation solutions that calculate the helicopter's position, velocity, [[Spacecraft attitude control|attitude]], and other variables.<ref name=\"Balaram2018\" />\n\n''Ingenuity'' uses a 425\u00d7165&nbsp;mm [[solar panels on spacecraft|solar panel]] to recharge its [[Electric battery|batteries]], which are six Sony [[Lithium-ion battery|Li-ion]] cells with {{cvt|35|-|40|Wh}} of [[Energy density|energy capacity]]<ref name=\"veritasium20190810\" /> ([[nameplate capacity]] of 2 [[Ampere hour|Ah]]).<ref name=\"Balaram2018\" /> Flight duration is not constrained by the available power, but by the motors heating up 1&nbsp;\u00b0C every second.<ref name=\"JPL_2021_04_30\"/>\nThe helicopter uses a [[Qualcomm Snapdragon]] 801 processor with a [[Linux]] operating system.<ref name=\"Spectrum_2021_02_17\"/> Among other functions, it controls the visual navigation algorithm via a velocity estimate derived from terrain features tracked with the navigation camera.<ref name=\"Matthies2019\"/> The Qualcomm processor is connected to two [[radiation-resistant]] [[Helicopter flight controls|flight-control]] [[microcontroller]] units (MCUs) to perform necessary control functions under Mars's conditions.<ref name=\"Balaram2018\" />\n\nThe telecommunication system consists of two identical radios with [[monopole antenna]]e for data exchange between the helicopter and rover. The radio link utilizes the low-power [[Zigbee]] [[communication protocol]]s, implemented via 914 [[Hertz|MHz]] SiFlex 02 [[chipset]]s mounted in both vehicles. The communication system is designed to relay data at 250&nbsp;[[kbit/s]] over distances of up to {{cvt|1000|m}}.<ref name=\"Chahat2020\" /> The antenna on the helicopter's solar panel weighs 4 grams and can communicate equally in all directions.<ref name=\"RennesUni_2021_04_10\"/>\n\n===Cameras and photography===\n[[File:PIA23969-Ingenuity Helicopter Imaging Suite.jpg|thumb|''Ingenuity'''s two cameras]]\n\n''Ingenuity'' has two commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) cameras. The Sony IMX 214 with 4208 x 3120-pixel resolution is a color camera with a [[rolling shutter]] to make terrain images for return to Earth (RTE). The Omnivision OV7251 (640 \u00d7 480) [[VGA]] is the black and white global shutter navigation camera (NAV), which supplies the onboard computer of the helicopter with crucial raw data for flight control.<ref name=\"Balaram2018\" />\n\nThe field of view of Ingenuity\u2019s Return to Earth (RTE) camera is pointed diagonally downward, capturing a relatively narrow range from slightly above the horizon to roughly 40 degrees below. This narrow field-of-view allows the camera to take beautifully detailed images of the Martian surface but leaves little room for error in targeting. Since the helicopter\u2019s attitude (yaw, pitch, roll) naturally fluctuates in response to external factors during flight, features near the boundaries of the planned image are often left outside the actual frame. Features that are far away are invariably near the horizon, and thus close to the edge of the camera\u2019s frame and difficult to capture reliably.<ref>{{Cite web |last=mars.nasa.gov |title=Hide and Seek - NASA |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/status/466/hide-and-seek/ |access-date=2023-05-27 |website=mars.nasa.gov |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhile the RTE color camera is not necessary for flights (as in flights 7 and 8{{sfn|Status 308}}), the NAV camera works throughout each flight, catching the first frame before takeoff and the last frame after landing. Its frame rate is synchronized with blade rotation to ease online image processing.\n\nDuring flight, all NAV frames must be carefully stored in the onboard helicopter computer, with each frame assigned the unique timestamp of its creation. The loss of a single NAV image timestamp was an anomaly that caused the helicopter to move erratically during flight 6.{{sfn|Status 305}}\n\n[[File:Antenna for Ingenuity and Sky Camera on Perseverance.png|thumb|right|The [[monopole antenna]] of the base station is mounted on a bracket in the right rear part of the rover]]\n\nThe longer a flight lasts, the more NAV photos must be stored. The frequency and timing of the camera's operations are predetermined due to storage issues; however, a huge number of NAV files does not overload the local storage of the helicopter. Less than 200 NAV files are uploaded to NASA's storage after each flight (ever since the eighth one), with a volume of about five megabytes.<!--JPEG compresses the raw 300-Kb of 640\u00d7480 256-color bitmap from 10 to 15 times (up to 20-35 Kb).--><ref name=\"NASA_2021_08_15_NavStats-sol174\" /> The limitations are imposed by weaknesses of local telecommunications; when landed, the helicopter relays data to the rover at a rate of 20 kbit/s.<ref name=\"Balaram2018\" /> Another setback is caused by the location of the antenna on the side of the rover. If it is turned to the wrong side to the helicopter, the rover body may impede signal reception.\n\nThe navigation camera has been programmed to deactivate whenever the rotorcraft is within {{cvt|1|m|ft}} of the surface. This helps ensure any dust kicked up during takeoff and landing will not interfere with the navigation system as it tracks features on the ground.<ref name=\"NASA_2022_05_27\"/>\n\nMost of the NAV files are not transmitted to the rover base station for return to Earth. JPL explained that navigation images are used by ''Ingenuity's'' flight computer and then discarded unless controllers tell the helicopter to store them for later use.{{sfn|Status 297}} ''Ingenuity'' captures navigation images at 30 frames per second and saves one image approximately every 700 milliseconds to be transmitted later to Earth and released to the public.<ref name=\"65dbNoise_2022_01_29\"/> Out of more than 4000 NAV files acquired on flight four, only 62 were stored.<ref name=\"NASA_NavStats-sol69\"/>\n\n[[File:Combination of two images, one each from Ingenuity's Navigation Camera and colour camera (RTE).jpg|thumb|Combination of two images, one each from ''Ingenuity'''s Navigation Camera and colour camera (RTE), taken while ''Ingenuity'' was on the ground.]]\nWith the end of the flight technology demonstration, ''Perseverance'' project manager Jennifer Trosper relinquished her team's responsibilities for photographing ''Ingenuity'' to concentrate exclusively on the rover science mission of searching for signs of ancient Martian life. Without pictures from the rover, the flight team relied heavily on photos taken by the helicopter NAV camera to confirm ''Ingenuity's'' location. The helicopter, however, does not create or refine the maps, but depends upon work coordinated by the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]]'s Astrogeology Science Center and performed by the NASA Mars and Lunar Cartography Working Groups.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\n[[File:Ingenuity flight 3 real-time animation.gif|left|thumb|''Ingenuity'' shadow captured during flight 3]]\n\nTo support the Mars-2020 mission, [[USGS]] used photos by the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ([[HiRISE]]) on the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (MRO) to produce Context Camera (CTX) and Digital Terrain Models (DTM) and [[Orthophoto|orthoimage]] mosaics. Those images were used by the Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) on the ''Perseverance'' descent vehicle to determine the safest landing location.<ref name=\"USGS_TRN\"/> Using maps created from photos and radar elevation data previously acquired by the MRO and other NASA missions, planetary cartographers manually correlate them with terrain features seen by ''Ingenuity's'' small and lens-distorted NAV images.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} After each NAV frame is assigned a [[Georeferencing|georeference]], the resulting flight maps are shown at NASA's Mars-2020 tracking service.<ref name=\"NASA_roadmaps\"/> NAV frames from ''Ingenuity'' are also used to produce moving images that show the Martian terrain passing under ''Ingenuity'' during its flights.\n\nIn November 2021, the ''Ingenuity'' team started to supply scientists with new types of images \u2014 color photos taken on the ground during the inter-flight periods. By December, scientists had received two such photos, the first one acquired on November 15 (sol 263)<ref name=NASA_Gnd263 /> and another on November 27 (sol 274).\n\nUnlike ''Perseverance'', ''Ingenuity'' does not have a special stereo camera for taking twin photos for [[Anaglyph 3D|3D pictures]] simultaneously. However, the helicopter has made such images by taking duplicate color photos of the same terrain while hovering in slightly offset positions, as in flight 11, or by taking an offset picture on the return leg of a roundtrip flight, as in flight 12.<ref name=\"SciTechDaily_2021_08_26\"/>\n\nAs of December 16, 2021, 2091 black-and-white images from the navigation camera<ref name=\"HELI_NAV\">{{cite web|title=Raw Images From Ingenuity Helicopter|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/?af=HELI_NAV#raw-images|website=NASA|date=30 April 2021|access-date=10 May 2021}} (NAV images)</ref> and 104 color images from the terrain camera (RTE)<ref name=\"HELI_RTE\">{{cite web|title=Raw Images From Ingenuity Helicopter|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/?af=HELI_RTE#raw-images|website=NASA|date=30 April 2021|access-date=10 May 2021}} (RTE images)</ref> have been published.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:1.1em; clear:left; font-size:95%; text-align:center; width:50%;\"\n|+ Count of stored images from both cameras per each flight<ref name=\"HELI_NAV\" />\n!

It communicates with the ''Perseverance'' rover directly before and after each landing.<ref name=\"PreflightBriefing\" />{{rp|1:20:38\u20131:22:20}}\n\nBefore Flight 34, the operations team has been at work installing a 4th major software update aboard the helicopter. This update provides ''Ingenuity'' two major new capabilities: hazard avoidance when landing and the use of digital elevation maps to help navigate.\n\n''Ingenuity'' was developed as a technology demonstration and designed to operate on Mars in flat, smooth terrain like that at [[Wright Brothers Field]]. As ''Ingenuity'' moved on to exploring [[Jezero (crater)|Jezero Crater]] alongside the ''Perseverance'' rover, it traveled through more challenging terrain than the team had ever anticipated.\n\nIn prior flights, ''Ingenuity''{{'}}s pilots have needed to find airfields free of any rocks or other obstacles that could potentially damage the vehicle when landing. Jezero Crater is rocky, meaning safe airfields have been tough to find. Using ''Ingenuity''{{'}}s downward-facing navigation camera, this software update adds hazard avoidance on landing to work like [[Hazard Avoidance Cameras]] on the rover. While in flight, ''Ingenuity'' will identify the safest visible landing site. When preparing to land, ''Ingenuity'' will then divert over to this selected site. This capability allows ''Ingenuity'' to safely land in rockier terrain than before, providing pilots with many more potential landing sites.\n\n''Ingenuity''{{'}}s navigation software was designed to assume the vehicle was flying over flat terrain. When the helicopter is flying over terrain like hills, this flat-ground assumption causes ''Ingenuity''\u2019s navigation software to think the vehicle is veering, causing it to start actually veering in an attempt to counter the error. Over long flights, navigation errors caused by rough terrain must be accounted for, requiring the team to select large airfields. This new software update corrects this flat-ground assumption by using digital elevation maps of Jezero Crater to help the navigation software distinguish between changes in terrain and vehicle movement. This increases ''Ingenuity''\u2019s accuracy, allowing the pilots to target smaller airfields going forward.{{sfn|Status 420}}\n\n===Specifications===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; margin:0.2em 0em 1em 1.5em;\"\n|+ Flight characteristics of ''Ingenuity''\n|-\n| {{rh}} class=\"table-rh\" | Rotor speed\n| 2400\u20132700 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]<ref name=\"landing press kit\"/><ref name=\"NASA_2020_03_22\"/>{{sfn|Status 334}}\n|-\n| {{rh}} class=\"table-rh\" | Blade tip speed\n| <0.7 [[Mach number|Mach]]<ref name=\"UASVision_2016_09_06\"/>\n|-\n| {{rh}} class=\"table-rh\" | Originally planned operational time\n| 1 to 5 flights within 30 sols<ref name=\"landing press kit\"/><ref name=\"NASA_2020_04_16\"/>\n|-\n| {{rh}} class=\"table-rh\" | Flight time\n| Up to 167 seconds per flight<ref name=\"JPL_2021_07_05\"/>\n|-\n| {{rh}} class=\"table-rh\" | Maximum range, flight\n| {{cvt|704|m}}\n|-\n| {{rh}} class=\"table-rh\" | Maximum range, radio\n| {{cvt|1000|m}}<ref name=\"Balaram2018\"/>\n|-\n| {{rh}} class=\"table-rh\" | Maximum altitude<!-- this is NOT a MaxAltitude for the helicopter in the martian atmosphere; it is merely the greatest distance above the ground that the helicopter has achieved-->\n| {{cvt|12|m}}\n|-\n| {{rh}} class=\"table-rh\" | Maximum possible speed\n| {{Unbulleted list\n| Horizontal: {{cvt|10|m/s}}<ref name=\"Witold2018\"/>\n| Vertical: {{cvt|3|m/s}}<ref name=\"Witold2018\"/>\n }}\n|-\n| {{rh}} class=\"table-rh\" | Battery capacity\n| {{cvt|35|-|40|Wh}}<ref name=\"veritasium20190810\"/>\n|}\n\n==Operational history==\n{{Main|List of Ingenuity flights{{!}}List of ''Ingenuity'' flights}}\n\nThe ''Ingenuity'' helicopter was originally intended to fly up to five times during a 30-day test campaign, early in the rover's mission.<ref name=\"landing press kit\" /><ref name=\"SpaceNews_20180504\" />\n\n=== Primary mission ===\n\n[[File:Ingenuity Helicopter with fully deployed legs (cropped).png|thumb|''Ingenuity'' hanging from the belly of the ''Perseverance'' rover during deployment to the Martian surface]]\n\n''Perseverance'' dropped the debris shield protecting ''Ingenuity'' on March 21, 2021, and the helicopter deployed from the underside of the rover to the martian surface on April 3, 2021.<ref name=\"NASA-20210404\"/> That day both cameras of the helicopter were tested taking their first b/w and color photos of the floor of Jezero Crater in the shadow of the rover.<ref name=\"NASA-20200623b\"/><ref name=\"NASA_2021_04_05\"/> After deployment, the rover drove approximately {{cvt|100|m}} away from the drone to allow a safe flying zone.<ref name=\"ibtimes.com\" /><ref name=\"Universe2018\" />\n\n''Ingenuity''{{'s}} rotor blades were successfully unlocked on April 8, 2021, (mission sol 48), and the helicopter performed a low-speed rotor spin test at 50 rpm.<ref name=\"Independent_2021_04_08\"/><ref name=\"Space_2021_04_08\"/><ref name=\"NASA_2021_04_09\"/><ref name=\"JPL_2021_04_09\"/><ref name=\"Latifiyan2021\"/>\n\nA high-speed spin test was attempted on April 9, but failed due to the expiration of a [[watchdog timer]], a software measure to protect the helicopter from incorrect operation in unforeseen conditions.{{sfn|Status 291}} On April 12, JPL said it identified a software fix to correct the problem.{{sfn|Status 290}} To save time, however, JPL decided to use a workaround procedure, which managers said had an 85% chance of succeeding and would be \"the least disruptive\" to the helicopter. {{sfn|Status 293}}\n\nOn April 16, 2021, ''Ingenuity'' successfully passed the full-speed 2400 rpm rotor spin test while remaining on the surface. {{sfn|Status 292}}<ref name=\"NASA-Tweet_20210417\" /> Three days later, April 19, JPL flew the helicopter for the first time. The watchdog timer problem occurred again when the fourth flight was attempted. The team rescheduled the flight, which succeeded on April 30. On June 25, JPL said it had uploaded a software update the previous week to permanently fix the watchdog problem, and that a rotor spin test and the eighth flight confirmed that the update worked.{{sfn|Status 308}}\n\nEach flight was planned for altitudes ranging {{cvt|3|-|5|m|0}} above the ground, though ''Ingenuity'' soon exceeded that planned height.<ref name=\"landing press kit\" /> The first flight was a hover at an altitude of {{cvt|3|m}}, lasting about 40 seconds and including taking a picture of the rover. The first flight succeeded, and subsequent flights were increasingly ambitious as allotted time for operating the helicopter dwindled. JPL said the mission might even stop before the 30-day period ended, in the likely event that the helicopter crashed,<ref name=\"PreflightBriefing\" />{{rp|0:49:50\u20130:51:40}} an outcome which did not occur.

Ingenuity flew through a transitional phase of two flights, flight 4 and 5 before transitioning to its operations demonstration phase.<ref name=\"NASA_2021_04_30_New_Phase\"/>\n\n=== Operations Demo Phase ===\n\nJust prior to the final demonstration flight, on April 30, 2021, NASA allocated funding to continue the operation of ''Ingenuity'' for an \u201coperational demonstration phase\u201d to explore using a helicopter as supplementary reconnaissance for ground assets like ''Perseverance''.<ref name=\"NASA_2021_04_30_New_Phase\"/> Funding for ''Ingenuity'' is regularly renewed on a monthly basis.<ref name=\"Extremetech_2021_09_08\"/>\n\nStarting with the 6th flight, the mission goal shifted towards supporting the rover science mission by mapping and scouting the terrain.<ref name=\"IFLScience_2021_04_30\"/> While ''Ingenuity'' would do more to help ''Perseverance'', the rover would pay less attention to the helicopter and stop taking pictures of it in flight. JPL managers said the photo procedure took an \"enormous\" amount of time, slowing the project's main mission of looking for signs of ancient life.<ref name=\"Space_2021_06_10\"/> On 30 April 2021, the fourth flight successfully captured numerous color photos and explored the surface with its black-and-white navigation camera.{{sfn|Status 297}} On May 7, ''Ingenuity'' successfully flew to a new landing site.\n\n[[File:Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover Traverse Path And Ingenuity Helicopter Flight Path (including sampling locations).png|thumb|388x388px|Tracks and locations of ''Perseverance'' and ''Ingenuity'' as of January 11, 2023<ref name=\"NASA_roadmaps\"/><!-- replaced with a multi-usage reference to this source-->]]\n\nAfter 12 flights by September 2021, the mission was extended indefinitely.<ref name=\"ScienceAlert_2021_09_06\"/> After 21 flights by March 2022, NASA said it would continue flying ''Ingenuity'' until at least the coming September. The area of the helicopter's next goal is more rugged than the relatively flat terrain it flew over in its first year of operation. The ancient fan-shaped river delta has jagged cliffs, angled surfaces and projecting boulders. ''Ingenuity'' will help the mission team decide which route ''Perseverance'' should take to the top of the delta and may aid in analyzing potential science targets. Software updates will eliminate the helicopter's 50-foot altitude limit, allow it to change speed in flight, and improve its understanding of terrain texture below it. NASA associate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen said less than a year earlier \"we didn't even know if powered, controlled flight of an aircraft at Mars was possible.\" He said the transformation in understanding what the aircraft can do is \"one of the most historic in the annals of air and space exploration.\"<ref name=NASA_2022_3_15/>\n\nThe ''Ingenuity'' team plans to fly the helicopter every two to three weeks during its indefinitely extended mission.<ref name=\"ScienceAlert_2021_09_06\"/> The helicopter's longer-than-expected flying career lasted into a seasonal change on Mars, when the atmospheric density at its location became even lower. The flight team prepared by commanding ''Ingenuity'' to ground test a faster rotor blade rotation, needed for sufficient lift. JPL said the higher planned flight speed of 2700 rpm would pose new risks, including vibration, power consumption and aerodynamic drag if the blade tips approach the speed of sound.{{sfn|Status 334}} The test speed was 2800 rpm, giving a margin for increase if the intended flight speed of 2700 is not enough. ''Ingenuity'' faced another challenge to remain functional during the Martian winter and [[solar conjunction]], when Mars moves behind the Sun, blocking communications with Earth and forcing the rover and helicopter to halt operations. The shutdown happened in mid-October 2021, for which preparations started in mid-September.<ref name=\"NASA_2021_04_30_New_Phase\"/><ref name=\"NASA_2021_08_18\"/> The helicopter remained stationary at its location {{convert|575|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|order=flip}} away from ''Perseverance'' and communicated its status weekly to the rover for health checks.<ref name=\"NASA_2021_09_28\"/> JPL intended to continue flying ''Ingenuity'' since it survived solar conjunction.<ref name=\"BusinessInsider_2021_08_30\"/><ref name=\"NDTV_2021_09_05\"/> NASA leadership has stated that extending the mission will increase the project's expenses, but that they believe the cost to be worthwhile for the information learned.<ref name=\"UPI_2021_12_09\"/>\n\nThe start time of a flight is chosen depending on temperature management of the batteries, which need to warm up after the night. During Martian summer lower air density imposed a higher load on the motors, so flights were shifted from noon (LMST 12:30) to morning (LMST 9:30) and limited to 130&nbsp;seconds to not overheat the motors.{{sfn|Status 373}}\n\nOn May 3 and 4, 2022, for the first time in the mission, the helicopter unexpectedly failed to communicate with the rover, following the 28th flight on April 29.{{sfn|Status 382}} JPL determined that ''Ingenuity'''s rechargeable batteries suffered a power drop or insufficient battery state-of-charge (SOC) while going into the night, most likely because of a seasonal increase in atmospheric dust reducing sunshine on its solar panel and due to lower temperatures as winter approached. When the battery pack's state of charge dropped below a lower limit, the helicopter's [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA) powered down, resetting the mission clock, which lost sync with the base station on the rover. Contact was re-established on May 5. Controllers decided to turn off the helicopter's heaters at night to conserve power, accepting the risk of exposing components to nighttime's extreme cold.{{sfn|Status 379}}\nThis daily SOC deficit is likely to persist for the duration of Martian winter (at least until September/October). Each sol could be Ingenuity's last.{{sfn|Status 382}}\n\nIn a June 6, 2022, update, JPL reported ''Ingenuity's'' inclination sensor had stopped working. Its purpose was to determine the helicopter's orientation at the start of each flight. Mission controllers developed a workaround using the craft's inertial measurement unit (IMU) to provide equivalent data to the onboard navigation computer.{{sfn|Status 385}}\n\nIn January 2023, the helicopter began to have enough solar power to avoid overnight brownouts and FPGA resets due to the start of Martian spring.{{sfn|Status 441}} This means the helicopter will be able to fly more frequently and over longer distances.\n\nIn March 2023, the helicopter made frequent flights to deal with limited radio range in the rough terrain of the Jezero delta. In the narrow canyons of the river delta its impossible to pass the rover without violating the wide keep out zone.{{sfn|Status 450}}\n\n== Follow-on missions and future work ==\n\nThere are currently no plans to send ''Curiosity/Perseverance''-class scientific laboratories to Mars, and funding for Martian projects is frozen to the level necessary to complete the [[NASA-ESA Mars Sample-Return Mission|Mars sample-return campaign]].<ref name=\"NationalAcademies_Decadal2023\"/>\n\n=== Sample Return Helicopter ===\n\n[[File:PIA25338 Three models of Mars helicopter.jpg|thumb|Sample Return Helicopter, based on ''Ingenuity'']]\n\nThe idea of future Martian helicopters has been proposed. In March 2022, AeroVironment engineers, who previously created ''Ingenuity'', presented the concept of [[Mars Sample Retrieval Helicopter|a new helicopter]] with a payload of 280 g. A 90 g small manipulator arm with a two-fingered gripper and a self-propelled landing gear make it possible to use vehicles of this type instead of a fetch rover<ref name=\"SpaceNews_2022_07_27\"/> to select sample tubes cases with samples collected by ''Perseverance''.<ref name=\"Pipenberg2022\"/> At a briefing on September 15, 2022, NASA Planetary Science Division Director Laurie Gleizes confirmed her intention to use two of these helicopters.<ref name=\"NASA_2022_09_15\"/>\n\nThe choice of ''Ingenuity'' as the prototype for the intended pair of assembler helicopters was based on the impressive safety margin built into it by [[AeroVironment]] designers. In principle, even the limit of 100 landings for the high-wear shock absorbers of the chassis is sufficient to transfer all 43 sleeves. Multiple small payloads can be carried by these types of helicopters, deployed and re-deployed to various locations, to perform a variety of distributed and networked operations.{{sfn|Status 417}}\n\nInertial navigation was one of the main challenges on Mars for the ''Ingenuity''. The helicopter needs to show the ability to accurately follow the track it has already \"mapped\" on previously collected NAV frame sets and land at the takeoff point. In a future sample return mission, each cartridge case would require a pair of flights ending at the point of departure.
