Up until the end of the 2010s, several NASA leaders, scientists and JPL employees actively put forward counterarguments against the integration of a helicopter into the next expedition.

Scientists, engineers and managers proceeded from a pragmatic comparison of the benefits of additional aerial reconnaissance with the costs that inevitably fall on the schedule for the rover to complete all the tasks assigned to it. Arguing with MiMi Aung on the air of a joint conference, [[Jennifer Harris Trosper|Jennifer Trosper]] warned that thanks to auto-navigation, the rover ultimately outpaces the helicopter. These calculations were first confirmed in the spring of 2022 when by the beginning of Sol 400 the helicopter did not take a leading position on the track along the slopes of the delta, although it covered a distance several times less than the rover. Due to the increased loss of time for recharging and transmitting telemetry, the attempt to bring the helicopter to the position of the route plotter, planned during the ascent to the delta, also failed.{{sfn|Status 392}}\n\nAt the end of the \"test window\", NASA extended support for ''Ingenuity'' for another 30 sols, limiting the frequency of departures to 1 flight every few weeks. Later on, some of NASA's senior leaders seized the opportunity to dampen their enthusiasm for the Martian helicopter. Thus, addressing directly all the staff of the Mars 2020 project, the director of the Mars exploration program E. Janson and the principal Mars explorer M. Meyer urged the staff to \u201cbe highly disciplined and concentrate on collecting samples\u201d.<ref name=\"Meyer_2021_06_14\"/> At the same time, in their report to the ''Planetary Advisory Committee'' (PAC) on June 14, 2021, the helicopter was mentioned only in the past tense: \"placed Ingenuity and completed the technology demonstration phase\".<ref name=\"Meyer_2021_06_14\"/>\n\nDespite this early pessimism, Ingenuity has since proved to be more than capable of keeping up with Perseverance, actually staying ahead of the rover for the majority of the traverse up the Jezero delta.{{sfn|Status 450}}\nInsufficient solar energy during the Martian winter was the main driver of poor operational performance in the latter half of 2022.{{sfn|Status 441}}\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Mechanical design ===\n[[file:Anatomy of the Mars Helicopter.png|thumb|The main components of ''Ingenuity''|upright=1.7]]\n''Ingenuity'' consists of a rectangular fuselage measuring {{Convert|136|x|195|x|163|mm|abbr=on}} suspended below a pair of [[coaxial rotors|coaxial counter-rotating rotors]] measuring {{cvt|1.21|m|ft|0}} in diameter.<ref name=\"landing press kit\"/><ref name=\"Aung May2018\"/><ref name=\"NASA_2020_03_22\"/> This assembly is supported by four landing legs of {{cvt|384|mm}} each.<ref name=\"landing press kit\"/> It also carries a [[solar cell|solar array]] mounted above the rotors to recharge its batteries.

The watchdog timer problem occurred again when the fourth flight was attempted. The team rescheduled the flight, which succeeded on April 30. On June 25, JPL said it had uploaded a software update the previous week to permanently fix the watchdog problem, and that a rotor spin test and the eighth flight confirmed that the update worked.{{sfn|Status 308}}\n\nEach flight was planned for altitudes ranging {{cvt|3|-|5|m|0}} above the ground, though ''Ingenuity'' soon exceeded that planned height.<ref name=\"landing press kit\" /> The first flight was a hover at an altitude of {{cvt|3|m}}, lasting about 40 seconds and including taking a picture of the rover. The first flight succeeded, and subsequent flights were increasingly ambitious as allotted time for operating the helicopter dwindled. JPL said the mission might even stop before the 30-day period ended, in the likely event that the helicopter crashed,<ref name=\"PreflightBriefing\" />{{rp|0:49:50\u20130:51:40}} an outcome which did not occur.

JPL managers said the photo procedure took an \"enormous\" amount of time, slowing the project's main mission of looking for signs of ancient life.<ref name=\"Space_2021_06_10\"/> On 30 April 2021, the fourth flight successfully captured numerous color photos and explored the surface with its black-and-white navigation camera.{{sfn|Status 297}} On May 7, ''Ingenuity'' successfully flew to a new landing site.<ref>{{Cite web |last=mars.nasa.gov |title=Location Map for Perseverance Rover - NASA |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/ |access-date=2023-09-26 |website=mars.nasa.gov |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ingenuity total flight path after flight 64.png|thumb|''Ingenuity'' total flight path after flight 64, Oct 27 2023]]\n\nAfter 12 flights by September 2021, the mission was extended indefinitely.<ref name=\"ScienceAlert_2021_09_06\"/> After 21 flights by March 2022, NASA said it would continue flying ''Ingenuity'' until at least the coming September. The area of the helicopter's next goal is more rugged than the relatively flat terrain it flew over in its first year of operation. The ancient fan-shaped river delta has jagged cliffs, angled surfaces and projecting boulders. ''Ingenuity'' will help the mission team decide which route ''Perseverance'' should take to the top of the delta and may aid in analyzing potential science targets. Software updates will eliminate the helicopter's 50-foot altitude limit, allow it to change speed in flight, and improve its understanding of terrain texture below it. NASA associate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen said less than a year earlier \"we didn't even know if powered, controlled flight of an aircraft at Mars was possible.\" He said the transformation in understanding what the aircraft can do is \"one of the most historic in the annals of air and space exploration.\"<ref name=NASA_2022_3_15/>\n\nThe ''Ingenuity'' team plans to fly the helicopter every two to three weeks during its indefinitely extended mission.<ref name=\"ScienceAlert_2021_09_06\"/> The helicopter's longer-than-expected flying career lasted into a seasonal change on Mars, when the atmospheric density at its location became even lower. The flight team prepared by commanding ''Ingenuity'' to ground test a faster rotor blade rotation, needed for sufficient lift. JPL said the higher planned flight speed of 2700 rpm would pose new risks, including vibration, power consumption and aerodynamic drag if the blade tips approach the speed of sound.{{sfn|Status 334}} The test speed was 2800 rpm, giving a margin for increase if the intended flight speed of 2700 is not enough. ''Ingenuity'' faced another challenge to remain functional during the Martian winter and [[solar conjunction]], when Mars moves behind the Sun, blocking communications with Earth and forcing the rover and helicopter to halt operations. The shutdown happened in mid-October 2021, for which preparations started in mid-September.<ref name=\"NASA_2021_04_30_New_Phase\"/><ref name=\"NASA_2021_08_18\"/> The helicopter remained stationary at its location {{convert|575|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|order=flip}} away from ''Perseverance'' and communicated its status weekly to the rover for health checks.<ref name=\"NASA_2021_09_28\"/> JPL intended to continue flying ''Ingenuity'' since it survived solar conjunction.<ref name=\"BusinessInsider_2021_08_30\"/><ref name=\"NDTV_2021_09_05\"/> NASA leadership has stated that extending the mission will increase the project's expenses, but that they believe the cost to be worthwhile for the information learned.<ref name=\"UPI_2021_12_09\"/>\n\nThe start time of a flight is chosen depending on temperature management of the batteries, which need to warm up after the night. During Martian summer lower air density imposed a higher load on the motors, so flights were shifted from noon (LMST 12:30) to morning (LMST 9:30) and limited to 130&nbsp;seconds to not overheat the motors.{{sfn|Status 373}}\n\nOn May 3 and 4, 2022, for the first time in the mission, the helicopter unexpectedly failed to communicate with the rover, following the 28th flight on April 29.{{sfn|Status 382}} JPL determined that ''Ingenuity'''s rechargeable batteries suffered a power drop or insufficient battery state-of-charge (SOC) while going into the night, most likely because of a seasonal increase in atmospheric dust reducing sunshine on its solar panel and due to lower temperatures as winter approached. When the battery pack's state of charge dropped below a lower limit, the helicopter's [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA) powered down, resetting the mission clock, which lost sync with the base station on the rover. Contact was re-established on May 5. Controllers decided to turn off the helicopter's heaters at night to conserve power, accepting the risk of exposing components to nighttime's extreme cold.{{sfn|Status 379}}\nThis daily SOC deficit is likely to persist for the duration of Martian winter (at least until September/October).{{sfn|Status 382}}\n\nIn a June 6, 2022, update, JPL reported ''Ingenuity's'' inclination sensor had stopped working. Its purpose was to determine the helicopter's orientation at the start of each flight. Mission controllers developed a workaround using the craft's inertial measurement unit (IMU) to provide equivalent data to the onboard navigation computer.{{sfn|Status 385}}\n\nIn January 2023, the helicopter began to have enough solar power to avoid overnight brownouts and FPGA resets due to the start of Martian spring.{{sfn|Status 441}} This means the helicopter will be able to fly more frequently and over longer distances.\n\nIn March 2023, the helicopter made frequent flights to deal with limited radio range in the rough terrain of the Jezero delta. In the narrow canyons of the river delta it's impossible to pass the rover without violating the wide keep out zone.{{sfn|Status 450}}\n\n== Follow-on missions and future work ==\n\nThere are currently no plans to send ''Curiosity/Perseverance''-class scientific laboratories to Mars, and funding for Martian projects is frozen to the level necessary to complete the [[NASA-ESA Mars Sample-Return Mission|Mars sample-return campaign]].<ref name=\"NationalAcademies_Decadal2023\"/>\n\n=== Sample Return Helicopter ===\n\n[[File:PIA25338 Three models of Mars helicopter.jpg|thumb|Sample Return Helicopter, based on ''Ingenuity'']]\n\nThe idea of future Martian helicopters has been proposed. In March 2022, AeroVironment engineers, who previously created ''Ingenuity'', presented the concept of [[Mars Sample Retrieval Helicopter|a new helicopter]] with a payload of 280 g. A 90 g small manipulator arm with a two-fingered gripper and a self-propelled landing gear make it possible to use vehicles of this type instead of a fetch rover<ref name=\"SpaceNews_2022_07_27\"/> to select sample tubes cases with samples collected by ''Perseverance''.<ref name=\"Pipenberg2022\"/> At a briefing on September 15, 2022, NASA Planetary Science Division Director Laurie Gleizes confirmed her intention to use two of these helicopters.<ref name=\"NASA_2022_09_15\"/>\n\nThe choice of ''Ingenuity'' as the prototype for the intended pair of assembler helicopters was based on the impressive safety margin built into it by [[AeroVironment]] designers. In principle, even the limit of 100 landings for the high-wear shock absorbers of the chassis is sufficient to transfer all 43 sleeves. Multiple small payloads can be carried by these types of helicopters, deployed and re-deployed to various locations, to perform a variety of distributed and networked operations.{{sfn|Status 417}}\n\nInertial navigation was one of the main challenges on Mars for the ''Ingenuity''. The helicopter needs to show the ability to accurately follow the track it has already \"mapped\" on previously collected NAV frame sets and land at the takeoff point. In a future sample return mission, each cartridge case would require a pair of flights ending at the point of departure. Landing accuracy was an assigned task of ''Ingenuity's'' 31st flight.{{sfn|Status 398}} The very thin atmosphere of Mars does not allow repeating the maneuvers and landing techniques of terrestrial
