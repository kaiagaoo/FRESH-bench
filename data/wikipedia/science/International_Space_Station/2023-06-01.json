It provided propulsion, [[Spacecraft attitude control|attitude control]], communications, and electrical power, but lacked long-term life support functions. A passive NASA module, ''Unity'', was launched two weeks later aboard Space Shuttle flight [[STS-88]] and attached to ''Zarya'' by astronauts during EVAs. The ''Unity'' module has two [[Pressurized Mating Adapter|Pressurised Mating Adapters]] (PMAs): one connects permanently to ''Zarya'' and the other allowed the Space Shuttle to dock to the space station. At that time, the Russian (Soviet) station ''Mir'' was still inhabited, and the ISS remained uncrewed for two years. On 12&nbsp;July 2000, the ''Zvezda'' module was launched into orbit. Onboard preprogrammed commands deployed its [[solar array]]s and communications antenna. ''Zvezda'' then became the passive target for a rendezvous with ''Zarya'' and ''Unity'', maintaining a station-keeping orbit while the ''Zarya''\u2013''Unity'' vehicle performed the rendezvous and docking via ground control and the Russian automated rendezvous and docking system. ''Zarya''{{'s}} computer transferred control of the station to ''Zvezda''{{'s}} computer soon after docking.

Before the launch of this airlock, EVAs were performed from either the U.S. Space Shuttle (while docked) or from the Transfer Chamber on the Service Module. Due to a variety of system and design differences, only U.S. space suits could be used from the Shuttle and only Russian suits could be used from the Service Module. The Joint Airlock alleviates this short-term problem by allowing either (or both) spacesuit systems to be used.\nThe Joint Airlock was launched on ISS-7A / STS-104 in July 2001 and was attached to the right hand docking port of Node 1. The Joint Airlock is 20&nbsp;ft. long, 13&nbsp;ft. in diameter, and weighs 6.5 tons. The Joint Airlock was built by Boeing at Marshall Space Flight Center. The Joint Airlock was launched with the High Pressure Gas Assembly. The High Pressure Gas Assembly was mounted on the external surface of the Joint Airlock and will support EVAs operations with breathing gases and augments the Service Module's gas resupply system.\nThe Joint Airlock has two main components: a crew airlock from which astronauts and cosmonauts exit the ISS and an equipment airlock designed for storing EVA gear and for so-called overnight \"campouts\" wherein Nitrogen is purged from astronaut's bodies overnight as pressure is dropped in preparation for spacewalks the following day. This alleviates the bends as the astronauts are repressurized after their EVA.\n\nThe crew airlock was derived from the Space Shuttle's external airlock. It is equipped with lighting, external handrails, and an Umbilical Interface Assembly (UIA). The UIA is located on one wall of the crew airlock and provides a water supply line, a wastewater return line, and an oxygen supply line. The UIA also provides communication gear and spacesuit power interfaces and can support two spacesuits simultaneously. This can be either two American EMU spacesuits, two Russian ORLAN spacesuits, or one of each design.\n\n====''Poisk''====\n{{main|2 = Poisk (ISS module)}}\n''Poisk'' ({{lang-ru|\u041f\u043e\u0301\u0438\u0441\u043a||Search|links=no}}) was launched on 10&nbsp;November 2009<ref name=\"energia0828\">{{Cite news|date=2009-08-28|title=August 28, 2009.

Although NASA has only commissioned one module, Axiom plans to build an entire segment consisting of five modules, including a node module, an orbital research and manufacturing facility, a crew habitat, and a \"large-windowed Earth observatory\". The Axiom segment is expected to greatly increase the capabilities and value of the space station, allowing for larger crews and private spaceflight by other organisations. Axiom plans to convert the segment into a stand-alone space station once the ISS is decommissioned, with the intention that this would act as a successor to the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=2020-01-28 |title=Axiom wins NASA approval to attach commercial habitat to space station |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/01/28/axiom-wins-nasa-approval-to-attach-commercial-habitat-to-space-station/ |access-date=2020-01-29 |website=Spaceflight Now |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=NASA taps startup Axiom Space for the first habitable commercial module for the Space Station |url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/nasa-taps-startup-axiom-space-for-the-first-habitable-commercial-module-for-the-space-station/ |access-date=2020-01-29 |website=TechCrunch |date=27 January 2020 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2020-01-28 |title=NASA clears Axiom Space to put commercial habitat on space station, with Boeing on the team |url=https://www.geekwire.com/2020/nasa-clears-axiom-space-put-commercial-habitat-space-station-boeings-help/ |access-date=2020-01-29 |website=GeekWire |language=en-US}}</ref> Canadarm 2 will also help to berth the [[Axiom Orbital Segment|Axiom Space Station]] modules to the [[ISS]] and will continue its operations on the Axiom Space Station after the retirement of ISS in late 2020s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Axiom Station Assembly Sequence \u2013 Axiom Space Axiom Space |url=https://www.axiomspace.com/axiom-station/assembly-sequence|access-date=2021-08-09|website=[[Axiom Space]]}}</ref>\n\n===Proposed components===\n\n====Xbase====\n{{main|B330}}\nMade by [[Bigelow Aerospace]].

The spacecraft docking mechanisms typically enter what is called soft capture, followed by a load attenuation phase, and then the hard docked position which establishes an air-tight structural connection between spacecraft. Berthing, by contrast, is when an incoming spacecraft is grappled by a robotic arm and its interface mechanism is placed in close proximity of the stationary interface mechanism. Then typically there is a capture process, coarse alignment and fine alignment and then structural attachment.}}</ref>\n\n# ''[[Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony]]'' forward (with [[International Docking Adapter|''IDA 2'']])\n# ''Harmony'' zenith (with [[International Docking Adapter|''IDA 3'']])\n# ''Harmony'' nadir\n# ''[[Unity (ISS module)|Unity]]'' nadir\n# ''[[Prichal (ISS module)|Prichal]]'' nadir\n# ''[[Prichal (ISS module)|Prichal]]'' aft\n# ''[[Prichal (ISS module)|Prichal]]'' forward\n# ''[[Prichal (ISS module)|Prichal]]'' starboard\n# ''[[Prichal (ISS module)|Prichal]]'' port\n# ''[[Poisk (ISS module)|Poisk]]'' zenith\n# ''[[Rassvet (ISS module)|Rassvet]]'' nadir\n# ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' aft\n\n==== Crewed ====\n{{Main|List of human spaceflights to the International Space Station}}\n{{As of|2021|December|30|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/visitors-to-the-station-by-country/}}, 256 people from 20 countries had visited the space station, many of them multiple times.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, Cygnus and Dragon, carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons.

When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, ISS crews are exposed to approximately one [[millisievert]] each day (about a year's worth of natural exposure on Earth), resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the DNA and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocyte]]s; being central to the [[immune system]], any damage to these cells could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts.

But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging six months in duration. These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS. During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.<ref name=MMOP_SSP_50260 />{{rp|5.7.3}} During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards. The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS. The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[noise barrier]]s, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels, this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[ambient noise level]]s.\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members. The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits. One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[hearing protection device]]s (HPDs). Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions.\n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.<ref>{{cite web |date=2020 |title=Safe in Sound Winners |url=https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200625051514/https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html |archive-date=2020-06-25 |website=safeinsound.us}}</ref>\n\n====Fire and toxic gases====\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.
