At the time, the Russian station ''[[Mir]]'' was still inhabited.\n\nThe turning point arrived in July 2000 with the launch of the ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' module.

Several more truss segments and a third set of arrays were delivered on [[STS-116]], [[STS-117]], and [[STS-118]]. As a result of the major expansion of the station's power-generating capabilities, more modules could be accommodated, and the US ''[[Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony]]'' module and ''[[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]]'' European laboratory were added.

''Leonardo'' is primarily used for storage of spares, supplies and waste on the ISS, which was until then stored in many different places within the space station. It is also the personal hygiene area for the astronauts who live in the [[US Orbital Segment]]. The ''Leonardo'' PMM was a [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] (MPLM) before 2011, but was modified into its current configuration. It was formerly one of two MPLM used for bringing cargo to and from the ISS with the Space Shuttle.

The Axiom segment was expected to greatly increase the capabilities and value of the space station, allowing for larger crews and private spaceflight by other organisations.

To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid [[ammonia]] loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then the ammonia is cycled back to the station.<ref name=\"nasa-stayingcool\">{{Cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/|title=Staying Cool on the ISS|last1=Price|first1=Steve|last2=Phillips|first2=Tony|last3=Knier|first3=Gil|date=21 March 2001|publisher=[[NASA]]|access-date=22 July 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230203012526/https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/|archive-date=3 February 2023}}</ref> The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses.

Berthing, by contrast, is when an incoming spacecraft is grappled by a robotic arm and its interface mechanism is placed in close proximity of the stationary interface mechanism. Then typically there is a capture process, coarse alignment and fine alignment and then structural attachment.|conference=AIAA Space}}</ref>\n\n# ''[[Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony]]'' forward (with [[Pressurized Mating Adapter|''PMA 2'']] & [[International Docking Adapter|''IDA 2'']])\n# ''Harmony'' zenith (with [[Pressurized Mating Adapter|''PMA 3'']] & [[International Docking Adapter|''IDA 3'']])\n# ''Harmony'' nadir ([[Common Berthing Mechanism|CBM]] port)\n# ''[[Unity (ISS module)|Unity]]'' nadir ([[Common Berthing Mechanism|CBM]] port)\n# ''[[Prichal (ISS module)|Prichal]]'' aft{{Efn|The Prichal aft, forward, port and starboard ports still have their protective covers in place and have yet to be used since the module originally docked at the station.|name=Prichal}}\n# ''Prichal'' forward{{Efn|name=Prichal}}\n# ''Prichal'' nadir\n# ''Prichal'' port{{Efn|name=Prichal}}\n# ''Prichal'' starboard{{Efn|name=Prichal}}\n# ''[[Poisk (ISS module)|Poisk]]'' zenith\n# ''[[Rassvet (ISS module)|Rassvet]]'' nadir\n# ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' aft\nForward ports are at the front of the station according to its normal direction of travel and orientation ([[Yaw, pitch and roll#Aircraft attitudes|attitude]]).

Once within approximately {{Convert|200|km}}, the spacecraft begins receiving radio signals from the [[Kurs (docking navigation system)|Kurs docking navigation system]] on the station. As the spacecraft nears the station, laser-based optical equipment precisely aligns the craft with the docking port and controls the final approach. While the crew on the ISS and spacecraft monitor the procedure, their role is primarily supervisory, with intervention limited to issuing abort commands in emergencies. Although initial development costs were substantial, the system's reliability and standardized components have yielded significant cost reductions for subsequent missions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Woffinden|first1=David C.|last2=Geller|first2=David K.|date=July 2007|title=Navigating the Road to Autonomous Orbital Rendezvous|journal=Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets|volume=44|issue=4|pages=898\u2013909|bibcode=2007JSpRo..44..898W|doi=10.2514/1.30734}}</ref>\n\nThe American [[SpaceX Dragon 2]] cargo and crewed spacecraft can autonomously rendezvous and dock with the station without human intervention.

These spacecraft are instructed to approach and park near the station. Once the crew on board the station is ready, the spacecraft is commanded to come close to the station, so that it can be grappled by an astronaut using the [[Mobile Servicing System]] robotic arm. The final mating of the spacecraft to the station is achieved using the robotic arm (a process known as berthing). Spacecraft using this semi-automated process include the American [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] and the Japanese [[HTV-X]]. The now-retired American [[SpaceX Dragon 1]], European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] and Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]] also used this process.\n\n==== Launch and docking windows ====\nPrior to a spacecraft's docking to the ISS, navigation and attitude control ([[Guidance, navigation, and control|GNC]]) is handed over to the ground control of the spacecraft's country of origin. GNC is set to allow the station to drift in space, rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes. The solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming spacecraft, so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells. Before its retirement, Shuttle launches were often given priority over Soyuz, with occasional priority given to Soyuz arrivals carrying crew and time-critical cargoes, such as biological experiment materials.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trinidad|first1=Katherine|last2=Thomas|first2=Candrea|date=22 May 2009|title=NASA's Space Shuttle Landing Delayed by Weather|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/may/HQ_09-118_Shuttle_Landing_Delayed.html|access-date=26 June 2015|publisher=NASA|archive-date=7 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307235001/http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/may/HQ_09-118_Shuttle_Landing_Delayed.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Repairs===\n{{Main|Maintenance of the International Space Station}}\n[[File:ISS Unpressurized Platforms.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Spare parts are called [[orbital replacement unit|ORUs]]; some are externally stored on pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier|ELCs]] and [[External stowage platform|ESPs]].]]\n[[File:STS-120 EVA Scott Parazynski.jpg|thumb|While anchored on the end of the [[Orbiter Boom Sensor System]] during [[STS-120]], astronaut [[Scott Parazynski]] performs makeshift repairs to a US solar array that was damaged during unfolding|alt=Two black and orange solar arrays, shown uneven and with a large tear visible.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s (ESPs) which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, Cygnus and Dragon, carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons.

But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging six months in duration. These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS. During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose the quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.<ref name=MMOP_SSP_50260 />{{rp|5.7.3}} During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards. The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS. The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[noise barrier]]s, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels, this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[ambient noise level]]s.\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members. The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits. One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[hearing protection device]]s (HPDs). Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions.\n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.<ref>{{cite web|year=2020|title=Safe in Sound Winners|url=https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200625051514/https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html|archive-date=25 June 2020|website=safeinsound.us}}</ref>\n\n====Fire and toxic gases====\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.

The FTCs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced fault-masking by majority voting.\n\n===Orientation===\n''Zvezda'' uses gyroscopes ([[reaction wheel]]s) and thrusters to turn itself. Gyroscopes do not require propellant; instead they use electricity to 'store' momentum in flywheels by turning in the opposite direction to the station's movement. The USOS has its own computer-controlled gyroscopes to handle its extra mass. When gyroscopes [[Control moment gyroscope#Saturation|'saturate']], thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum. In February 2005, during Expedition 10, an incorrect command was sent to the station's computer, using about 14&nbsp;kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed. When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, this can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which itself has no thrusters.<ref>{{cite web|date=7 October 2003|title=Russian / US GNC Force Fight|url=http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720193844/http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf|archive-date=20 July 2012|access-date=1 May 2012|website=pims.grc.nasa.gov|publisher=[[Glenn Research Center]]}}</ref><ref name=\"iss-report-05-07\">{{Cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2005/iss05-7.html|title=International Space Station Status Report #05-7|date=11 February 2005|publisher=[[NASA]]|access-date=23 November 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050317194246/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2005/iss05-7.html|archive-date=17 March 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"nasa-dynamics-report\">{{Cite tech report|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20030038806/downloads/20030038806.pdf|title=Dynamics and Control of Attitude, Power, and Momentum for a Spacecraft Using Flywheels and Control Moment Gyroscopes|last1=Roithmayr|first1=Carlos M.|last2=Karlgaard|first2=Christopher D.|last3=Kumar|first3=Renjith R.|last4=Seywald|first4=Hans|last5=Bose|first5=David M.|date=April 2003|publisher=[[NASA]]|location=Hampton, Virginia|id=TP-2003-212178|access-date=12 July 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230810132103/https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20030038806/downloads/20030038806.pdf|archive-date=10 August 2023}}</ref>\n\nDocked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude, such as for troubleshooting or during the [[STS-117|installation of the S3/S4 truss]], which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics.<ref name=\"nsf-20070614\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/06/atlantis-ready-to-support-iss-troubleshooting/|title=Atlantis ready to support ISS troubleshooting|last=Bergin|first=Chris|date=14 June 2007|access-date=6 March 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131051544/http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/06/atlantis-ready-to-support-iss-troubleshooting/|archive-date=31 January 2010|work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]]}}</ref>\n\n===Orbital debris threats===\n{{Main|Space debris}}\n\nThe low altitudes at which the ISS orbits are also home to a variety of space debris,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Michael|date=3 April 2009|title=National Space Symposium 2009: It's getting crowded up there|url=http://defensenews.com/blogs/space-symposium/2009/04/03/its-getting-crowded-up-there/#more-155|access-date=7 October 2009|publisher=Defense News}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> including spent rocket stages, defunct satellites, explosion fragments (including materials from [[anti-satellite weapon]] tests), paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, and coolant released by [[US-A]] nuclear-powered satellites.
