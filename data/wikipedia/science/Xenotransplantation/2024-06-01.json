The next waves of studies on the topic came with the discovery of [[immunosuppressive drug]]s.  Even more studies followed [[Joseph Murray]]'s first successful [[kidney transplantation|renal transplantation]] in 1954 and scientists, facing the ethical questions of organ donation for the first time, accelerated their effort in looking for alternatives to human organs.<ref name=History1995/>\n\n=== Non-human kidney to a human ===\nIn 1963, doctors at [[Tulane University]] attempted [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]-to-human renal transplantations in six people who were near death; after this and several subsequent unsuccessful attempts to use primates as organ donors and the development of a working cadaver organ procuring program, interest in xenotransplantation for kidney failure dissipated.<ref name=History1995/>   Out of 13 such transplants performed by [[Keith Reemtsma]], one kidney recipient lived for nine months, returning to work as a schoolteacher. At autopsy, the chimpanzee kidneys appeared normal and showed no signs of acute or chronic rejection.<ref name=\"Cooper\"/>\n\n=== Non-human heart to a human ===\nAn American infant girl known as \"[[Baby Fae]]\" with [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]] was the first infant recipient of a xenotransplantation, when she received a [[baboon]] heart in 1984. The procedure was performed by [[Leonard Lee Bailey]] at [[Loma Linda University Medical Center]] in [[Loma Linda, California]]. Fae died 21 days later due to a [[Humoral immunity|humoral-based]] [[graft rejection]] thought to be caused mainly by an ABO [[blood type]] mismatch, considered unavoidable due to the rarity of type O baboons. The graft was meant to be temporary, but unfortunately a suitable [[allograft]] replacement could not be found in time. While the procedure itself did not advance the progress on xenotransplantation, it did shed a light on the insufficient amount of organs for infants. The story made such an impact that the crisis of infant organ shortage improved for that time.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.1985.03360230053022 | last1 = Bailey | first1 = L.

[[Chimpanzee]]s were originally considered the best option since their organs are of similar size, and they have good blood type compatibility with humans, which makes them potential candidates for [[xenotransfusion]]s. However, since chimpanzees are listed as an [[endangered species]], other potential donors were sought. [[Baboon]]s are more readily available, but impractical as potential donors. Problems include their smaller body size, the infrequency of blood group O (the universal donor), their long gestation period, and their typically small number of offspring.

Xenozoonoses are one of the biggest threats to rejections, as they are xenogenetic infections. The introduction of these microorganisms are a big issue that lead to the fatal infections and then rejection of the organs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boneva |first1=RS |last2=Folks |first2=TM |last3=Chapman |first3=LE |title=Infectious disease issues in xenotransplantation. |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |date=January 2001 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201314 |doi=10.1128/CMR.14.1.1-14.2001 |pmid=11148000|pmc=88959 }}</ref> This response, which is generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and can in some cases result in the immediate death of the recipient. There are several types of rejection organ xenografts are faced with, these include hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection, cellular rejection, and chronic rejection.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nA rapid, violent, and hyperacute response comes as a result of [[antibodies]] present in the host organism. These antibodies are known as xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNAs).<ref name=Dooldeniya2003/>\n\n==== Hyperacute rejection ====\n\nThis rapid and violent type of rejection occurs within minutes to hours from the time of the transplant. It is mediated by the binding of XNAs (xenoreactive natural antibodies) to the donor endothelium, causing activation of the human [[complement system]], which results in endothelial damage, inflammation, thrombosis and necrosis of the transplant. XNAs are first produced and begin circulating in the blood in neonates, after colonization of the bowel by bacteria with galactose moieties on their cell walls. Most of these antibodies are the [[IgM]] class, but also include [[IgG]], and [[IgA]].<ref name=\"Taylor2007\"/>\n\nThe epitope XNAs target is an \u03b1-linked galactose moiety, [[galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose]] (also called the \u03b1-Gal epitope), produced by the enzyme alpha-[[galactosyltransferase]].<ref name=candinas2000>{{Cite journal | last1 = Candinas | first1 = D. | last2 = Adams | first2 = D.

In pig to primate xenotransplantation, XNAs recognize porcine glycoproteins of the integrin family.<ref name=\"Taylor2007\"/>\n\nThe binding of XNAs initiate complement activation through the [[classical complement pathway]]. Complement activation causes a cascade of events leading to: destruction of endothelial cells, platelet degranulation, inflammation, coagulation, fibrin deposition, and hemorrhage. The result is [[thrombosis]] and [[necrosis]] of the xenograft.<ref name=\"Taylor2007\"/>\n\n==== Overcoming hyperacute rejection ====\nSince hyperacute rejection presents such a barrier to the success of xenografts, several strategies to overcome it are under investigation:\n\n''Interruption of the complement cascade''\n* The recipient's complement cascade can be inhibited through the use of cobra venom factor (which depletes [[C3-convertase|C3]]), soluble complement receptor type 1, anti-[[Complement component 5|C5]] antibodies, or [[C1 inhibitor]] (C1-INH). Disadvantages of this approach include the toxicity of cobra venom factor, and most importantly these treatments would deprive the individual of a functional complement system.<ref name=\"Dooldeniya2003\"/>\n\n''Transgenic organs (Genetically engineered pigs)''\n* 1,3 galactosyl transferase gene knockouts \u2013 These pigs do not contain the gene that codes for the enzyme responsible for expression of the immunogeneic gal-\u03b1-1,3Gal moiety (the \u03b1-Gal epitope).<ref name=latemple>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3089.1998.tb00027.x | last1 = Latemple | first1 = D.

The process is much more complex than hyperacute rejection and is currently not completely understood. Acute vascular rejection requires de novo protein synthesis and is driven by interactions between the graft endothelial cells and host antibodies, macrophages, and platelets. The response is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of mostly [[macrophages]] and [[natural killer cells]] (with small numbers of [[T cells]]), intravascular thrombosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls.<ref name=\"candinas2000\"/>\n\nBinding of the previously mentioned XNAs to the donor endothelium leads to the activation of host macrophages as well as the endothelium itself. The endothelium activation is considered type II since gene induction and protein synthesis are involved. The binding of XNAs ultimately leads to the development of a procoagulant state, the secretion of inflammatory [[cytokines]] and [[chemokines]], as well as expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules such as [[E-selectin]], intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ([[ICAM-1]]), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ([[VCAM-1]]).<ref name=\"Taylor2007\"/>\n\nThis response is further perpetuated as normally binding between regulatory proteins and their ligands aid in the control of coagulation and inflammatory responses. However, due to molecular incompatibilities between the molecules of the donor species and recipient (such as porcine [[major histocompatibility complex]] molecules and human natural killer cells), this may not occur.<ref name=\"candinas2000\"/>\n\n==== Overcoming acute vascular rejection ====\nDue to its complexity,  the use of immunosuppressive drugs along with a wide array of approaches are necessary to prevent acute vascular rejection, and include administering a synthetic thrombin inhibitor to modulate thrombogenesis, depletion of anti-galactose antibodies (XNAs) by techniques such as immunoadsorption, to prevent endothelial cell activation, and inhibiting activation of macrophages (stimulated by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) and NK cells (stimulated by the release of Il-2). Thus, the role of MHC molecules and T cell responses in activation would have to be reassessed for each species combo.<ref name=\"candinas2000\"/>\n\n==== Accommodation ====\nIf hyperacute and acute vascular rejection are avoided accommodation is possible, which is the survival of the xenograft despite the presence of circulating XNAs. The graft is given a break from humoral rejection<ref name=takahashi>{{Cite journal | last1 = Takahashi | first1 = T. | last2 = Saadi | first2 = S. | last3 = Platt | first3 = J.

This allows the xenograft to up-regulate and express protective genes, which aid in resistance to injury, such as [[heme oxygenase-1]] (an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme).<ref name=\"Taylor2007\"/>\n\n==== Cellular rejection ====\nRejection of the xenograft in hyperacute and acute vascular rejection is due to the response of the [[humoral immune system]], since the response is elicited by the XNAs. Cellular rejection is based on [[cellular immunity]], and is mediated by natural killer cells that accumulate in and damage the xenograft and T-lymphocytes which are activated by MHC molecules through both direct and indirect xenorecognition.{{cn|date=December 2023}}\n\nIn direct xenorecognition, antigen presenting cells from the xenograft present peptides to recipient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells via xenogeneic MHC class II molecules, resulting in the production of [[interleukin 2]] (IL-2). Indirect xenorecognition involves the presentation of antigens from the xenograft by recipient antigen presenting cells to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Antigens of phagocytosed graft cells can also be presented by the host's class I MHC molecules to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.<ref name=Dooldeniya2003/><ref name=abbas2005>Abbas, A., Lichtman, A.

This leads to more antigens potentially recognized as foreign, thus eliciting a greater indirect xenogenic response.<ref name=\"Dooldeniya2003\"/>\n\n==== Overcoming cellular rejection ====\nA proposed strategy to avoid cellular rejection is to induce donor non-responsiveness using hematopoietic chimerism.<ref name=\"Sachs\">{{cite journal | journal=Xenotransplantation | date = May 2018 | volume=25 |issue=3 |page=e12420 | pmid= 29913045 | title=Transplantation Tolerance Through Mixed Chimerism: From Allo to Xeno | author=David H.

The bone marrow stem cells give rise to cells of all hematopoietic lineages, through the process of [[hematopoiesis]]. Lymphoid progenitor cells are created by this process and move to the thymus where negative selection eliminates T cells found to be reactive to self. The existence of donor stem cells in the recipient's bone marrow causes donor reactive T cells to be considered self and undergo [[apoptosis]].<ref name=\"Dooldeniya2003\"/>\n\n==== Chronic rejection ====\nChronic rejection is slow and progressive, and usually occurs in transplants that survive the initial rejection phases.<ref name=\"candinas2000\" /> Scientists are still unclear how chronic rejection exactly works, research in this area is difficult since xenografts rarely survive past the initial acute rejection phases. Nonetheless, it is known that XNAs and the complement system are not primarily involved.<ref name=\"candinas2000\"/> [[Fibrosis]] in the xenograft occurs as a result of immune reactions, cytokines (which stimulate fibroblasts), or healing (following cellular necrosis in acute rejection). Perhaps the major cause of chronic rejection is [[arteriosclerosis]]. Lymphocytes, which were previously activated by antigens in the vessel wall of the graft, activate macrophages to secrete smooth muscle growth factors. This results in a build up of smooth muscle cells on the vessel walls, causing the hardening and narrowing of vessels within the graft. Chronic rejection leads to pathologic changes of the organ, and is why transplants must be replaced after so many years.<ref name=\"abbas2005\"/> It is also anticipated that chronic rejection will be more aggressive in xenotransplants as opposed to allotransplants.<ref name=vanderpool>{{Cite journal | last1 = Vanderpool | first1 = H.

Due to this effect, porcine donors must be extensively screened before transplantation.

HIV is an example of a disease believed to have jumped from monkeys to humans. Researchers also do not know if an outbreak of infectious diseases could occur and if they could contain the outbreak even though they have measures for control. Another obstacle facing xenotransplants is that of the body's rejection of foreign objects by its immune system. These antigens (foreign objects) are often treated with powerful immunosuppressive drugs that could, in turn, make the patient vulnerable to other infections and actually aid the disease. This is the reason the organs would have to be altered to fit the patients' DNA ([[histocompatibility]]).{{cn|date=December 2023}}\n\nIn 2005, the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) declared an eighteen-year moratorium on all animal-to-human transplantation, concluding that the risks of transmission of animal viruses to patients and the wider community had not been resolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf |title=The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council's 2005 statement on xenotransplantation |access-date=2008-11-06 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080722120810/http://nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf |archive-date = 2008-07-22}}</ref>\nThis was repealed in 2009 after an NHMRC review stated \"... the risks, if appropriately regulated, are minimal and acceptable given the potential benefits.\", citing international developments on the management and regulation of xenotransplantation by the World Health Organisation and the European Medicines Agency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lifescientist.com.au/article/329402/xenotransplantation_ban_lifted_australia |title=Xenotransplantation ban lifted in Australia |work=Life Scientist|last=Dean |first=Tim |date=December 10, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215005407/http://www.lifescientist.com.au/article/329402/xenotransplantation_ban_lifted_australia |archive-date=2009-12-15 |access-date=May 21, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==== Porcine endogenous retroviruses ====\n{{Redirect|PERVS|other uses|Perv (disambiguation){{!}}Perv}}\n{{Further|Porcine endogenous retrovirus}}\n[[Endogenous retroviruses]] are remnants of ancient viral infections, found in the genomes of most, if not all, mammalian species.
