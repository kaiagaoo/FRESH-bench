Blue Origin moved into the [[orbital spaceflight]] technology [[new product development|development]] business in 2014, initially as a [[rocket engine]] supplier via a contractual agreement to build the BE-4 rocket engine, for major US launch system operator United Launch Alliance (ULA). ULA has said that the first flight of its Vulcan Centaur heavy-lift launch vehicle is scheduled to launch in Q3 of 2023. The heavy-lift launch vehicles main power is supported by two BE-4 engines. \n\nAfter initiating the development of an orbital rocket system prior to 2012, and stating in 2013 on their website that the first stage would perform a powered vertical landing and be reusable, Blue Origin publicly announced their orbital [[launch vehicle]] intentions in September 2015. In January 2016, Blue Origin indicated that the new rocket would be many times larger than New Shepard. Blue Origin publicly released the high-level design of the vehicle and announced its name in September 2016 as \"New Glenn\". The New Glenn heavy-lift launch vehicle can be configured in both [[Two-stage-to-orbit|two-stage]] and [[Three-stage-to-orbit|three-stage]] variants. New Glenn is planned to launch in Q3 of 2024.  \n\nOn July 20, 2021, the New Shepard performed its [[Blue Origin NS-16|first crewed mission]] into space. The flight lasted approximately 10 minutes and crossed the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]]. The passengers were [[Jeff Bezos]] , his brother [[Mark Bezos]], [[Wally Funk]], and [[Oliver Daemen]], after the unnamed auction winner (later revealed to have been [[Justin Sun]]) dropped out due to a scheduling conflict. The second and third crewed missions of New Shepard took place in October and December 2021. The Fourth crewed flight happened in March 2022. On June 4, 2022, New Shepard completed its [[Blue Origin NS-21|fifth crewed mission launch]] and the [[Blue Origin NS-22|sixth crewed flight]] took place on August 4, 2022. In September 2022, an [[Blue Origin NS-23|uncrewed mission of the New Shepard]] had an anomaly due to a failure of the BE-3 main engine. The launch escape system triggered and the capsule landed safely. The remaining New Shepard launch vehicles were grounded pending an FAA investigation into the incident. After a six-month investigation, Blue Origin pinpointed the cause of the anomaly as a thermal-structure failure of the BE-3 engine nozzle which caused a thrust misalignment that triggered the capsule's emergency escape system to activate. Blue Origin said in its press release that New Shepard flights would resume as soon as possible.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blue Origin NS-23 Findings |url=https://www.blueorigin.com/news/ns-23-findings |access-date=April 2, 2023 |website=Blue Origin |language=en-US}}</ref> New Shepard performed six crewed flights between July 2021 and August 2022, taking a mix of sponsored celebrities such as [[Wally Funk]], [[William Shatner]] as well as paying customers.

The vehicle is named after [[Alan Shepard]], the first American astronaut in space. The vehicle is capable of [[VTVL|vertical takeoff and landings]] and can carry humans and customer payloads to the edge of space. \n\nThe New Shepard launch vehicle is one-stage and consists of a [[Booster (rocketry)|booster rocket]] and a crew capsule. The capsule can seat six passengers. The booster rocket is powered by a 1-[[BE-3]] engine, which sends the capsule to an altitude of over 100 km and flies above the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]] where passengers can experience a few minutes of [[weightlessness]] before the capsule returns to Earth. \n\nThe launch vehicle is designed to be fully reusable, with the capsule returning to Earth via [[parachute]] and the booster landing vertically on the same launchpad it took off from. New Shepard allows Blue Origin to significantly reduce the cost of space tourism, making the experience more accessible to the general public. Blue Origin has successfully launched and landed the New Shepard launch vehicle 22 times.\n\n=== New Glenn ===\n{{main|New Glenn}}\n[[File:NewGlennR.jpg|thumb|280x280px|[[New Glenn]] heavy-lift rocket, Illustration of atmospheric trajectory ]]\nNew Glenn is a [[Heavy-lift launch vehicle|heavy-lift]] [[launch vehicle]] in development stage, and is expected to be ready for Launch in Q3 of 2024.

Illustrations of the vehicle, and the high-level specifications, were initially publicly unveiled in September 2016. The rocket will have a diameter of 7 meters (23ft), and its first stage will be powered by seven [[BE-4]] engines.

Since 2016, Blue Origin converted [[Spaceport Florida Launch Complex 36|Launch Complex 36]] (LC-36) to launch its [[New Glenn]] to orbit<ref name=\"S-BG-2016\">[http://www.space.com/33293-blue-origin-construction-florida-rocket-factory.html Blue Origin's Rocket Factory Breaks Ground, June 2016], accessed Feb 2022</ref> at the [[Cape Canaveral Space Force Station]].\n\nBlue Origin's New Shepard launch site is located 30 miles north of Van Horn, Texas. The facility also test fires the companies engines. Engine production is located in Huntsville, Alabama, at a 600,000sqft facility at a facility called, \"Blue Engine\". The Blue Origin website states that, ''\"The world-class engine manufacturing facility in The Rocket City will conduct high rate production of the BE-4 and BE-3U engines. These engines will undergo testing at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center on the historic Test Stand 4670. BE-7, [is the] lunar landing engine, [which] is also currently in test at NASA Marshall.\"''  Blue Engine has over 1000 employees and works 24/7.\n\n== Other projects ==\n\n=== Orbital Reef (commercial space station) ===\nBlue Origin and its partners [[Sierra Space]], [[Boeing]], [[Redwire Space]] and Genesis Engineering Solutions won a $130{{nbsp}}million award to jump-start the design of their Orbital Reef commercial space station. The project is envisioned as an expandable business park, with Boeing's [[Boeing Starliner|Starliner]] and Sierra Space's [[Dream Chaser]] transporting passengers to and from low Earth orbit for tourism, research and in-space manufacturing projects.\n\n=== Project Kuiper ===\n{{main|Kuiper Systems}}\nProject Kuiper is the name for Amazon's satellite project. The company plans to build a network of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) to provide high-speed internet around the world. The technology giant signed launch contracts with three companies for what it claims is the biggest rocket deal in commercial space history.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sheetz |first=Michael |title=Amazon signs massive rocket deal with 3 firms, including Bezos' Blue Origin, to launch internet satellites |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/05/amazon-signs-rocket-deal-with-blue-origin-arianespace-ula-for-project-kuiper-internet-satellites.html |access-date=April 4, 2023 |website=CNBC |language=en}}</ref> Blue Origin received a contract for 12 launches with an option for 15 more. Amazon's Kuiper contracts are estimated to be worth billions of dollars and Blue Origin is expected to receive more contracts once its New Glenn heavy-lift launch vehicle becomes available.\n\n=== Nuclear rocket program ===\nNASA plans to test spacecraft, engines and other propellent systems powered by nuclear fission no later than 2027 as part of the agency's effort to demonstrate more efficient methods of traveling through outer space for space exploration.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Roulette |first=Joey |date=January 25, 2023 |title=U.S. to test nuclear-powered spacecraft by 2027 |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/us-test-nuclear-powered-spacecraft-by-2027-2023-01-24/ |access-date=April 7, 2023}}</ref> One benefit to using nuclear fission as a propellent for spacecraft is that nuclear-based systems can have less mass than solar cells which means a spacecraft could be much smaller while absorbing and using the same amount of energy more efficiently. Nuclear fission concepts that can power both life support and propulsion systems could greatly reduce the cost and flight time during space exploration.\n\nThe [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] awarded [[General Atomics]], Lockheed Martin and Blue Origin contracts to fund and build nuclear spacecraft under the agency's Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations program or DRACO program.
