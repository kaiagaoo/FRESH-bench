This integration allows for a more holistic understanding of complex data, improving model performance in tasks like visual question answering, cross-modal retrieval,<ref>{{Cite arXiv |last1=Hendriksen |first1=Mariya |last2=Bleeker |first2=Maurits |last3=Vakulenko |first3=Svitlana |last4=van Noord |first4=Nanne |last5=Kuiper |first5=Ernst |last6=de Rijke |first6=Maarten |date=2021 |title=Extending CLIP for Category-to-image Retrieval in E-commerce |class=cs.CV |eprint=2112.11294}}</ref> text-to-image generation,<ref name=\"stable-diffusion-github\">{{cite web |date=17 September 2022 |title=Stable Diffusion Repository on GitHub |url=https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230118183342/https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion |archive-date=January 18, 2023 |access-date=17 September 2022 |publisher=CompVis - Machine Vision and Learning Research Group, LMU Munich}}</ref> aesthetic ranking,<ref>{{Citation |title=LAION-AI/aesthetic-predictor |date=2024-09-06 |url=https://github.com/LAION-AI/aesthetic-predictor |access-date=2024-09-08 |publisher=LAION AI}}</ref> and image captioning.<ref>{{Cite arXiv |last1=Mokady |first1=Ron |last2=Hertz |first2=Amir |last3=Bermano |first3=Amit H. |date=2021 |title=ClipCap: CLIP Prefix for Image Captioning |class=cs.CV |eprint=2111.09734}}</ref>\n\nLarge multimodal models, such as [[Google Gemini]] and [[GPT-4o]], have become increasingly popular since 2023, enabling increased versatility and a broader understanding of real-world phenomena.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zia |first=Tehseen |date=January 8, 2024 |title=Unveiling of Large Multimodal Models: Shaping the Landscape of Language Models in 2024 |url=https://www.unite.ai/unveiling-of-large-multimodal-models-shaping-the-landscape-of-language-models-in-2024/ |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=Unite.ai}}</ref>\n\n==Motivation==\nData usually comes with different modalities which carry different information. For example, it is very common to caption an image to convey the information not presented in the image itself. Similarly, sometimes it is more straightforward to use an image to describe information which may not be obvious from text. As a result, if different words appear in similar images, then these words likely describe the same thing. Conversely, if a word is used to describe seemingly dissimilar images, then these images may represent the same object. Thus, in cases dealing with multi-modal data, it is important to use a model which is able to jointly represent the information such that the model can capture the combined information from different modalities.\n\n== Multimodal transformers ==\n{{excerpt|Transformer (machine learning model)|Multimodality}}\n\n=== Multimodal large language models ===\n{{excerpt|Large language model|Multimodality}}\n== Multimodal deep Boltzmann machines ==\nA [[Boltzmann machine]] is a type of [[stochastic neural network]] invented by [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and [[Terry Sejnowski]] in 1985. Boltzmann machines can be seen as the [[stochastic process|stochastic]], [[generative model|generative]] counterpart of [[Hopfield net]]s. They are named after the [[Boltzmann distribution]] in statistical mechanics. The units in Boltzmann machines are divided into two groups: visible units and hidden units. Each unit is like a neuron with a binary output that represents whether it is activated or not.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dey |first=Victor |date=2021-09-03 |title=Beginners Guide to Boltzmann Machine |url=https://analyticsindiamag.com/beginners-guide-to-boltzmann-machines/ |access-date=2024-03-02 |website=Analytics India Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref> General Boltzmann machines allow connection between any units. However, learning is impractical using general Boltzmann Machines because the computational time is exponential to the size of the machine{{Citation needed|date=November 2022}}. A more efficient architecture is called [[restricted Boltzmann machine]] where connection is only allowed between hidden unit and visible unit, which is described in the next section.\n\nMultimodal deep Boltzmann machines can process and learn from different types of information, such as images and text, simultaneously. This can notably be done by having a separate deep Boltzmann machine for each modality, for example one for images and one for text, joined at an additional top hidden layer.<ref>{{cite web |year=2014 |title=Multimodal Learning with Deep Boltzmann Machine |url=http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14b/srivastava14b.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621055730/http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14b/srivastava14b.pdf |archive-date=2015-06-21 |access-date=2015-06-14}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\nMultimodal machine learning has numerous applications across various domains:\n\n=== Cross-Modal Retrieval ===\nCross-modal retrieval allows users to search for data across different modalities (e.g., retrieving images based on text descriptions), improving multimedia search engines and content recommendation systems.
