They mimic the actions of the endogenous [[incretin]] hormone [[GLP-1]], which is released by the gut after eating. \n\nGLP-1 agonists were initially developed for [[type 2 diabetes]]. The 2022 [[American Diabetes Association]] standards of medical care recommend GLP-1 agonists as a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes, specifically in patients with [[atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease]] or [[obesity]]. The drugs were also noted to reduce food intake and body weight significantly, and some have been approved to treat obesity in the absence of diabetes. They are also in development for other indications, such as [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]], [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], and diseases of the [[reward system]] such as [[addiction]]s.\n\n==Mechanism of action==\nGLP-1 agonists work by activating the [[GLP-1 receptor]]. They slow [[gastric emptying]], inhibit the release of [[glucagon]], and stimulate [[insulin]] production, therefore reducing [[hyperglycemia]] in people with [[type 2 diabetes]].
