[[NASA]] began work on a [[Grand Tour program|Grand Tour]], which evolved into a massive project involving two groups of two probes each, with one group visiting Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto and the other Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. The spacecraft would be designed with redundant systems to ensure survival through the entire tour. By 1972 the mission was scaled back and replaced with two [[Mariner program]]-derived spacecraft, the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. To keep apparent lifetime program costs low, the mission would include only flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, but keep the Grand Tour option open.<ref name=ESBS/>{{rp|263}} As the program progressed, the name was changed to Voyager.<ref>[https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/planetary.html Planetary Voyage] [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] \u2013 California Institute of Technology. March 23, 2004. Retrieved April 8, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe primary mission of ''Voyager 1'' was to explore Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. ''Voyager 2'' was also to explore Jupiter and Saturn, but on a trajectory that would have the option of continuing on to Uranus and Neptune, or being redirected to Titan as a backup for ''Voyager 1''. Upon successful completion of ''Voyager 1''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s objectives, ''Voyager 2'' would get a mission extension to send the probe on towards Uranus and Neptune.<ref name=ESBS>{{cite book |last1=Butrica |first1=Andrew |title=From Engineering Science to Big Science |page=267 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter11.html |access-date=September 4, 2015 |quote=Despite the name change, Voyager remained in many ways the Grand Tour concept, though certainly not the Grand Tour (TOPS) spacecraft. ''Voyager 2'' was launched on August 20, 1977, followed by ''Voyager 1'' on September 5, 1977. The decision to reverse the order of launch had to do with keeping open the possibility of carrying out the Grand Tour mission to Uranus, Neptune, and beyond. ''Voyager 2'', if boosted by the maximum performance from the Titan-Centaur, could just barely catch the old Grand Tour trajectory and encounter Uranus. Two weeks later, ''Voyager 1'' would leave on an easier and much faster trajectory, visiting Jupiter and Saturn only. ''Voyager 1'' would arrive at Jupiter four months ahead of Voyager 2, then arrive at Saturn nine months earlier. Hence, the second spacecraft launched was ''Voyager 1'', not ''Voyager 2''. The two Voyagers would arrive at Saturn nine months apart, so that if ''Voyager 1'' failed to achieve its Saturn objectives, for whatever reason, ''Voyager 2'' still could be retargeted to achieve them, though at the expense of any subsequent Uranus or Neptune encounter.}}</ref>\n\n===Spacecraft design===\nConstructed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), ''Voyager 2'' included 16 [[hydrazine]] thrusters, [[three-axis stabilization]], [[gyroscopes]] and celestial referencing instruments (Sun sensor/[[Canopus]] Star Tracker) to maintain pointing of the [[high-gain antenna]] toward Earth. Collectively these instruments are part of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects as it traveled through space.<ref name=\"PDS-Host\">{{cite web |url=https://starbrite.jpl.nasa.gov/ds-view/pds/viewHostProfile.jsp?INSTRUMENT_HOST_ID=VG2 |title=Voyager 2: Host Information |date=1989 |publisher=NASA |access-date=January 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220172046/https://starbrite.jpl.nasa.gov/ds-view/pds/viewHostProfile.jsp?INSTRUMENT_HOST_ID=VG2 |archive-date=February 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Communications====\nBuilt with the intent for eventual interstellar travel, ''Voyager 2'' included a large, {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} parabolic, [[high-gain antenna]] ([[:File:Voyager Program - High-gain antenna diagram.png|see diagram]]) to transceive data via the [[Deep Space Network]] on [[the Earth]]. Communications are conducted over the [[S-band]] (about 13&nbsp;cm wavelength) and [[X-band]] (about 3.6&nbsp;cm wavelength) providing data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second at the distance of Jupiter, and then ever-decreasing as distance increases, because of the [[inverse-square law]].

Each RTG includes 24 pressed plutonium oxide spheres, and provided enough heat to generate approximately 157 W of electrical power at launch. Collectively, the RTGs supplied the spacecraft with 470 watts at launch (halving every 87.7 years). They were predicted to allow operations to continue until at least 2020, and continued to provide power to five scientific instruments through the early part of 2023. In April 2023 JPL began using a reservoir of backup power intended for an onboard safety mechanism. As a result, all five instruments are expected to continue operation through 2026.<ref name=\"PDS-Host\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Voyager 2 Craft Details |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1977-076A |website=NASA-NSSDC-Spacecraft-Details |publisher=NASA |access-date=March 9, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"NuclearNews\">{{cite journal |last1=Furlong |first1=Richard R. |last2=Wahlquist |first2=Earl J. |date=1999 |title=U.S. space missions using radioisotope power systems |journal=Nuclear News |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=26\u201334 |url=http://www2.ans.org/pubs/magazines/nn/pdfs/1999-4-2.pdf |access-date=January 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=NASA's Voyager Will Do More Science With New Power Strategy |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-voyager-will-do-more-science-with-new-power-strategy |website=Jet-Propulsion-Laboratory |access-date=April 28, 2023}}</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"170px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Voyager Program - RTG diagram 1.png|RTG inner heat source\nFile:Voyager Program - RTG diagram 2.png|RTG assembly\nFile:Voyager Program - RTG upclose.png|RTG unit\n</gallery>\n\n====Attitude control and propulsion====\nBecause of the energy required to achieve a Jupiter trajectory boost with an {{convert|825|kg|lb|adj=on}} payload, the spacecraft included a propulsion module made of a {{convert|1123|kg|lb|adj=on}} solid-rocket motor and eight hydrazine [[monopropellant rocket]] engines, four providing pitch and yaw attitude control, and four for roll control.

The backup receiver was functional, but a failed capacitor in the receiver meant that it could only receive transmissions that were sent at a precise frequency, and this frequency would be affected by the Earth's rotation (due to the [[Doppler effect]]) and the onboard receiver's temperature, among other things.<ref name=\"New-Scientist_January-31-1985\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Planets Beyond: Discovering the Outer Solar System |last=Littmann |first=Mark |year=2004 |publisher=[[Courier Corporation]] |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoJMadct4TQC&pg=PA106 |isbn=978-0-486-43602-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Voyage to the tilted planet |last=Davies |first=John |date=January 23, 1986 |page=42 |magazine=New Scientist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYIJJP7audkC&pg=PA42}}</ref> For each subsequent transmission to ''Voyager 2'', it was necessary for engineers to calculate the specific frequency for the signal so that it could be received by the spacecraft.\n<!--too editorial, complete rewrite necessary\n\n===Complications===\nSome weeks later, the ground controllers for the Voyager program became engrossed in an early post-launch problem with Voyager 1, and they forgot to send an important updating code to ''Voyager 2''. (These space probes had been programmed to expect a radio message of some kind from the [[Deep Space Network]] at least once per week to verify that their radio systems were still working.) This failure to receive a radio message caused ''Voyager 2'' to shut down its primary radio receiver, and to switch over to its identical back-up receiver, which had a subtle defect in it. In the process of switching back and forth between the receivers a few times, a fuse in the DC power supply of the primary receiver blew, permanently disabling it. Thus the back-up receiver had to be relied upon for the entire mission.\n\nFortunately, after waiting one more week, ''Voyager 2'' automatically switched to its back-up radio receiver once more, and the Deep Space Network radio engineers were able to re-establish contact through the spacecraft's back-up radio receiver. This radio receiver has remained somewhat \"finicky\" ever since then, but it has been \"nursemaided\" along technically, and it has never failed. Also, periodically, files of procedures for Voyager 2 to follow in the future have been uploaded via the Deep Space Network to give Voyager 2' a sketchy plan of what to do for many months, in case the radio receiver ever did permanently fail, cutting off all messages from the Earth to ''Voyager 2''.\n\nHowever, the back-up radio receiver for ''Voyager 2'' has not failed, and it remains in operation as of November 28, 2009. There has never been a problem with the two radio receivers for Voyager 1, or any problem with the X-band [[traveling wave tube]] transmitters for either ''Voyager 1'' or ''Voyager 2''.\n\n''Voyager 2''{{'}}s gyroscopes and its computer were operational during its Titan/Centaur launch phase, monitoring the sequence of events, in order for those systems to take over the space probe's [[Attitude dynamics and control|attitude control]] and other functions upon separation from the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stage. But at that point, the unexpected happened: ''Voyager 2'{{'}}s computer experienced robotic \"vertigo\". In its confusion, it helplessly switched to backup sensors, presuming its \"senses\" to be defective.\n\n''Voyager 2''{{'}}s disoriented flight-control computer remained disconnected from Voyager's powerful thrusters at this point, so it did not cause damage to the launch during the launching itself. The Centaur's attitude-control system stayed in charge, suffering no \"vertigo\" and, as planned, it electronically corrected the disequilibrium of the Voyager's computer just before separation.\n\nFrom the spacecraft's control center, engineers and technicians helplessly watched the antics of ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s disoriented computer. One hour and 11 minutes after lift-off, ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s own dedicated solid rocket fired for 45 seconds, to supply the final increment of [[momentum]] that it needed to get to Jupiter.\n\nOne-and-one-half minutes after ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s key rocket burn ended, the three-meter-long articulating arm holding the television camera and other remote-sensing instruments unlatched and deployed as planned. After this, ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s computer once again sensed an emergency for some reason. This time it switched to a different set of thrusters and activated valves to control the tiny bursts of gas that stabilized its attitude in space. ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s robotic \"alter ego\" (its executive program) then challenged portions of its own computer in a frantic attempt to correct the orientation failure that it sensed.\n\nAt this point, ''Voyager 2'' followed the normal procedures that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers had installed in the computer to cope with the most dreaded emergency for a robot spacecraft in deep space{{snd}}attitude-control disorientation. Voyager 2 shut down most communications with the Earth in order to begin its reorientation.\n\nSeventy-nine minutes passed until ''Voyager 2'' found the Sun with a light sensor and to establish a known orientation point. ''Voyager 2'' then radioed back to Earth that it was operating normally. It was unknown at this point if the redundant sensors were malfunctioning, or if its on-board digital computer was defective.\n\nThe fault protection in ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s computer was operating at this point on the now-painful assumption that it would be triggered only by a hardware failure hundreds of millions of miles from Earth. In that event, Voyager 2 would be unable to establish even emergency communications with its human flight controllers, who could not help it much at that distance, in any case.\n\n''Voyager 2'' had been programmed to virtually shut off communications with the Earth during such deep-space emergencies and to attempt to fix itself. Somehow, these procedures had been triggered right after the launching, when they should not have been. There had been no hardware problems in the computer{{snd}}just a slight but serious mis-setting of attitude-control parameters in the on-board computer.\n-->\n\n===Encounter with Jupiter===\n{{main|Exploration of Jupiter}}\n[[File:Animation of Voyager 2's trajectory around Jupiter.gif|thumb|Animation of ''Voyager 2''{{'}}s trajectory around Jupiter<br>{{legend2| Magenta |''Voyager 2''}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2| RoyalBlue |Jupiter}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Lime|Io}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Cyan|Europa}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Gold|Ganymede}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|OrangeRed|Callisto}}]]\n[[File:Voyager-2 Jupiter-flyby July-10-1979.png|thumb|The trajectory of ''Voyager 2'' through the Jovian system]]\n''Voyager 2''{{'}}s closest approach to Jupiter occurred at 22:29 UT on July 9, 1979.<ref name=NASAVoyager2/> It came within {{convert|570,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the planet's cloud tops.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/history/70s/Voyager2_1979.htm |title=History |website=www.jpl.nasa.gov |access-date=October 5, 2018 |archive-date=April 16, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220416064548/https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/history/70s/Voyager2_1979.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nJupiter's [[Great Red Spot]] was revealed as a complex storm moving in a counterclockwise direction.
