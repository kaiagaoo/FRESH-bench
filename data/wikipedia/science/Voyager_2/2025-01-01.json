[[NASA]] began work on a [[Grand Tour program|Grand Tour]], which evolved into a massive project involving two groups of two probes each, with one group visiting Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto and the other Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. The spacecraft would be designed with redundant systems to ensure survival throughout the entire tour. By 1972 the mission was scaled back and replaced with two [[Mariner program]]-derived spacecraft, the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. To keep apparent lifetime program costs low, the mission would include only flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, but keep the Grand Tour option open.<ref name=\"butrica\" />{{rp|263}} As the program progressed, the name was changed to Voyager.<ref>[https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/planetary.html Planetary Voyage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826105129/http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/planetary.html |date=August 26, 2013 }} [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] \u2013 California Institute of Technology.

Collectively, the RTGs supplied the spacecraft with 470 watts at launch (halving every 87.7 years). They were predicted to allow operations to continue until at least 2020, and continued to provide power to five scientific instruments through the early part of 2023.
