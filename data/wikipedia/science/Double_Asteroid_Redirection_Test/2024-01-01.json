Following the impact, the instantaneous orbital speed of Dimorphos therefore dropped slightly, which reduced the radius of its orbit around Didymos. The trajectory of Didymos was also modified, but in inverse proportion to the ratio of its mass to the much lower mass of Dimorphos. The actual velocity change and orbital shift depended on the topography and composition of the surface, among other things. The contribution of the recoil [[momentum]] from the impact [[ejecta]] produces a poorly predictable \"momentum enhancement\" effect.<ref>{{Citation |title=WATCH: NASA Asteroid Redirection Test Media Briefing \u2013 Livestream |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMwB0QERjEw |language=en |access-date=20 May 2022}}</ref> Before the impact, the momentum transferred by DART to the largest remaining fragment of the asteroid was estimated as up to 3\u20135 times the incident momentum, depending on how much and how fast material would be ejected from the impact crater.

Some of the ejecta may eventually hit Didymos's surface. If the kinetic energy delivered to its surface was high enough, reshaping may have also occur in Didymos, given its near-rotational-breakup spin rate. Reshaping on either body would have modified their mutual gravitational field, leading to a reshaping-induced orbital period change, in addition to the impact-induced orbital period change. If left unaccounted for, this could later have led to an erroneous interpretation of the effect of the kinetic deflection technique.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Nakano |first1=Ryota |last2=Hirabayashi |first2=Masatoshi |last3=Agrusa |first3=Harrison F. |last4=Ferrari |first4=Fabio |last5=Meyer |first5=Alex J. |last6=Michel |first6=Patrick |last7=Raducan |first7=Sabina D. |last8=S\u00e1nchez |first8=Paul |last9=Zhang |first9=Yun |date=5 July 2022 |title=NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART): Mutual Orbital Period Change Due to Reshaping in the Near-Earth Binary Asteroid System (65803) Didymos |journal=The Planetary Science Journal |language=en |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=148 |doi=10.3847/PSJ/ac7566 |bibcode=2022PSJ.....3..148N |s2cid=250327233 |issn=2632-3338|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n===Observations of the impact===\n[[File:Telescopes observing DART's impact.png|thumb|Telescopes observing DART's impact]]\n[[File:Aftermath of DART Collision with Dimorphos Captured by SOAR Telescope (noirlab2223a).jpg|thumb|[[Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope|SOAR telescope]] shows the vast plume of dust and debris blasted from the surface of the asteroid Dimorphos]]\nDART's companion LICIACube,<ref>[https://twitter.com/LICIACube LICIACube Twitter feed]</ref><ref name=LICIACuberef>{{cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/liciacube-images-dart-asteroid-impact-1849585958 |title=First Asteroid Impact Images from DART's Companion Show Tentacle-Like Debris Plume|author=George Dvorsky|date=September 27, 2022|publisher=Gizmodo}}</ref> the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], [[James Webb Space Telescope]], and the Earth-based [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System|ATLAS observatory]] all detected the ejecta plume from the DART impact.<ref>[https://twitter.com/fallingstarIfA ATLAS twitter feed]</ref><ref name=atlasref>{{cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/telescopes-capture-dart-asteroid-impact-1849585394|title=Ground Telescopes Capture Jaw-Dropping Views of DART Asteroid Impact|\nquote=Telescopes around the world honed in on the historic collision, revealing a surprisingly large and bright impact plume.|author=George Dvorsky|date=September 27, 2022|publisher=Gizmodo}}</ref> On September 26, [[Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope|SOAR]] observed the visible impact trail to be over 10,000 km long.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Strickland |first1=Ashley |title=Comet-like debris trail spotted after spacecraft crashes into asteroid |url=https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/world/nasa-dart-debris-trail-scn/index.html |access-date=6 October 2022 |work=CNN |date=4 October 2022 |language=en}}</ref> Initial estimates of the change in binary orbit period were expected within a week and with the data released by LICIACube.<ref>{{Cite web |title=DART: Asteroid \u2013 eoPortal Directory \u2013 Satellite Missions |url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/d/dart-asteroid |access-date=24 November 2021 |website=directory.eoportal.org}}</ref> DART's mission science depends on careful Earth-based monitoring of the orbit of Dimorphos over the subsequent days and months. Dimorphos was too small and too close to Didymos for almost any observer to see directly, but its orbital geometry is such that it transits Didymos once each orbit and then passes behind it half an orbit later. Any observer that can detect the Didymos system therefore sees the system dim and brighten again as the two bodies cross. \n\nThe impact was planned for a moment when the distance between Didymos and Earth is at a minimum, permitting many telescopes to make observations from many locations. The asteroid was near opposition and visible high in the night sky well into 2023.<ref name=\"Lakwadalla-DART\"/> The change in Dimorphos's orbit around Didymos was detected by [[optical telescope]]s watching mutual [[eclipse]]s of the two bodies through [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] on the Dimorphos-Didymos pair. In addition to radar observations, they confirmed that the impact shortened Dimorphos' orbital period by 32 minutes.<ref name=\"DartUpdateNASA\">{{cite web |last1=Nelson |first1=Bill |last2=Saccoccia |first2=Giorgio |title=Update on DART Mission to Asteroid Dimorphos (NASA News Conference) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhzn0U2m5wQ |website=YouTube |access-date=11 October 2022 |language=en}}</ref> Based on the shortened binary orbital period, the instantaneous reduction in Dimorphos' velocity component along its orbital track was determined, which indicated that substantially more momentum was transferred to Dimorphos from the escaping impact ejecta than from the impact itself.

In such a scenario, DART would use its low-thrust, high-[[specific impulse|efficiency]] [[NEXT (ion thruster)|NEXT ion engine]] to slowly escape from its high Earth orbit to a slightly inclined near-Earth solar orbit, from which it would maneuver onto a collision trajectory with its target. But because DART was launched as a dedicated [[Falcon 9]] mission, the payload along with Falcon 9's second stage was placed directly on an Earth escape trajectory and into [[heliocentric orbit]] when the second stage reignited for a second engine startup or escape burn. Thus, although DART carries a first-of-its-kind electric thruster and plenty of xenon fuel, Falcon 9 did almost all of the work, leaving the spacecraft to perform only a few trajectory-correction burns with simple chemical thrusters as it homed in on Didymos's moon Dimorphos.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Atchison |first1=Justin A. |last2=Ozimek |first2=Martin T. |last3=Kantsiper |first3=Brian L. |last4=Cheng |first4=Andrew F. |date=1 June 2016 |title=Trajectory options for the DART mission |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576515303040 |journal=Acta Astronautica |series=Special Section: Selected Papers from the International Workshop on Satellite Constellations and Formation Flying 2015 |volume=123 |pages=330\u2013339 |bibcode=2016AcAau.123..330A |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2016.03.032 |issn=0094-5765}}</ref>\n\n===Transit===\n[[File:Animation of DART trajectory around Sun.gif|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Animation of DART's trajectory<br />{{legend2|magenta|DART}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|lime|[[65803 Didymos]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Royalblue|Earth}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|yellow|[[Sun]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|cyan|{{mpl|2001 CB|21}}}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|gold|[[3361 Orpheus]]}}]]\n\nThe transit phase before impact lasted about 9 months.

This means one could use either a smaller impactor or shorter lead times for the same deflection. The value of beta depends on various factors, composition, density, porosity, etc. The goal is to use these results and modeling to infer what beta could be for another asteroid by observing its surface and possibly measuring its bulk density. Scientists estimate that DART\u2019s impact displaced over {{cvt|1000000|kg}} of dusty ejecta into space \u2013 enough to fill six or seven [[Railcar|rail cars]].

This large change indicates the recoil from material excavated from the asteroid and ejected into space by the impact (known as ejecta) contributed significant momentum change to the asteroid, beyond that of the DART spacecraft itself. Researchers found the impact caused an instantaneous slowing in Dimorphos' speed along its orbit of about 2.7 millimeters per second \u2014 again indicating the recoil from ejecta played a major role in amplifying the momentum change directly imparted to the asteroid by the spacecraft. That momentum change was amplified by a factor of 2.2 to 4.9 (depending on the mass of Dimorphos), indicating the momentum change transferred because of ejecta production significantly exceeded the momentum change from the DART spacecraft alone.<ref name=\"nasa-march2023\">{{cite web |last1=Furfaro |first1=Emily |title=NASA's DART Data Validates Kinetic Impact as Planetary Defense Method |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-dart-data-validates-kinetic-impact-as-planetary-defense-method |website=NASA |access-date=9 March 2023 |date=28 February 2023}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> While the orbital change was small, the change is in the velocity and over the course of years will accumulate to a large change in position.<ref>{{Cite web |title=NASA Pushes Through With Asteroid Deflection Mission That Could One Day Save Earth \u2013 Inquisitr |url=https://www.inquisitr.com/4346664/nasa-dart-asteroid-deflection-mission-save-earth-goes-into-design-phase/ |access-date=27 September 2022 |website=inquisitr.com|date=5 July 2017 }}</ref> For a hypothetical Earth-threatening body, even such a tiny change could be sufficient to mitigate or prevent an impact, if applied early enough.
