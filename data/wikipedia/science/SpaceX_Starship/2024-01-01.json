It is the heaviest, tallest and most powerful space launch vehicle to have flown into space.{{Efn|See [[Comparison of orbital launch systems]] for more information}} Starship is intended to be [[Fully-reusable orbital launch vehicle|fully reusable]], which means both stages will be recovered after a mission and reused.\n\nThe Starship space vehicle is designed to supplant SpaceX's [[Falcon 9]] and [[Falcon Heavy]] rockets, expand SpaceX's [[Starlink]] satellite constellation, and launch crews to both low Earth orbit and Mars. SpaceX plans to use Starship vehicles as tankers, refueling other Starships to allow missions to [[geosynchronous orbit]], the [[Moon]], and [[Mars]]. A [[Starship HLS|lunar lander variant]] of Starship is to land [[astronaut]]s on the Moon as part of [[NASA]]'s [[Artemis program]]. Starship is primarily meant to enable [[SpaceX ambition of colonizing Mars|SpaceX's ambition of colonizing Mars]].\n\nStarship consists of the [[SpaceX Super Heavy|Super Heavy booster]] and the [[SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)|Starship spacecraft]]. The booster and spacecraft are both powered by [[SpaceX Raptor|Raptor]] engines, which burn liquid [[methane]] and [[liquid oxygen]]. Both stages are constructed primarily of stainless steel, a material chosen as an alternative to a series of [[SpaceX Starship design process|prior designs]]. The booster is designed to use its engines to [[Retrorocket#Reusable launch systems|slow itself down]] before it is caught by a pair of mechanical arms attached to the launch tower. The Starship spacecraft is protected during [[atmospheric reentry]] by its [[thermal protection system]], using a 'belly flop' maneuver where the spacecraft turns from a horizontal into a vertical position, then lands using its engines.\n\nThe Starship system aims to achieve frequent space launches at low cost. Development follows an [[Iterative and incremental development|iterative and incremental approach]] involving frequent, and often [[Destructive testing|destructive]], [[SpaceX Starship flight tests|test flights of prototype vehicles]].<ref>{{Cite web |author1=Wall |first=Mike |date=2023-04-21 |title=What's next for SpaceX's Starship after its historic flight test? |url=https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-flight-test-whats-next |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230427073926/https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-flight-test-whats-next |archive-date=27 April 2023 |access-date=2023-04-26 |website=[[Space.com]] |language=en}}</ref> The [[SpaceX Starship first integrated flight test|first flight test]] of the full Starship system took place on 20 April 2023, successfully lifting-off with several engines out, but ended four minutes after launch with a loss of control<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-04-21 |title=SpaceX rocket explosion illustrates Elon Musk's 'successful failure' formula |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/spacex-rocket-explosion-illustrates-elon-musk-s-successful-failure-formula-1.6365313 |access-date=2023-12-27 |website=CTVNews |language=en}}</ref> and destruction of the launch vehicle.
