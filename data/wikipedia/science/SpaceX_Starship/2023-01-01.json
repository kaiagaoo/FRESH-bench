The second stage functions as a self-contained [[spacecraft]] for carrying crew or cargo once in orbit. Both stages are powered by Raptor engines that burn [[liquid oxygen]] and liquid [[methane]] propellants in a highly efficient, full-flow staged combustion power cycle. Both rocket stages are designed to be reused by landing vertically at the launch pad or at a separate platform.\n\nIn its fully reusable configuration, Starship has a payload capacity of {{cvt|100|t|lb}} to [[low Earth orbit]] and is designed to be flown multiple times to spread out the cost of the spacecraft. The spacecraft can be refueled in orbit before traveling to destinations that require more change in [[velocity]] ([[Delta-v budget|delta-''v'' budget]]), such as the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]]. Proposed applications for Starship include regular crewed and cargo launches, building the [[Starlink]] internet constellation, and performing [[Spaceflight#Point-to-point|suborbital point-to-point]] flights on Earth. \n\nPlans to create a heavy-lift launch vehicle at SpaceX date back to 2005. The methane\u2013oxygen engines were in development by 2012 and the plan was announced publicly for the first time in 2016. The [[SpaceX Starship development|development program for Starship]] since 2019 follows an [[Iterative and incremental development|iterative and incremental approach]], involving frequent [[prototype]] construction, testing, and refinement, including low and high-altitude flight tests. As of December 2022, no date for the planned [[SpaceX Starship orbital test flight|first orbital flight test]] has been announced yet.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|History of SpaceX|SpaceX reusable launch system development program|SpaceX Starship development}}\n\nIn November 2005,<ref name=\"tsr20051114\" /> before SpaceX launched its first rocket (the [[Falcon 1]]),<ref>{{cite web |date=24 March 2006 |title=SpaceX rocket fails first flight |language=en-GB |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4698736.stm |url-status=live |access-date=7 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114042636/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4698736.stm |archive-date=14 January 2015}}</ref> CEO [[Elon Musk]] first referenced a [[Heavy-lift launch vehicle|heavy-lift rocket]] concept named BFR that could launch {{cvt|100|t|lb}} to [[low Earth orbit]].

Starship might also launch probes orbiting [[Neptune]] or [[Io (moon)|Io]], or large [[sample-return mission]]s, potentially giving insight into past [[volcanism on the Moon]] and possible [[extraterrestrial life]].<ref name=\":17\" /> The low launch cost may also allow probes to use more-common and cheaper materials, such as glass instead of [[beryllium]] for large telescope mirrors.<ref name=\":61\" />\n\nThere are differing opinions about how Starship's low launch cost will affect the cost of space science. According to [[Waleed Abdalati]], former [[NASA Chief Scientist]], the low launch cost will cheapen satellite replacement and enable more ambitious missions for budget-limited programs. According to Lionnet, low launch cost may not reduce the overall cost of a science mission significantly: Of the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'' space probe]] and [[Philae (spacecraft)|''Philae'' lander]]'s mission cost of $1.7&nbsp;billion, the cost of launch only made up ten percent.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nStarship's lunar lander variant, [[Starship HLS]], is critical to the [[Artemis program]], a current NASA human exploration program of the Moon.<ref name=\":29\" /> The lander is accompanied by Starship tankers and Starship propellant depot variants. The tankers transfer propellant to a depot until it is full, then the depot fuels Starship HLS. The lunar lander is thus endowed with enough thrust to achieve a lunar orbit. Then, the crews onboard the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion spacecraft]] are launched with the [[Space Launch System]]. Orion then docks with Starship HLS and the crews transfer into the lander.
