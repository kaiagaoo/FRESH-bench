This formalises a philosophical position known as [[Mind\u2013body dualism]]<ref  name=\u201dmtb1\u201d>{{cite arXiv |last=Bennett |first=Michael Timothy |date=2022 |title=Computable artificial general intelligence |eprint=2205.10513}}</ref>.

The accompanying experiments (comparing weakness and compression) and mathematical proofs showed that maximising weakness results in the optimal \"ability to complete a wide range of tasks\" <ref name=\u201dmtb2\u201d /> or equivalently \"ability to generalise\" <ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Chollet |first=Francois |date=2019 |title=On the Measure of Intelligence |eprint=1911.01547}}</ref> (thus maximising intelligence by either definition). This also showed that if [[enactivism]] holds and [[Mind\u2013body dualism]] does not, then compression is not necessary or sufficient for intelligence, calling into question widely held views on intelligence (see also [[Hutter Prize]]).\n\nRegardless of the position taken with respect to cognition, whether this type of AGI exhibits human-like behavior (such as the use of natural language) would depend on many factors,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bennett | first1=Michael Timothy | last2=Maruyama | first2=Yoshihiro | date=2022 |title=Philosophical Specification of Empathetic Ethical Artificial Intelligence | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-017-9484-6 | journal=IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=292-300 |doi=10.1109/TCDS.2021.3099945 |access-date=6 December 2022}}</ref> for example the manner in which the agent is embodied,<ref  name=\u201dmtb2\u201d>{{cite conference | conference=14th Conference on Artificial General Intelligence | last=Bennett | first=Michael Timothy | title = Symbol Emergence and The Solutions to Any Task | date=2021 | doi=10.1007/978-3-030-93758-4_4 | url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-93758-4_4}}</ref> or whether it has a reward function that closely approximates human primitives of cognition like hunger, pain and so forth.<ref>{{cite conference | conference=14th Conference on Artificial General Intelligence | last1=Bennett | first1=Michael Timothy | last2=Maruyama | first2=Yoshihiro | title = The Artificial Scientist | date=2021 | doi=10.1007/978-3-030-93758-4_6 | url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-93758-4_6}}</ref>\n\n===Tests for confirming human-level AGI{{anchor|Tests_for_confirming_human-level_AGI}}===\nThe following tests to confirm human-level AGI have been considered:<ref>{{cite web|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|title=What is AGI?|url=http://intelligence.org/2013/08/11/what-is-agi/|publisher=Machine Intelligence Research Institute|access-date=1 May 2014|date=11 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425115445/http://intelligence.org/2013/08/11/what-is-agi/|archive-date=25 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talkyblog.com/artificial_general_intelligence_agi/|title=What is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)? {{!}} 4 Tests For Ensuring Artificial General Intelligence|date=13 July 2019|website=Talky Blog|language=en-US|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717071152/https://www.talkyblog.com/artificial_general_intelligence_agi/|archive-date=17 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n;[[Turing test|The Turing Test]] ([[Alan Turing|''Turing'']])\n: A machine and a human both converse unseen with a second human, who must evaluate which of the two is the machine, which passes the test if it can fool the evaluator a significant fraction of the time.

All of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\n\nA problem is informally known as \"AI-complete\" or \"AI-hard\", if solving it is equivalent to the general aptitude of human intelligence, or strong AI, and is beyond the capabilities of a purpose-specific algorithm.<ref name=\"Shapiro92\">{{cite book |last=Shapiro |first=Stuart C. |year=1992 |chapter-url=http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201014644/http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf |archive-date=1 February 2016 |chapter=Artificial Intelligence |editor=Stuart C.

It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.\n\n===Early estimates===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year. Note the logarithmic scale and exponential trendline, which assumes the computational capacity doubles every 1.1 years. Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} \n\nIn 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).{{efn|In \"Mind Children\"{{sfn|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997,{{sfn|Moravec|1998}} Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps. Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.}} (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating-point operation]]\" \u2013 a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]], while 10<sup>18</sup> was [[Exascale computing|achieved in 2022]].) He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.\n\n===Modelling the neurons in more detail===\nThe [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are known to play a role in cognitive processes.<ref name=\"Discover2011JanFeb\">{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia\u2014the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071350/http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|archive-date=8 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Current research===\nThere are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures.

However, although the task seemed simple at the beginning, the models based on a generic neural network did not work. Currently, the efforts are focused on precise emulation of biological neurons (partly on the molecular level), but the result cannot be called a total success yet.\n\n===Criticisms of simulation-based approaches===\nA fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Vega|Glenberg|Graesser|2008}}. A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree</ref> If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body).

Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"as long as the program works, they don't care if you call it real or a simulation.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} If the program can behave ''as if'' it has a mind, then there's no need to know if it ''actually'' has mind \u2013 indeed, there would be no way to tell. For AI research, Searle's \"weak AI hypothesis\" is equivalent to the statement \"artificial general intelligence is possible\". Thus, according to Russell and Norvig, \"most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} Thus, for academic AI research, \"Strong AI\" and \"AGI\" are two very different things.\n\nIn contrast to Searle and mainstream AI, some futurists such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] use the term \"strong AI\" to mean \"human level artificial general intelligence\".<ref name=K/> This is not the same as Searle's [[strong AI]], unless you assume that [[consciousness]] is necessary for human-level AGI. Academic philosophers such as Searle do not believe that is the case, and artificial intelligence researchers do not care.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\n===Consciousness===\nThere are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].{{efn|Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not.{{sfn|Nagel|1974}}}}\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. As such, preliminary work has been conducted on approaches to integrating full ethical agents with existing legal and social frameworks. These approaches have focused on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref name=\"physica_scripta\">{{Cite journal |last1=Sotala |first1=Kaj |last2=Yampolskiy |first2=Roman V. |author2-link=Roman Yampolskiy |date=2014-12-19 |title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=[[Physica Scripta]] |volume=90 |issue=1 |page=018001 |doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001 |issn=0031-8949 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n[[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.<ref>{{cite magazine| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | magazine=Wired |date=April 2000 }}</ref>\n\nIt remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine. It's also possible that it will become natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]]{{clarify|date=September 2021}}.\n\n==Possible explanations for the slow progress of strong AI research==\n{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems|History of artificial intelligence#Predictions (or \"Where is HAL 9000?\")}}\n{{unclear-section|date=September 2021}}\n\nSince the launch of AI research in 1956, progress in this field of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level has slowed.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} One basic potential explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory, processing power, or chip flexibility to accommodate computer-science-oriented and/or neuroscience-oriented platforms.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=James |first=Alex P. |date=2022 |title=The Why , What , and How of Artificial General Intelligence Chip Development |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9390376 |journal=IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=333\u2013347 |doi=10.1109/TCDS.2021.3069871 |arxiv=2012.06338 |s2cid=228376556 |issn=2379-8920}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Pei |first1=Jing |last2=Deng |first2=Lei |last3=Song |first3=Sen |last4=Zhao |first4=Mingguo |last5=Zhang |first5=Youhui |last6=Wu |first6=Shuang |last7=Wang |first7=Guanrui |last8=Zou |first8=Zhe |last9=Wu |first9=Zhenzhi |last10=He |first10=Wei |last11=Chen |first11=Feng |last12=Deng |first12=Ning |last13=Wu |first13=Si |last14=Wang |first14=Yu |last15=Wu |first15=Yujie |date=2019 |title=Towards artificial general intelligence with hybrid Tianjic chip architecture |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1424-8 |journal=Nature |language=en |volume=572 |issue=7767 |pages=106\u2013111 |doi=10.1038/s41586-019-1424-8 |pmid=31367028 |bibcode=2019Natur.572..106P |s2cid=199056116 |issn=1476-4687}}</ref> In addition, the level of complexity involved in AI research likely also limits the progress of strong AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nConceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. This means situating a strong AI in a sociocultural context where human-like AI derives from human-like experiences. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: \"the framework starts from Weizenbaum's observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts\".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nA fundamental paradox arising from this problem is that AI researchers have only been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, such as mathematics, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do, such as walking ([[Moravec's paradox]]).{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} The problem as described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} The idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually or must be socially situated has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}\n\nThe problems encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AGI research and development through generating a degree of distrust in the field. The failed predictions of success promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish optimism in the primary idea of creating human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the waxing and waning progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Strickland |first=Eliza |date=2021 |title=The Turbulent Past and Uncertain Future of AI: Is there a way out of AI's boom-and-bust cycle? |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/mspec.2021.9563956 |journal=IEEE Spectrum |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=26\u201331 |doi=10.1109/mspec.2021.9563956 |s2cid=238478853 |issn=0018-9235}}</ref> most investigators are optimistic about achieving the goal of AGI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nOther possible reasons have been proposed for the slow progress towards strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers in the task of emulating the function of the human brain in computer hardware through initiatives like the [[Human Brain Project]].{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Yamakawa |first=Hiroshi |date=2021 |title=The whole brain architecture approach: Accelerating the development of artificial general intelligence by referring to the brain |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2021.09.004 |journal=Neural Networks |volume=144 |pages=478\u2013495 |doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2021.09.004 |pmid=34600220 |s2cid=232170707 |issn=0893-6080}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=David T. |last2=Kerber |first2=Kevin A. |date=2022-02-07 |title=Artificial Intelligence and the Practice of Neurology in 2035 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000013200 |journal=Neurology |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=238\u2013245 |doi=10.1212/wnl.0000000000013200 |pmid=35131918 |s2cid=246635279 |issn=0028-3878}}</ref> Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking issues like human brain modelling seriously, AGI researchers then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nHowever, Clocksin states that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that AI researchers may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and for the implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for AGI, a main interest was to emulate and investigate human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} At the time, researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}\n\nIn response, the practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides AI researchers with the option to concentrate on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction operators has posed problems.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}\n\nAnother possible reason for the slowness in strong AI progress relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that human [[heuristics]] is still vastly superior to computer performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Nonetheless, the specific functions that are programmed into increasingly powerful computers may be able to account for many of the requirements in heuristics that eventually allow AI to match human intelligence. Thus, while heuristics is not necessarily a fundamental barrier to achieving strong AI, it is widely agreed to be a challenge.\n\nFinally, many AI researchers have debated whether or not [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Deane |first=George |date=2022 |title=Machines That Feel and Think: The Role of Affective Feelings and Mental Action in (Artificial) General Intelligence |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/artl_a_00368 |journal=Artificial Life |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=289\u2013309 |doi=10.1162/artl_a_00368 |pmid=35881678 |s2cid=251069071 |issn=1064-5462}}</ref> There are no emotions in typical models of AI, and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} However, emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} David Gelernter writes, \"No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.\"{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} Thus, just as this concern over emotion has posed problems for AI researchers, it is likely to continue to challenge the concept of strong AI as its research progresses.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Kaplan Andreas and Haelein Michael (2019) Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?
