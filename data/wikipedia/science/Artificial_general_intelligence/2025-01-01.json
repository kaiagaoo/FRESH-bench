There is debate about whether modern AI systems possess them to an adequate degree.\n\n=== Physical traits ===\nOther capabilities are considered desirable in intelligent systems, as they may affect intelligence or aid in its expression.

A free-floating symbolic level like the software level of a computer will never be reached by this route (or vice versa) \u2013 nor is it clear why we should even try to reach such a level, since it looks as if getting there would just amount to uprooting our symbols from their intrinsic meanings (thereby merely reducing ourselves to the functional equivalent of a programmable computer).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Harnad |first=S. |date=1990 |title=The Symbol Grounding Problem |journal=Physica D |volume=42 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=335\u2013346 |arxiv=cs/9906002 |bibcode=1990PhyD...42..335H |doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90087-6 |s2cid=3204300}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Modern artificial general intelligence research===\nThe term \"artificial general intelligence\" was used as early as 1997, by Mark Gubrud<ref>{{Harvnb|Gubrud|1997}}</ref> in a discussion of the implications of fully automated military production and operations.

Academic philosophers such as Searle do not believe that is the case, and to most artificial intelligence researchers the question is out-of-scope.{{Sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\nMainstream AI is most interested in how a program ''behaves''.<ref>though see [[Explainable artificial intelligence]] for curiosity by the field about why a program behaves the way it does</ref> According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"as long as the program works, they don't care if you call it real or a simulation.\"{{Sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} If the program can behave ''as if'' it has a mind, then there is no need to know if it ''actually'' has mind \u2013 indeed, there would be no way to tell. For AI research, Searle's \"weak AI hypothesis\" is equivalent to the statement \"artificial general intelligence is possible\". Thus, according to Russell and Norvig, \"most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{Sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} Thus, for academic AI research, \"Strong AI\" and \"AGI\" are two different things.\n\n=== Consciousness ===\n\n{{Main article|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nConsciousness can have various meanings, and some aspects play significant roles in science fiction and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n\n* '''[[Sentience]]''' (or \"phenomenal consciousness\"): The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively, as opposed to the ability to ''reason'' about perceptions. Some philosophers, such as [[David Chalmers]], use the term \"consciousness\" to refer exclusively to phenomenal consciousness, which is roughly equivalent to sentience.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Chalmers |first=David J. |date=August 9, 2023 |title=Could a Large Language Model Be Conscious? |url=https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/could-a-large-language-model-be-conscious/ |work=Boston Review}}</ref> Determining why and how subjective experience arises is known as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Seth |first=Anil |title=Consciousness |url=https://www.newscientist.com/definition/consciousness/ |access-date=2024-09-05 |website=New Scientist |language=en-US}}</ref> [[Thomas Nagel]] explained in 1974 that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"[[What Is It Like to Be a Bat?|what does it feel like to be a bat?]]\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e., has consciousness) but a toaster does not.{{Sfn|Nagel|1974}} In 2022, a Google engineer claimed that the company's AI chatbot, [[LaMDA]], had achieved sentience, though this claim was widely disputed by other experts.<ref>{{Cite news |date=11 June 2022 |title=The Google engineer who thinks the company's AI has come to life |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/ |access-date=2023-06-12 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n* '''[[Self-awareness]]''': To have conscious awareness of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be consciously aware of one's own thoughts. This is opposed to simply being the \"subject of one's thought\"\u2014an operating system or debugger is able to be \"aware of itself\" (that is, to represent itself in the same way it represents everything else)\u2014but this is not what people typically mean when they use the term \"self-awareness\".{{Efn|[[Alan Turing]] made this point in 1950.{{Sfn|Turing|1950}}}}\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension.
