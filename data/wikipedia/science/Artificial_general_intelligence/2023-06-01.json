All of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\n\nA problem is informally called \"AI-complete\" or \"AI-hard\" if it is believed that to solve it one would need to implement strong AI, because the solution is beyond the capabilities of a purpose-specific algorithm.<ref name=\"Shapiro92\">{{cite book |last=Shapiro |first=Stuart C. |year=1992 |chapter-url=http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201014644/http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf |archive-date=1 February 2016 |chapter=Artificial Intelligence |editor=Stuart C.

Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} \n\nIn 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).{{efn|In \"Mind Children\"{{sfn|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997,{{sfn|Moravec|1998}} Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps.

A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in broad outline. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate. In addition, the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are known to play a role in cognitive processes.<ref name=\"Discover2011JanFeb\">{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia\u2014the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071350/http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|archive-date=8 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Current research===\nSome research projects are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures.

The behaviour of a \"weak AI\" machine would be precisely identical to a \"strong AI\" machine, but the latter would also have subjective conscious experience. This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.<ref>For example:\n* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203103022/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html |date=3 December 2007 }} (quoted in \"High Beam Encyclopedia\"),\n* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074502/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html |date=19 July 2008 }} (quoted in \"AITopics\")\n* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031753/http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm |date=13 May 2008 }} Anthony Tongen</ref>\n\nMainstream AI is most interested in how a program ''behaves''.<ref>though see [[Explainable artificial intelligence]] for curiosity by the field about why a program behaves the way it does</ref> According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"as long as the program works, they don't care if you call it real or a simulation.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} If the program can behave ''as if'' it has a mind, then there is no need to know if it ''actually'' has mind \u2013 indeed, there would be no way to tell. For AI research, Searle's \"weak AI hypothesis\" is equivalent to the statement \"artificial general intelligence is possible\". Thus, according to Russell and Norvig, \"most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} Thus, for academic AI research, \"Strong AI\" and \"AGI\" are two very different things.\n\nIn contrast to Searle and mainstream AI, some futurists such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] use the term \"strong AI\" to mean \"human level artificial general intelligence\".<ref name=K/> This is not the same as Searle's [[strong AI]], unless you assume that [[consciousness]] is necessary for human-level AGI.

A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not.{{sfn|Nagel|1974}}}}\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]].

The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is possible that some of these traits [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine. It is also possible that people will ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital.
