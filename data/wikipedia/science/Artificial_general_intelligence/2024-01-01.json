If the grounding considerations in this paper are valid, then this expectation is hopelessly modular and there is really only one viable route from sense to symbols: from the ground up. A free-floating symbolic level like the software level of a computer will never be reached by this route (or vice versa) \u2013 nor is it clear why we should even try to reach such a level, since it looks as if getting there would just amount to uprooting our symbols from their intrinsic meanings (thereby merely reducing ourselves to the functional equivalent of a programmable computer).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harnad |first1=S. |year=1990 |title=The Symbol Grounding Problem |journal=Physica D |volume=42 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=335\u2013346 |arxiv=cs/9906002 |bibcode=1990PhyD...42..335H |doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90087-6 |s2cid=3204300}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Modern artificial general intelligence research===\nThe term \"artificial general intelligence\" was used as early as 1997, by Mark Gubrud<ref>{{Harvnb|Gubrud|1997}}</ref> in a discussion of the implications of fully automated military production and operations.

[[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the computing power required to emulate it.\n\n===Early estimates===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year.

Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. The brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}}\n\nIn 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).{{efn|In \"Mind Children\"{{sfn|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997,{{sfn|Moravec|1998}} Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps. Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.}} (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating-point operation]]\" \u2013 a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]], while 10<sup>18</sup> was [[Exascale computing|achieved in 2022]].)

The behaviour of a \"weak AI\" machine would be precisely identical to a \"strong AI\" machine, but the latter would also have subjective conscious experience. This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.<ref>For example:\n\n* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203103022/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html|date=3 December 2007}} (quoted in \" Encyclopedia.com\"),\n* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074502/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html|date=19 July 2008}} (quoted in \"AITopics\"),\n* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031753/http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm|date=13 May 2008}} Anthony Tongen</ref>\n\nIn contrast to Searle and mainstream AI, some futurists such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] use the term \"strong AI\" to mean \"human level artificial general intelligence\".<ref name=K/> This is not the same as Searle's [[Chinese room#Strong AI|strong AI]], unless it is assumed that [[consciousness]] is necessary for human-level AGI. Academic philosophers such as Searle do not believe that is the case, and to most artificial intelligence researchers the question is out-of-scope.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\nMainstream AI is most interested in how a program ''behaves''.<ref>though see [[Explainable artificial intelligence]] for curiosity by the field about why a program behaves the way it does</ref> According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"as long as the program works, they don't care if you call it real or a simulation.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} If the program can behave ''as if'' it has a mind, then there is no need to know if it ''actually'' has mind \u2013 indeed, there would be no way to tell. For AI research, Searle's \"weak AI hypothesis\" is equivalent to the statement \"artificial general intelligence is possible\". Thus, according to Russell and Norvig, \"most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} Thus, for academic AI research, \"Strong AI\" and \"AGI\" are two different things.\n\n===Consciousness, self-awareness, sentience===\nOther aspects of the human mind besides intelligence are relevant to the concept of AGI or \"strong AI\", and these play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]]. [[Thomas Nagel]] explains that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not.{{sfn|Nagel|1974}}\n* [[self-awareness]]: To have conscious awareness of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be consciously aware of one's own thoughts. This is opposed to simply being the \"subject of one's thought\" \u2013 an operating system or debugger is able to be \"aware of itself\" (that is, to represent itself in the same way it represents everything else) but this is not what people typically mean when they use the term \"self-awareness\".{{efn|[[Alan Turing]] made this point in 1950.{{sfn|Turing|1950}}}}\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively, as opposed to the ability to ''reason'' about perceptions or, in regard to emotions, to be aware that the situation requires urgency, kindness or aggression. For example, we can build a machine that knows which objects in its field of view are red, but this machine will not necessarily know ''what red looks like''.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of \"strong AI\" may have rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. Preliminary work has been conducted on integrating strong AI with existing legal and social frameworks, focusing on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref name=\"physica_scripta\">{{Cite journal |last1=Sotala |first1=Kaj |last2=Yampolskiy |first2=Roman V. |author2-link=Roman Yampolskiy |date=2014-12-19 |title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=[[Physica Scripta]] |volume=90 |issue=1 |page=018001 |doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001 |issn=0031-8949 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIt remains to be shown whether \"[[artificial consciousness]]\" is [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for AGI.
