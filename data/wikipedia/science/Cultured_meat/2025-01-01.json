Stem cells are undifferentiated cells which have the potential to become many or all of the required kinds of specialized cell types. Totipotent stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into all the different cell types found within the body. Pluripotent stem cells can mature into all cell types save those in the placenta, and multipotent stem cells can differentiate into several specialized cell types within one lineage. Unipotent stem cells can differentiate into one specific cell fate.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|title=Frequently asked questions about stem cell research|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117|access-date=2020-10-17|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|archive-date=18 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018034746/https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117|url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:Stem cell differentiation.svg|thumb|275x275px|Stem cells can differentiate into a range of specialized cells.]]\nWhile pluripotent stem cells would be an ideal source, the most prominent example of this subcategory is [[embryonic stem cells]] which\u2014due to ethical issues\u2014are controversial for use in research. As a result, scientists have developed [[induced pluripotent stem cells]] (iPSCs)\u2014essentially multipotent blood and skin cells that have been regressed to a pluripotent state enabling them to differentiate into a greater range of cells.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|title=Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS) {{!}} UCLA Broad Stem Cell Center|url=https://stemcell.ucla.edu/induced-pluripotent-stem-cells#:~:text=iPSC%20are%20derived%20from%20skin,cell%20needed%20for%20therapeutic%20purposes.|access-date=2020-10-17|website=stemcell.ucla.edu|archive-date=18 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018073232/https://stemcell.ucla.edu/induced-pluripotent-stem-cells#:~:text=iPSC%20are%20derived%20from%20skin,cell%20needed%20for%20therapeutic%20purposes.|url-status=live}}</ref> The alternative is using multipotent adult stem cells that give rise to muscle cell lineages or unipotent progenitors which differentiate into muscle cells.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nFavourable characteristics of stem cells include immortality, proliferative ability, unreliance on adherence, serum independence and easy differentiation into tissue. The natural presence of such characteristics are likely to differ across cell species and origin. As such, ''in vitro'' cultivation must be adjusted to fill the exact needs of a specific cell line. The immortality issue is that cells have a limit on the number of times they can divide that is dictated by their [[telomere]] cap\u2014supplementary [[nucleotide]] bases added to the end of their chromosomes. With each division, the telomere cap progressively shortens until nothing remains, at which time the cells cease to divide. Induced pluripotency can lengthen telomere cap such that the cells divide indefinitely.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nCell lines can be collected from a primary source, i.e., through a [[biopsy]] on an animal under local anesthesia. They could also be established from secondary sources such as cryopreserved cultures (cultures frozen after previous research).{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}\n\n===Growth medium===\n[[File:Myoblasts.png|thumb|Myoblasts are one precursor to muscle cells, and their fibers are shown in yellow and nuclei shown in blue.|251x251px]]\nOnce cell lines are established, they are immersed in a [[Growth medium|culture media]] to induce them to proliferate. Culture media are typically formulated from basal media that provide cells with necessary carbohydrates, fats, proteins and salts. Once a cell consumes a sufficient amount, it divides and the population increases exponentially. Culture media can be supplemented with additives\u2014for instance sera\u2014that supply additional growth factors. Growth factors can be secreted proteins or steroids that are crucial in regulating cellular processes.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOnce differentiation begins, muscle fibres begin to contract and generate lactic acid. Cells' ability to absorb nutrients and proliferate in part depends on the pH of their environment. As lactic acid accumulates within the media, the environment will become progressively more acidic and falls below the optimal pH. As a result, culture media must be frequently refreshed. This helps refresh the concentration of nutrients from the basal media.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n===Scaffold===\n[[File:Muscle Tissue Smooth (40087100000).jpg|thumb|Muscle tissue is developed from the growth medium and organized in a three-dimensional structure by the scaffold for end product.|258x258px]]\nIn the case of structured meat products\u2014products that are characterized by their overall  configuration as well as cell type\u2014cells must be seeded to scaffolds. Scaffolds are essentially molds meant to reflect and encourage the cells to organize into a larger structure. When cells develop ''in vivo'', they are influenced by their interactions with the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM). The ECM is the 3-dimensional mesh of [[glycoproteins]], [[collagen]] and [[enzymes]] responsible for transmitting mechanical and biochemical cues to the cell. Scaffolds need to simulate the characteristics of the ECM.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Porosity ====\nPores are minute openings on the surface of the scaffold. They can be created on the surface of the biomaterial in order to release cellular components that could interfere with tissue development. They also help diffuse gas and nutrients to the innermost layers of adherent cells, preventing a \"necrotic center\" from forming.  A necrotic center is a phenomenon in which cells that are not in direct contact with the culture medium die from a lack of nutrients.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Vascularization ====\nVascular tissue found in plants contains the organs responsible for internally transporting fluids. It forms natural topographies that provide a low cost way to promote cell alignment by replicating the natural physiological state of myoblasts. It may also help with gas and nutrient exchange.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Biochemical properties====\nA scaffold's biochemical properties should be similar to those of the ECM. It must facilitate cell adhesion through textural qualities or chemical bonding. Additionally, it must produce the chemical cues that encourage cell differentiation. Alternatively, the material should be able to blend with other substances which have these functional qualities.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Crystallinity ====\nThe degree of a material's crystallinity determines qualities such as rigidity. High crystallinity can be attributed to hydrogen bonding which in turn increases thermal stability, tensile strength (important for maintaining the scaffold's shape), water retention (important for hydrating the cells) and [[Young's modulus]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Degradation ====\nCertain materials degrade into compounds that are beneficial to cells, although this degradation can also be irrelevant or detrimental. Degradation allows easy removal of the scaffold from the finished product leaving only animal tissue\u2014thereby increasing its resemblance to ''in vivo'' meat. This degradation can be induced by exposure to certain enzymes which do not impact the muscle tissue.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Edibility ====\nIf scaffolds are unable to be removed from the animal tissue, they must be edible to ensure consumer safety. It would be beneficial if they were to be made out of nutritious ingredients.<ref name=\":7\" /> Since 2010, academic research groups and companies have emerged in order to identify raw materials that have the characteristics of suitable scaffolds.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" />\n\n==== Cellulose ====\n[[Cellulose]] is the most abundant polymer in nature and provides the [[exoskeletons]] of plant leaves. Due to its abundance, it can be obtained at a relatively low cost. It is also versatile and biocompatible. Through a process called \"decellularization\", it is coated in a [[surfactant]] that creates pores. These pores release the plant's cellular components, and it becomes decellularized plant tissue. This material has been extensively studied by the Pelling and Gaudette Groups at [[University of Ottawa]] and [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]], respectively. Through cross-linking (forming [[covalent bonds]] between individual polymer chains to hold them together) the plant tissue's mechanical properties can be changed so that it more closely resembles muscle tissue. This can also be done by blending plant tissue with other materials. On the other hand, decellularized plant tissue typically lacks mammalian biochemical cues, so it needs to be coated with compensatory functional proteins. [[C2C12]] growth was not shown to change significantly between the bare scaffold and the same scaffold with a coating of collagen or [[gelatin]] proteins; however, seeding efficiency (rate at which cells attach to the scaffold) improved.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last1=Campuzano|first1=Santiago|last2=Pelling|first2=Andrew E.|date=2019|title=Scaffolds for 3D Cell Culture and Cellular Agriculture Applications Derived From Non-animal Sources|journal=Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems|language=en|volume=3|doi=10.3389/fsufs.2019.00038|s2cid=157058210|issn=2571-581X|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last1=Adamski|first1=Michal|last2=Fontana|first2=Gianluca|last3=Gershlak|first3=Joshua R.|last4=Gaudette|first4=Glenn R.|last5=Le|first5=Hau D.|last6=Murphy|first6=William L.|date=2018-05-31|title=Two Methods for Decellularization of Plant Tissues for Tissue Engineering Applications|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments |issue=135|doi=10.3791/57586|issn=1940-087X|pmc=6101437|pmid=29912197}}</ref>\n\nAn advantage of decellularized plant tissue is the natural topography afforded by the leaf vasculature. This helps replicate the natural physiological state of the myoblasts which promotes cell alignment. The other ways of doing this are usually quite a bit more expensive including 3D printing, soft lithography and photolithography. Vascularization can also help overcome the 100\u2013200&nbsp;nm diffusion limit of culture medium into cells that usually produce necrotic centres in muscle conglomerates. Another way to do this is by having a porous scaffold which supports [[angiogenesis]] (the development of new blood vessels). While this has been shown to work for apple [[Hypanthium]], not all plants are nearly as porous. The alternative to plant cellulose is bacterial cellulose which is typically more pure than plant cellulose as it is free from contaminants such as [[lignin]] and [[hemicellulose]]. Bacterial cellulose has more hydrogen bonding between its polymer strands and so it has greater crystallinity. It also has smaller [[microfibrils]] that allow it to retain more moisture and have smaller pores. The substance can be produced using waste carbohydrates (which may allow it to be produced less expensively) and it adds juiciness and chewiness to emulsified meat (which would mean that even if it can't be taken out of the final product, it will contribute to the texture profile).<ref name=\":7\"/><ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n==== Chitin ====\n[[Chitin]] is nature's second most abundant polymer. It is found in the exoskeletons of [[crustaceans]] and [[fungi]]. As cellular agriculture is attempting to end reliance on animals, chitin derived from fungi is of greater interest. It has mostly been studied by Pelling Group. [[Chitosan]] is derived from chitin in a process known as alkaline deacetylation (substituting out certain [[amino acid]] groups). The degree of this process determines the physical and chemical properties of the chitosan. Chitosan has antibacterial properties; in particular, it has bactericidal effects on [[plankton]]ic bacteria and [[biofilms]] and a bacteria static effects on [[gram negative bacteria|gram negative]] bacteria such as ''[[E. coli]]''. This is important as it neutralizes potentially harmful compounds without using [[antibiotics]], which many consumers avoid. Chitosan's resemblance to [[glycosaminoglycans]] and internal interactions between glycoproteins and [[proteoglycans]] make it highly biocompatible. It can easily blend with other polymers in order to select for more bioactive factors. One potential disadvantage of chitosan is that it degrades in the presence of [[lysozymes]] (naturally occurring enzymes). But, this can be resisted using [[Acetylation|deacetylation]]. This is not entirely negative, as the byproducts produced through degradation have anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. It is important to match the level that cells rely on the matrix for structure with degradation.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Collagen ====\n[[Collagen]] is a family of proteins that makes up the primary structure of human connective tissue. It is typically derived from bovine, porcine and [[Murinae|murine]] sources. Cellular agriculture overcomes this dependency through the use of transgenic organisms that are capable of producing the amino acid repeats that make up the collagen. Collagen naturally exists as collagen type I. It has been produced as porous hydrogels, composites and substrates with topographical cues and biochemical properties. Synthetic kinds of collagen have been produced through recombinant protein production\u2014collagen type II and III, [[tropoelastin]] and [[fibronectin]]. One challenge with these proteins is that they can not be modified post translation. However, an alternative fibrillar protein has been isolated in microbes that lack collagen's biochemical cues, but has its kind of gene customizability. One focus of recombinant collagen production is yield optimization\u2014how it can be produced most effectively. Plants, in particular, tobacco look like the best option, however, bacteria and yeast are also viable alternatives.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nTextured soy protein is a soy flour product often used in plant-based meat that supports the growth of bovine cells. Its spongy texture enables efficient cell seeding and its porosity encourages oxygen transfer. Additionally, it degrades during cell differentiation into compounds that are beneficial to certain cells.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n==== Mycelium ====\n[[Mycelium]] are the roots of mushrooms.

It was developed by the Parker Group at Harvard. Their platform uses centrifugal force to extrude a polymer solution through an opening in a rotating reservoir. During extrusion, the solution forms a jet that elongates and aligns as it crosses the air gap. The jet is directed into a vortex-controlled precipitation bath that chemically cross links or precipitates polymer nanofibers. Adjusting air gap, rotation and the solution changes the diameter of the resulting fibres. This method can spin scaffolds out of PPTA, nylon, DNA and nanofiber sheets. A nanofibrous scaffold made from [[alginate]] and gelatin was able to support the growth of C2C12 cells. Rabbit and bovine aortic smooth muscle myoblasts were able to adhere to the gelatin fibres. They formed aggregates on shorter fibres, and aligned tissue on the longer ones.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Grant M.|last2=MacQueen|first2=Luke A.|last3=Lind|first3=Johan U.|last4=Fitzgibbons|first4=Stacey A.|last5=Chantre|first5=Christophe O.|last6=Huggler|first6=Isabelle|last7=Golecki|first7=Holly M.|last8=Goss|first8=Josue A.|last9=Parker|first9=Kevin Kit|date=2017|title=Production of Synthetic, Para-Aramid and Biopolymer Nanofibers by Immersion Rotary Jet-Spinning|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mame.201600365|journal=Macromolecular Materials and Engineering|volume=302|issue=1|page=1600365|doi=10.1002/mame.201600365|issn=1439-2054|access-date=19 October 2020|archive-date=19 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201019075117/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mame.201600365|url-status=live}}</ref> Matrix Meats is using [[electrospinning]]\u2014a process that uses electric force to turn charged polymers into fibres for scaffolds.

[[Bioreactors]] are large machines similar to brewery tanks which expose the cells to a large variety of environmental factors that are necessary to promote either proliferation or differentiation. The temperature of the bioreactor must replicate ''in vivo'' conditions. In the case of mammalian cells, this requires heating to 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (99&nbsp;\u00b0F). Alternatively, insect cells can be grown at room temperature. Most bioreactors are maintained at 5% carbon dioxide.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last1=Rubio|first1=Natalie R.|last2=Fish|first2=Kyle D.|last3=Trimmer|first3=Barry A.|author4-link=David L.

The former entails inoculating and harvesting cells in a constant process so that there are always cells in the bioreactor. Fed-batch systems mean inoculating the cells, culturing them and harvesting them in a single period.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nStirred tank bioreactors are the most widely used configuration. An impeller increases the flow, thereby homogenizing the culture media and a diffuser facilitates the exchange of oxygen into the media. This system is generally used for suspended cultures but can be used for cells that require attachment to another surface if microcarriers are included. Fixed bed bioreactors are commonly used for adherent cultures. They feature strips of fibres that are packed together to form a bed to which cells can attach. Aerated culture media is circulated through the bed. In airlift bioreactors, the culture media is aerated into a gaseous form using air bubbles which are then scattered and dispersed amongst the cells. Perfusion bioreactors are common configurations for continuous cultivation. They continuously drain media saturated with lactic acid that is void of nutrients and fill it with replenished media.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What Are the Different Types of Bioreactors? - Biotech Blog|url=https://www.pall.com/en/biotech/blog/types-of-bioreactor.html#:~:text=March%2011,%202020,be%20sterilized%20in%20an%20autoclave.|access-date=2020-10-19|website=www.pall.com|archive-date=22 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022220814/https://www.pall.com/en/biotech/blog/types-of-bioreactor.html#:~:text=March%2011,%202020,be%20sterilized%20in%20an%20autoclave.|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Challenges==\n\n=== Growth factors ===\nThe culture media is an essential component of ''in vitro'' cultivation. It is responsible for providing the macromolecules, nutrients and growth factors necessary for cell proliferation. Sourcing growth factors is one of the most challenging tasks of cellular agriculture. Traditionally, it involves the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) which is a blood product extracted from fetal cows. Besides the argument that its production is unethical, it also violates the notion that the cultured meat is produced independent of the use of animals. It is also the most costly constituent of cultured meat, priced at around $1000 per litre. Furthermore, chemical composition varies greatly depending on the animal, so it cannot be uniformly quantified chemically.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dessels|first1=Carla|last2=Potgieter|first2=Marnie|last3=Pepper|first3=Michael S.|date=2016|title=Making the Switch: Alternatives to Fetal Bovine Serum for Adipose-Derived Stromal Cell Expansion|journal=Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology|language=en|volume=4|page=115|doi=10.3389/fcell.2016.00115|pmid=27800478|pmc=5065960|issn=2296-634X|doi-access=free}}</ref> FBS is employed because it conveniently mimics the process of muscle development ''in vivo''. The growth factors needed for tissue development are predominantly provided through an animal's bloodstream, and no other known fluid can single-handedly deliver all these components.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe current alternative is to generate each growth factor individually using recombinant protein production. In this process, the genes coding for the specific factor are integrated into bacteria which are then fermented. Due to the added complexity of this process, it is particularly expensive.<ref name=\":5\" /> Future Fields, a Canadian company focused on overcoming the economic and environmental costs of traditional growth media, is developing serum-free growth factors from fruit flies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Future Fields Cellular Agriculture & Biomanufacturing|url=https://www.futurefields.io/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=www.futurefields.io|language=en|archive-date=30 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030025600/https://www.futurefields.io/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe ideal medium would be chemically quantifiable and accessible to ensure simplicity in production, cheap and not dependent on animals.<ref name=\":2\" /> It will most likely be derived from plants; and while this may reduce the possibility of transmitting infectious agents, it may induce allergic reactions in some consumers.<ref>I.

In the cell proliferation phase, prior to the introduction of the scaffold, many cell types need to be attached to a surface to support growth. As such, cells must be grown in confluent monolayers only one cell thick which necessitates a lot of surface area. This poses practical challenges on large scales. As such, systems may incorporate microcarriers\u2014small spherical beads of glass or other compatible material that are suspended in the culture medium. Cells adhere to these microcarriers as they would to the sides of the bioreactor, which increases the amount of surface area.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|title=How it's made: the science behind cultivated meat|url=http://elliotswartz.com/cellbasedmeat/cleanmeat301|access-date=2020-10-19|website=A Bit of Science|language=en-US|archive-date=19 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201019141119/http://elliotswartz.com/cellbasedmeat/cleanmeat301|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the cell differentiation phase, the cells may be seeded to a scaffold and so do not require the use of microcarriers. However, in these instances, the density of the cells on the scaffold means that not all cells have an interface with culture media, leading to cell death and necrotic centers within the meat. When muscle is cultivated ''in vivo'', this issue is circumvented as the extracellular matrix delivers nutrients into the muscle through blood vessels. As such, many emerging scaffolds aim to replicate such networks.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nSimilarly, scaffolds must simulate many of the other characteristics of the extracellular matrix, most notably porosity, crystallinity, degradation, biocompatibility and functionality. Few materials that emulate all these characteristics have been identified, leading to the possibility of blending different materials with complementary properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Research support ===\nCellular agriculture research does not have a significant basis of academic interest or funding streams.<ref name=\":12\" /> Consequently, the majority of research has been undertaken and funded by independent institutions.

Sustain. Food Syst.'' addresses the social and economic opportunities and challenges of cultured and plant-based meat for rural producers. According to this research, cellular agriculture offers \"opportunities such as growing crops as ingredients for feedstock for cultured meat; raising animals for genetic material for cultured meat; producing cultured meat in bioreactors at the farm level; transitioning into new sectors; new market opportunities for blended and hybrid animal- and alt-meat products; and new value around regenerative or high-animal welfare farming.\" Some challenges are also identified, with possible \"loss of livelihood or income for ranchers and livestock producers and for farmers growing crops for animal feed; barriers to transitioning into emerging alt-meat sectors; and the possibility of exclusion from those sectors.\" \nSome farmers already see the potential of cellular agriculture.

For this to happen, the bacteria needs to be competent (i.e. able to accept foreign, extracellular DNA) and able to horizontally transfer genes (i.e. integrate the foreign genes into its own DNA). Horizontal gene transfer is significantly more challenging in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms than [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms because the former have both a cell membrane and a nuclear membrane which the plasmid needs to penetrate whereas prokaryotic organisms only have a cell membrane. For this reason, prokaryotic bacteria are often favoured. In order to make such a bacteria temporarily competent, it can be exposed to a salt such as [[calcium chloride]], which neutralizes the negative charges on the cell membrane's [[phosphate]] heads as well as the negative charges on the plasmid to prevent the two from repelling. The bacteria can incubate in warm water, opening large pores on the cell surface through which the plasmid can enter.<ref>{{Cite news|title=CaCl2 Transformation Technique|url=https://www.mybiosource.com/learn/testing-procedures/cacl2-transformation-technique/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=MyBioSource Learning Center|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nNext, the bacteria is fermented in sugar, which encourages it to grow and duplicate. In the process it expresses its DNA as well as the transferred plasmid resulting in protein.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} Finally, the solution is purified to separate out the residual protein. This can be done by introducing an [[antibody]] raised against the protein of interest that will kill bacteria cells that do not contain the protein. Through centrifugation, the solution can be spun around an axis with sufficient force to separate solids from liquids. Alternatively it could be soaked in a buffered ionic solution that employs [[osmosis]] to leach the water from bacteria and kill them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wingfield|first=Paul
