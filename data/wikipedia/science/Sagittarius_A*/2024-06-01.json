The observations of S2 used [[near-infrared]] (NIR) [[Astronomical interferometer|interferometry]] (in the Ks-band, i.e. 2.1&nbsp;[[\u03bcm]]) because of reduced [[Extinction (astronomy)|interstellar extinction]] in this band.

Supporting this hypothesis, G1, a cloud that passed near the black hole 13 years ago, had an orbit almost identical to G2, consistent with both clouds, and a gas tail thought to be trailing G2, all being denser clumps within a large single gas stream.<ref name=\"nature140721\">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/why-galactic-black-hole-fireworks-were-a-flop-1.15591 |title=Why galactic black hole fireworks were a flop : Nature News & Comment |journal=Nature |access-date=2015-02-27 |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15591 |year=2014 |last1=Cowen |first1=Ron |s2cid=124346286 |archive-date=2015-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219013446/http://www.nature.com/news/why-galactic-black-hole-fireworks-were-a-flop-1.15591 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pfuhl|first1=Oliver|last2=Gillessen|first2=Stefan|last3=Eisenhauer|first3=Frank|last4=Genzel|first4=Reinhard|last5=Plewa|first5=Philipp M.|last6=Thomas Ott|last7=Ballone|first7=Alessandro|last8=Schartmann|first8=Marc|last9=Burkert|first9=Andreas|date=2015|title=The Galactic Center Cloud G2 and its Gas Streamer|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=798|issue=2|page=111|doi=10.1088/0004-637x/798/2/111|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1407.4354|bibcode=2015ApJ...798..111P|s2cid=118440030}}</ref>\n\n[[Andrea M.
