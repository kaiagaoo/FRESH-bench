The interactions between all the particles described by the Standard Model are summarized by the diagrams on the right of this section.\n\n=== Higgs boson ===\n{{Main|Higgs boson}}\n\nThe Higgs particle is a massive [[Scalar field theory|scalar]] elementary particle theorized by [[Peter Higgs]] ([[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|and others]]) in 1964, when he showed that Goldstone's 1962 theorem (generic continuous symmetry, which is spontaneously broken) provides a third polarisation of a massive vector field. Hence, Goldstone's original scalar doublet, the massive spin-zero particle, was [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|proposed as the Higgs boson]], and is a key building block in the Standard Model.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=G.S.

In particular, the Higgs boson explains why the photon has no mass, while the [[W and Z bosons]] are very heavy. Elementary-particle masses and the differences between [[electromagnetism]] (mediated by the photon) and the [[weak force]] (mediated by the W and Z bosons) are critical to many aspects of the structure of microscopic (and hence macroscopic) matter. In [[electroweak interaction|electroweak theory]], the Higgs boson generates the masses of the leptons (electron, muon, and tau) and quarks.  As the Higgs boson is massive, it must interact with itself.\n\nBecause the Higgs boson is a very massive particle and also decays almost immediately when created, only a very high-energy [[particle accelerator]] can observe and record it. Experiments to confirm and determine the nature of the Higgs boson using the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at [[CERN]] began in early 2010 and were performed at [[Fermilab]]'s [[Tevatron]] until its closure in late 2011. Mathematical consistency of the Standard Model requires that any mechanism capable of generating the masses of elementary particles must become visible{{clarify|reason=Isn't \"apparent\" or \"manifest\" needed here instead of \"visible\"?|date=July 2013}} at energies above {{val|1.4|ul=TeV}};<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author1=B.W.

It consists of the familiar [[translational symmetry]], [[rotational symmetry]] and the inertial reference frame invariance central to the theory of [[special relativity]]. The [[Local symmetry|local]] SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1) [[gauge symmetry]] is an [[Internal symmetries|internal symmetry]] that essentially defines the Standard Model. Roughly, the three factors of the gauge symmetry give rise to the three fundamental interactions. The fields fall into different [[Representation of a Lie group|representations]] of the various symmetry groups of the Standard Model (see table). Upon writing the most general Lagrangian, one finds that the dynamics depends on 19 parameters, whose numerical values are established by experiment. The parameters are summarized in the table (made visible by clicking \"show\") above.\n\n==== Quantum chromodynamics sector ====\n{{Main|Quantum chromodynamics}}\nThe quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sector defines the interactions between quarks and gluons, which is a [[Yang\u2013Mills theory|Yang\u2013Mills gauge theory]] with SU(3) symmetry, generated by <math>T^a = \\lambda^a/2</math>. Since leptons do not interact with gluons, they are not affected by this sector. The Dirac Lagrangian of the quarks coupled to the gluon fields is given by\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\mathcal{L}_\\text{QCD} = \\overline{\\psi} i\\gamma^\\mu D_{\\mu} \\psi - \\frac{1}{4} G^a_{\\mu\\nu} G^{\\mu\\nu}_a,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\psi</math> is a three component column vector of [[Dirac Spinor|Dirac Spinors]], each element of which refers to a quark field with a specific [[color charge]] (i.e. red, blue, and green) and summation over [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavor]] (i.e. up, down, strange, etc.) is implied. \n\nThe gauge covariant derivative of QCD is defined by <math>D_{\\mu} \\equiv \\partial_\\mu - i g_s\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^a G_\\mu^a</math>, where\n* {{mvar|\u03b3{{isup|\u03bc}}}} are the [[Dirac matrices]],\n* {{mvar|G{{su|b=\u03bc|p=a}}}} is the 8-component (<math>a = 1, 2, \\dots, 8</math>) SU(3) gauge field,\n* {{mvar|\u03bb{{su|p=a}}}} are the 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 [[Gell-Mann matrices]], generators of the SU(3) color group,\n* {{mvar|G{{su|b=\u03bc\u03bd|p=a}}}} represents the [[gluon field strength tensor]], and\n* {{mvar|g<sub>s</sub>}} is the strong coupling constant.\n\nThe QCD Lagrangian is invariant under local SU(3) gauge transformations; i.e., transformations of the form <math>\\psi \\rightarrow \\psi' = U\\psi</math>, where <math>U = e^{-i g_s\\lambda^a \\phi^{a}(x)}</math> is <math>3\\times 3</math> unitary matrix with determinant 1, making it a member of the group SU(3), and <math>\\phi^{a}(x)</math> is an arbitrary function of spacetime.\n\n==== Electroweak sector ====\n{{Main|Electroweak interaction}}\nThe electroweak sector is a [[Yang\u2013Mills theory|Yang\u2013Mills gauge theory]] with the symmetry group U(1)\u202f\u00d7\u202fSU(2)<sub>L</sub>,\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\mathcal{L}_\\text{EW} = \\overline{Q}_{Lj} i\\gamma^\\mu D_{\\mu} Q_{Lj} + \\overline{u}_{Rj} i\\gamma^\\mu D_{\\mu} u_{Rj} + \\overline{d}_{Rj} i\\gamma^\\mu D_{\\mu} d_{Rj} + \\overline{\\ell}_{Lj} i\\gamma^\\mu D_{\\mu} \\ell_{Lj} + \\overline{e}_{Rj} i\\gamma^\\mu D_{\\mu} e_{Rj} - \\tfrac{1}{4} W_a^{\\mu\\nu} W_{\\mu\\nu}^a - \\tfrac{1}{4} B^{\\mu\\nu} B_{\\mu\\nu}, </math>\n\nwhere the subscript <math>j</math> sums over the three generations of fermions; <math>Q_L, u_R</math>, and <math>d_R</math> are the left-handed doublet, right-handed singlet up type, and right handed singlet down type quark fields; and <math>\\ell_L</math> and <math>e_R</math> are the left-handed doublet and right-handed singlet lepton fields. \n\nThe electroweak [[gauge covariant derivative]] is defined as <math>D_\\mu \\equiv \\partial_\\mu - ig' \\tfrac12 Y_\\text{W} B_\\mu - ig \\tfrac{1}{2} \\vec\\tau_\\text{L} \\vec W_\\mu</math>, where \n* {{mvar|B<sub>\u03bc</sub>}} is the U(1) gauge field,\n* {{math|''Y''<sub>W</sub>}} is the [[weak hypercharge]] \u2013 the generator of the U(1) group,\n* {{math|{{vec|''W''}}<sub>''\u03bc''</sub>}} is the 3-component SU(2) gauge field,\n* {{math|{{vec|''\u03c4''<sub>L</sub>}}}} are the [[Pauli matrices]] \u2013 infinitesimal generators of the SU(2) group \u2013 with subscript L to indicate that they only act on ''left''-chiral fermions,\n* {{mvar|g'}} and {{mvar|g}} are the U(1) and SU(2) coupling constants respectively,\n* <math>W^{a\\mu\\nu}</math> (<math>a = 1, 2, 3</math>) and <math>B^{\\mu\\nu}</math> are the [[field strength tensor]]s for the weak isospin and weak hypercharge fields.\n\nNotice that the addition of fermion mass terms into the electroweak Lagrangian is forbidden, since terms of the form <math>m\\overline\\psi\\psi</math> do not respect U(1)\u202f\u00d7\u202fSU(2)<sub>L</sub> gauge invariance. Neither is it possible to add explicit mass terms for the U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields. The Higgs mechanism is responsible for the generation of the gauge boson masses, and the fermion masses result from Yukawa-type interactions with the Higgs field.\n\n==== Higgs sector ====\n{{Main|Higgs mechanism}}\nIn the Standard Model, the [[Higgs field]] is an <math>\\operatorname{SU}(2)_\\text{L}</math> doublet of complex [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] fields with four degrees of freedom:\n\n<math display=\"block\"> \n\\varphi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varphi^+ \\\\ \\varphi^0 \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} \\varphi_1 + i\\varphi_2 \\\\ \\varphi_3 + i\\varphi_4 \\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\nwhere the superscripts + and 0 indicate the electric charge <math>Q</math> of the components. The weak hypercharge <math>Y_\\text{W}</math> of both components is 1. Before symmetry breaking, the Higgs Lagrangian is\n<math display=\"block\"> \\mathcal{L}_\\text{H} = \\left(D_{\\mu}\\varphi\\right)^{\\dagger} \\left(D^{\\mu}\\varphi \\right) - V(\\varphi),</math>\nwhere <math>D_{\\mu}</math> is the electroweak gauge covariant derivative defined above and <math>V(\\varphi)</math> is the potential of the Higgs field. The square of the covariant derivative leads to three and four point interactions between the electroweak gauge fields <math>W^{a}_{\\mu}</math> and <math>B_{\\mu}</math> and the scalar field <math>\\varphi</math>. The scalar potential is given by\n<math display=\"block\"> V(\\varphi) = -\\mu^2\\varphi^{\\dagger}\\varphi + \\lambda \\left( \\varphi^{\\dagger}\\varphi \\right)^2, </math>\nwhere <math>\\mu^2>0</math>, so that <math>\\varphi</math> acquires a non-zero [[Vacuum expectation value]], which generates masses for the Electroweak gauge fields (the Higgs' mechanism), and <math>\\lambda>0</math>, so that the potential is bounded from below. The quartic term describes self-interactions of the scalar field <math>\\varphi</math>.\n\nThe minimum of the potential is degenerate with an infinite number of equivalent [[ground state]] solutions, which occurs when <math>\\varphi^{\\dagger}\\varphi = \\tfrac{\\mu^2}{2\\lambda}</math>. It is possible to perform a [[Unitary gauge|gauge transformation]] on <math>\\varphi</math> such that the ground state is transformed to a basis where <math>\\varphi_1 = \\varphi_2 = \\varphi_4 = 0</math> and <math>\\varphi_3 = \\tfrac{\\mu}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} \\equiv v </math>. This breaks the symmetry of the ground state. The expectation value of <math>\\varphi</math> now becomes \n<math display=\"block\"> \\langle \\varphi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix},</math>\nwhere <math>v</math> has units of mass and sets the scale of electroweak physics. This is the only dimensional parameter of the Standard Model and has a measured value of ~{{val|246|u=GeV/c2}}. \n\nAfter symmetry breaking, the masses of the <math>\\text{W}</math> and <math>\\text{Z}</math> are given by <math>m_\\text{W}=\\frac{1}{2}gv</math> and <math> m_\\text{Z}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{g^2+g'^2}v</math>, which can be viewed as predictions of the theory. The photon remains massless. The mass of the [[Higgs Boson]] is <math>m_\\text{H}=\\sqrt{2\\mu^2}=\\sqrt{2\\lambda}v</math>. Since <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\lambda</math> are free parameters, the Higgs' mass could not be predicted beforehand and had to be determined experimentally.\n\n==== Yukawa sector ====\nThe [[Yukawa interaction]] terms are:\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\mathcal{L}_\\text{Yukawa} = (Y_\\text{u})_{mn}(\\bar{Q}_\\text{L})_m \\tilde{\\varphi}(u_\\text{R})_n + (Y_\\text{d})_{mn}(\\bar{Q}_\\text{L})_m \\varphi(d_\\text{R})_n + (Y_\\text{e})_{mn}(\\bar{\\ell}_\\text{L})_m {\\varphi}(e_\\text{R})_n + \\mathrm{h.c.} </math>\n\nwhere <math>Y_\\text{u}</math>, <math>Y_\\text{d}</math>, and <math>Y_\\text{e}</math> are {{math|3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3}} matrices of Yukawa couplings, with the {{mvar|mn}} term giving the coupling of the generations {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}}, and h.c. means Hermitian conjugate of preceding terms. The fields <math>Q_\\text{L}</math> and <math>\\ell_\\text{L}</math> are left-handed quark and lepton doublets. Likewise, <math>u_\\text{R}, d_\\text{R}</math> and <math>e_\\text{R}</math> are right-handed up-type quark, down-type quark, and lepton singlets. Finally <math>\\varphi</math> is the Higgs doublet and <math>\\tilde{\\varphi} = i\\tau_2\\varphi^{*}</math> is its charge conjugate state.\n\nThe Yukawa terms are invariant under the <math>\\operatorname{SU}(2)_\\text{L} \\times \\operatorname{U}(1)_\\text{Y}</math> gauge symmetry of the Standard Model and generate masses for all fermions after spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n== Fundamental interactions ==\n{{Main|Fundamental interaction}}\nThe Standard Model describes three of the four fundamental interactions in nature; only gravity remains unexplained. In the Standard Model, such an interaction is described as an exchange of [[boson]]s between the objects affected, such as a [[photon]] for the electromagnetic force and a [[gluon]] for the strong interaction. Those particles are called [[force carrier]]s or messenger [[particles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model|title=The Standard Model|website=CERN|date=15 December 2023 }}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" class=\"wikitable floatcenter\"\n|+ '''The four fundamental interactions of nature'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~dfehling/particle.gif |title=Standard Model of Particles and Interactions |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=jhu.edu |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]] |access-date=18 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304133522/https://www.pha.jhu.edu/~dfehling/particle.gif |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>\n! style=\"\" rowspan=\"2\" | Property/Interaction\n! style=\"background-color:#8080BF\" rowspan=\"2\" |Gravitation\n! style=\"background-color:#BFA080\" colspan=\"2\" |Electroweak\n! style=\"background-color:#80BF80\" colspan=\"2\" |Strong\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#BFBF80\" |Weak\n! style=\"background-color:#BF8080\" |Electromagnetic\n! style=\"background-color:#AAD4AA\" |<small>Fundamental</small>\n! style=\"background-color:#D5EAD5\" |<small>Residual</small>\n|-\n|Mediating particles\n| align=\"center\" {{Not yet}} observed<br /><small>([[Graviton]] hypothesised)</small>\n| align=\"center\" |[[W and Z bosons|W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>\u2212</sup> and Z<sup>0</sup>]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[Photon|\u03b3]] (photon)\n| align=\"center\" |Gluons\n| align=\"center\" |[[Pion|\u03c0]], [[Rho meson|\u03c1]] and [[Omega meson|\u03c9]] [[meson]]s\n|-\n|Affected particles\n| align=\"center\" |All particles\n| align=\"center\" |Left-handed [[fermions]]\n| align=\"center\" |Electrically charged\n| align=\"center\" |Quarks, [[gluon]]s\n| align=\"center\" |[[Hadron]]s\n|-\n|Acts on\n| align=\"center\" | [[Stress\u2013energy tensor]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[Flavour (particle physics)|Flavour]]\n| align=\"center\" |Electric charge\n| align=\"center\" |[[Color charge]]\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n|Bound states formed\n| align=\"center\" |Planets, stars, galaxies, galaxy groups\n| align=\"center\" {{n/a}}\n| align=\"center\" |Atoms, molecules\n| align=\"center\" |Hadrons\n| align=\"center\" |Atomic nuclei\n|-\n|Strength at the scale of quarks<br /> (relative to electromagnetism)\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-41}} <small>(predicted)</small>\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-4}}\n| align=\"center\" |1\n| align=\"center\" |60\n| align=\"center\" {{No|Not applicable <br />to quarks}}\n|-\n|Strength at the scale of <br />protons/neutrons <br /> (relative to electromagnetism)\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-36}} <small>(predicted)</small>\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-7}}\n| align=\"center\" |1\n| align=\"center\" {{No|Not applicable <br />to hadrons}}\n| align=\"center\" |20\n|}\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2021}}\n\n=== Gravity ===\n{{See also|Quantum gravity|Gravity}}\n\n[[File:Fundamental Interactions.png|thumb|Fundamental Interactions of the Standard Model including the hypothetical Graviton.]]\n\nDespite being perhaps the most familiar fundamental interaction, gravity is not described by the Standard Model, due to contradictions that arise when combining general relativity, the modern theory of gravity, and quantum mechanics. However, gravity is so weak at microscopic scales, that it is essentially unmeasurable. The graviton is postulated as the mediating particle but has not yet been proved to exist.\n\n=== Electromagnetism ===\n{{See also|Electromagnetism|Quantum electrodynamics}}\nElectromagnetism is the only long-range force in the Standard Model. It is mediated by photons and couples to electric charge.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-12-04 |title=The Standard Model |url=https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model |access-date=2023-12-17 |website=CERN |language=en}}</ref> Electromagnetism is responsible for a wide range of phenomena including [[Electron shell|atomic electron shell structure]], [[chemical bonds]], [[electric circuit]]s and [[electronics]]. Electromagnetic interactions in the Standard Model are described by quantum electrodynamics.\n\n=== Weak nuclear force ===\n{{See also|Weak interaction|Electroweak interaction}}\nThe weak interaction is responsible for various forms of [[particle decay]], such as [[beta decay]]. It is weak and short-range, due to the fact that the weak mediating particles, W and Z bosons, have mass. W bosons have electric charge and mediate interactions that change the particle type (referred to as flavour) and charge. Interactions mediated by W bosons are [[charged current interaction]]s. Z bosons are neutral and mediate neutral current interactions, which do not change particle flavour. Thus Z bosons are similar to the photon, aside from them being massive and interacting with the neutrino. The weak interaction is also the only interaction to violate [[Parity violation|parity]] and [[CP violation|CP]]. Parity violation is maximal for charged current interactions, since the W boson interacts exclusively with left-handed fermions and right-handed antifermions.\n\nIn the Standard Model, the weak force is understood in terms of the electroweak theory, which states that the weak and electromagnetic interactions become united into a single ''electroweak'' interaction at high energies.\n\n=== Strong nuclear force ===\n{{See also|Strong interaction|Nuclear force|Quantum chromodynamics}}\nThe strong nuclear force is responsible for hadronic and [[Nuclear binding energy|nuclear binding]]. It is mediated by gluons, which couple to color charge. Since gluons themselves have color charge, the strong force exhibits [[Color confinement|confinement]] and [[asymptotic freedom]]. Confinement means that only color-neutral particles can exist in isolation, therefore quarks can only exist in hadrons and never in isolation, at low energies. Asymptotic freedom means that the strong force becomes weaker, as the energy scale increases. The strong force overpowers the [[electrostatic]] repulsion of protons and quarks in nuclei and hadrons respectively, at their respective scales.\n\nWhile quarks are bound in hadrons by the fundamental strong interaction, which is mediated by gluons, nucleons are bound by an emergent phenomenon termed the ''residual strong force'' or ''[[nuclear force]]''. This interaction is mediated by mesons, such as the [[pion]]. The color charges inside the nucleon cancel out, meaning most of the gluon and quark fields cancel out outside of the nucleon. However, some residue is \"leaked\", which appears as the exchange of virtual mesons, that causes the attractive force between nucleons.

Inadequacies of the Standard Model that motivate such research include:\n* The model does not explain [[gravitation]], although physical confirmation of a theoretical particle known as a [[graviton]] would account for it to a degree. Though it addresses strong and electroweak interactions, the Standard Model does not consistently explain the canonical theory of gravitation, [[general relativity]], in terms of [[quantum field theory]]. The reason for this is, among other things, that quantum field theories of gravity generally break down before reaching the [[Planck scale]]. As a consequence, we have no reliable theory for the very early universe.\n* Some physicists consider it to be ''ad hoc'' and inelegant, requiring 19 numerical constants whose values are unrelated and arbitrary.<ref name=\"BlumhoferHutter1997\">\n{{cite journal\n |author1=A.
