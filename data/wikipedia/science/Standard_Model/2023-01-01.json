The neutral [[Higgs field]] (gray square) breaks the [[electroweak symmetry]] and interacts with other particles to give them mass.]]\n-->\n\nThe Standard Model includes 12 [[elementary particle]]s of [[Spin (physics)|spin]] {{1/2}}, known as [[fermion]]s. According to the [[spin\u2013statistics theorem]], fermions respect the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Each fermion has a corresponding [[antiparticle]].\n\nFermions are classified according to how they interact (or equivalently, by what [[charge (physics)|charges]] they carry). There are six [[quark]]s ([[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], [[charm quark|charm]], [[strange quark|strange]], [[top quark|top]], [[bottom quark|bottom]]), and six [[lepton]]s ([[electron]], [[electron neutrino]], [[muon]], [[muon neutrino]], [[tau (particle)|tau]], [[tau neutrino]]). Each class is divided into pairs of particles that exhibit a similar physical behavior called a [[Generation (particle physics)|generation]] (see the table).\n\nThe defining property of quarks is that they carry [[color charge]], and hence interact via the [[strong interaction]]. The phenomenon of [[color confinement]] results in quarks being very strongly bound to one another, forming color-neutral composite particles called [[hadron]]s that contain either a quark and an antiquark ([[meson]]s) or three quarks ([[baryon]]s). The lightest baryons are the [[proton]] and the [[neutron]]. Quarks also carry [[electric charge]] and [[weak isospin]]. Hence they interact with other fermions via [[electromagnetism]] and the [[weak interaction]]. The remaining six fermions do not carry color charge and are called leptons. The three [[neutrino]]s do not carry electric charge either, so their motion is directly influenced only by the [[weak interaction|weak nuclear force]] and gravity, which makes them notoriously difficult to detect. By contrast, by virtue of carrying an electric charge, the electron, muon, and tau all interact electromagnetically.\n\nEach member of a generation has greater mass than the corresponding particle of any generation before it. The first-generation charged particles do not decay, hence all ordinary ([[baryon]]ic) matter is made of such particles. Specifically, all atoms consist of electrons orbiting around [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], ultimately constituted of up and down quarks. On the other hand, second- and third-generation charged particles decay with very short half-lives and are observed only in very high-energy environments. Neutrinos of all generations also do not decay, and pervade the universe, but rarely interact with baryonic matter.\n\n=== Gauge bosons ===\n[[File:Standard Model \u2013 All Feynman diagram vertices.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Interactions in the Standard Model.

At a [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic level]], electromagnetism allows particles to interact with one another via [[electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, and gravitation allows particles with mass to attract one another in accordance with Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]]. The Standard Model explains such forces as resulting from matter particles [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|exchanging other particles]], generally referred to as ''force mediating particles''. When a force-mediating particle is exchanged, the effect at a macroscopic level is equivalent to a force influencing both of them, and the particle is therefore said to have ''mediated'' (i.e., been the agent of) that force.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jaeger | first1 = Gregg | year = 2021 | title = Exchange Forces in Particle Physics | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 51 | issue =1 | page = 13 |doi=10.1007/s10701-021-00425-0| bibcode = 2021FoPh...51...13J | s2cid = 231811425 }}</ref> The [[Feynman diagram]] calculations, which are a graphical representation of the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] approximation, invoke \"force mediating particles\", and when applied to analyze [[particle accelerator|high-energy scattering experiments]] are in reasonable agreement with the data. However, perturbation theory (and with it the concept of a \"force-mediating particle\") fails in other situations. These include low-energy [[quantum chromodynamics]], [[bound state]]s, and [[soliton]]s.\n\nThe gauge bosons of the Standard Model all have [[spin (physics)|spin]] (as do matter particles). The value of the spin is 1, making them [[boson]]s. As a result, they do not follow the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] that constrains [[fermion]]s: thus bosons (e.g. photons) do not have a theoretical limit on their [[volume number density|spatial density (number per volume)]]. The types of gauge bosons are described below.\n* [[Photon]]s mediate the electromagnetic force between electrically charged particles. The photon is massless and is well-described by the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]].\n* The [[W and Z bosons|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}, and {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}}]] gauge bosons mediate the [[weak interaction]]s between particles of different [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavours]] (all [[quark]]s and leptons). They are massive, with the {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}} being more massive than the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+-}}. The weak interactions involving the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+-}} act only on [[Chirality (physics)|''left-handed'' particles and ''right-handed'' antiparticles]]. The {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+-}} carries an electric charge of +1 and \u22121 and couples to the electromagnetic interaction. The electrically neutral {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}} boson interacts with both left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles. These three gauge bosons along with the photons are grouped together, as collectively mediating the [[electroweak]] interaction.\n* The eight [[gluon]]s mediate the [[strong interaction]]s between [[color charge]]d particles (the quarks). Gluons are massless. The eightfold multiplicity of gluons is labeled by a combination of color and anticolor charge (e.g. red\u2013antigreen).{{NoteTag|Technically, there are nine such color\u2013anticolor combinations. However, one of these is a color-symmetric combination that can be constructed out of a linear superposition, reducing the count to eight.}} Because gluons have an effective color charge, they can also interact among themselves. Gluons and their interactions are described by the theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]].\n\nThe interactions between all the particles described by the Standard Model are summarized by the diagrams on the right of this section.\n\n=== Higgs boson ===\n{{Main|Higgs boson}}\n\nThe Higgs particle is a massive [[Scalar field theory|scalar]] elementary particle theorized by [[Peter Higgs]] in 1964, when he showed that Goldstone's 1962 theorem (generic continuous symmetry, which is spontaneously broken) provides a third polarisation of a massive vector field. Hence, Goldstone's original scalar doublet, the massive spin-zero particle, was [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|proposed as the Higgs boson]], and is a key building block in the Standard Model.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=G.S.

In particular, the Higgs boson explains why the photon has no mass, while the [[W and Z bosons]] are very heavy. Elementary-particle masses, and the differences between [[electromagnetism]] (mediated by the photon) and the [[weak force]] (mediated by the W and Z bosons), are critical to many aspects of the structure of microscopic (and hence macroscopic) matter. In [[electroweak interaction|electroweak theory]], the Higgs boson generates the masses of the leptons (electron, muon, and tau) and quarks.  As the Higgs boson is massive, it must interact with itself.\n\nBecause the Higgs boson is a very massive particle and also decays almost immediately when created, only a very high-energy [[particle accelerator]] can observe and record it. Experiments to confirm and determine the nature of the Higgs boson using the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at [[CERN]] began in early 2010 and were performed at [[Fermilab]]'s [[Tevatron]] until its closure in late 2011.

It consists of the familiar [[translational symmetry]], [[rotational symmetry]] and the inertial reference frame invariance central to the theory of [[special relativity]]. The [[Local symmetry|local]] SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1) [[gauge symmetry]] is an [[Internal symmetries|internal symmetry]] that essentially defines the Standard Model. Roughly, the three factors of the gauge symmetry give rise to the three fundamental interactions. The fields fall into different [[Representation of a Lie group|representations]] of the various symmetry groups of the Standard Model (see table). Upon writing the most general Lagrangian, one finds that the dynamics depends on 19 parameters, whose numerical values are established by experiment. The parameters are summarized in the table (made visible by clicking \"show\") above.\n\n==== Quantum chromodynamics sector ====\n{{Main|Quantum chromodynamics}}\nThe quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sector defines the interactions between quarks and gluons, which is a [[Yang\u2013Mills theory|Yang\u2013Mills gauge theory]] with SU(3) symmetry, generated by {{mvar|T{{i sup|a}}}}. Since leptons do not interact with gluons, they are not affected by this sector. The Dirac Lagrangian of the quarks coupled to the gluon fields is given by\n<math display=\"block\">\\mathcal{L}_\\text{QCD} = \\sum_\\psi \\overline{\\psi}_i \\left( i\\gamma^\\mu(\\partial_\\mu\\delta_{ij} - i g_s G_\\mu^a T^a_{ij})\\right) \\psi_j - \\frac{1}{4} G^a_{\\mu\\nu} G^{\\mu\\nu}_a,</math>\nwhere\n* {{mvar|\u03c8{{su|b=i}}}} is the Dirac spinor of the quark field, where ''i'' = {r, g, b} represents color,\n* {{mvar|\u03b3{{isup|\u03bc}}}} are the [[Dirac matrices]],\n* {{mvar|G{{su|b=\u03bc|p=a}}}} is the 8-component (<math>a = 1, 2, \\dots, 8</math>) SU(3) gauge field,\n* {{mvar|T{{su|b=ij|p=a}}}} are the 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 [[Gell-Mann matrices]], generators of the SU(3) color group,\n* {{mvar|G{{su|b=\u03bc\u03bd|p=a}}}} represents the [[gluon field strength tensor]],\n* {{mvar|g<sub>s</sub>}} is the strong coupling constant.\n\n==== Electroweak sector ====\n{{Main|Electroweak interaction}}\nThe electroweak sector is a [[Yang\u2013Mills theory|Yang\u2013Mills gauge theory]] with the symmetry group U(1)\u202f\u00d7\u202fSU(2)<sub>L</sub>,\n<math display=\"block\">\\mathcal{L}_\\text{EW} = \\sum_\\psi \\bar\\psi \\gamma^\\mu \\left(i\\partial_\\mu - g' \\tfrac12 Y_\\text{W} B_\\mu - g \\tfrac{1}{2} \\vec\\tau_\\text{L} \\vec W_\\mu\\right)\\psi - \\tfrac{1}{4} W_a^{\\mu\\nu} W_{\\mu\\nu}^a - \\tfrac{1}{4} B^{\\mu\\nu} B_{\\mu\\nu},</math>\nwhere\n* {{mvar|B<sub>\u03bc</sub>}} is the U(1) gauge field,\n* {{math|''Y''<sub>W</sub>}} is the [[weak hypercharge]] \u2013 the generator of the U(1) group,\n* {{math|{{vec|''W''}}<sub>''\u03bc''</sub>}} is the 3-component SU(2) gauge field,\n* {{math|{{vec|''\u03c4''<sub>L</sub>}}}} are the [[Pauli matrices]] \u2013 infinitesimal generators of the SU(2) group \u2013 with subscript L to indicate that they only act on ''left''-chiral fermions,\n* {{mvar|g'}} and {{mvar|g}} are the U(1) and SU(2) coupling constants respectively,\n* <math>W^{a\\mu\\nu}</math> (<math>a = 1, 2, 3</math>) and <math>B^{\\mu\\nu}</math> are the [[field strength tensor]]s for the weak isospin and weak hypercharge fields.\n\nNotice that the addition of fermion mass terms into the electroweak Lagrangian is forbidden, since terms of the form <math>m\\overline\\psi\\psi</math> do not respect U(1)\u202f\u00d7\u202fSU(2)<sub>L</sub> gauge invariance. Neither is it possible to add explicit mass terms for the U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields. The Higgs mechanism is responsible for the generation of the gauge boson masses, and the fermion masses result from Yukawa-type interactions with the Higgs field.\n\n==== Higgs sector ====\n{{Main|Higgs mechanism}}\nIn the Standard Model, the [[Higgs field]] is a complex [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] of the group [[SU(2)]]<sub>L</sub>:\n<math display=\"block\">\\varphi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\varphi^+ \\\\ \\varphi^0 \\end{pmatrix},</math>\nwhere the superscripts + and 0 indicate the electric charge ({{mvar|Q}}) of the components. The weak hypercharge ({{math|''Y''<sub>W</sub>}}) of both components is 1.\n\nBefore symmetry breaking, the Higgs Lagrangian is\n<math display=\"block\">\\mathcal{L}_\\text{H} = \\varphi^\\dagger \\left(\\partial^\\mu - \\frac{i}{2} \\left( g'Y_\\text{W} B^\\mu + g \\vec\\tau \\vec W^\\mu \\right)\\right) \\left(\\partial_\\mu + \\frac{i}{2} \\left( g'Y_\\text{W} B_\\mu + g \\vec\\tau \\vec W_\\mu \\right)\\right)\\varphi - \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4} \\left(\\varphi^\\dagger \\varphi - v^2\\right)^2,</math>\nwhich up to a divergence term, (i.e., after partial integration) can also be written as\n<math display=\"block\">\\mathcal{L}_\\text{H} = \\left|\\left(\\partial_\\mu + \\frac{i}{2} \\left( g'Y_\\text{W} B_\\mu + g \\vec\\tau \\vec W_\\mu \\right)\\right)\\varphi\\right|^2 - \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4} \\left(\\varphi^\\dagger \\varphi - v^2\\right)^2.</math>\n\nThe Higgs self-coupling strength {{mvar|\u03bb}} is approximately {{frac|1|8}}. This is not included in the table above because it can be derived from the mass (after symmetry breaking) and the vacuum expectation value.\n\n==== Yukawa sector ====\nThe [[Yukawa interaction]] terms are\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\mathcal{L}_\\text{Yukawa} = \\overline U_{\\rm L} G_{\\rm u} U_{\\rm R} \\varphi^0 - \\overline D_{\\rm L} G_{\\rm u} U_{\\rm R} \\varphi^- + \\overline U_{\\rm L} G_{\\rm d} D_{\\rm R} \\varphi^+ + \\overline D_{\\rm L} G_{\\rm d} D_{\\rm R} \\varphi^0 + \\mathrm{h.c.},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''G''<sub>u,d</sub>}} are {{math|3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3}} matrices of Yukawa couplings, with the {{mvar|ij}} term giving the coupling of the generations {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}}, and h.c. means Hermitian conjugate of preceding terms.\n\n==Fundamental interactions==\n{{Main|Fundamental interaction}}\nThe Standard Model describes three of the four fundamental interactions in nature; only gravity remains unexplained. In the Standard Model, such an interaction is described as an exchange of [[boson]]s between the objects affected, such as a [[photon]] for the electromagnetic force and a [[gluon]] for the strong interaction. Those particles are called [[force carrier]]s or messenger [[particles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model|title=The Standard Model|website=CERN}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" class=\"wikitable floatcenter\"\n|+ '''The four fundamental interactions of nature'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~dfehling/particle.gif |title=Standard Model of Particles and Interactions |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=jhu.edu |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]] |access-date=18 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304133522/https://www.pha.jhu.edu/~dfehling/particle.gif |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>\n! style=\"\" rowspan=\"2\" | Property/Interaction\n! style=\"background-color:#8080BF\" rowspan=\"2\" |Gravitation\n! style=\"background-color:#BFA080\" colspan=\"2\" |Electroweak\n! style=\"background-color:#80BF80\" colspan=\"2\" |Strong\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#BFBF80\" |Weak\n! style=\"background-color:#BF8080\" |Electromagnetic\n! style=\"background-color:#AAD4AA\" |<small>Fundamental</small>\n! style=\"background-color:#D5EAD5\" |<small>Residual</small>\n|-\n|Mediating particles\n| align=\"center\" {{Not yet}} observed<br /><small>([[Graviton]] hypothesised)</small>\n| align=\"center\" |[[W and Z bosons|W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>\u2212</sup> and Z<sup>0</sup>]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[Photon|\u03b3]] (photon)\n| align=\"center\" |Gluons\n| align=\"center\" |[[Pion|\u03c0]], [[Rho meson|\u03c1]] and [[Omega meson|\u03c9]] [[meson]]s\n|-\n|Affected particles\n| align=\"center\" |All particles\n| align=\"center\" |Left-handed [[fermions]]\n| align=\"center\" |Electrically charged\n| align=\"center\" |Quarks, [[gluon]]s\n| align=\"center\" |[[Hadron]]s\n|-\n|Acts on\n| align=\"center\" | Stress energy tensor\n| align=\"center\" |[[Flavour (particle physics)|Flavour]]\n| align=\"center\" |Electric charge\n| align=\"center\" |[[Color charge]]\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n|Bound states formed\n| align=\"center\" |Planets, stars, galaxies, galaxy groups\n| align=\"center\" {{n/a}}\n| align=\"center\" |Atoms, molecules\n| align=\"center\" |Hadrons\n| align=\"center\" |Atomic nuclei\n|-\n|Strength at the scale of quarks<br /> (relative to electromagnetism)\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-41}} <small>(predicted)</small>\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-4}}\n| align=\"center\" |1\n| align=\"center\" |60\n| align=\"center\" {{No|Not applicable <br />to quarks}}\n|-\n|Strength at the scale of <br />protons/neutrons <br /> (relative to electromagnetism)\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-36}} <small>(predicted)</small>\n| align=\"center\" |{{val||e=-7}}\n| align=\"center\" |1\n| align=\"center\" {{No|Not applicable <br />to hadrons}}\n| align=\"center\" |20\n|}\n\n{{Unsourced section|date=June 2021}}\n\n=== Gravity ===\n{{See also|Quantum gravity|Gravity}}\nDespite being perhaps the most familiar fundamental interaction, gravity is not described by the Standard Model, due to contradictions that arise when combining general relativity, the modern theory of gravity, and quantum mechanics. However, gravity is so weak at microscopic scales, that it is essentially unmeasurable. The graviton is postulated as the mediating particle.\n\n=== Electromagnetism ===\n{{See also|Electromagnetism|Quantum electrodynamics}}\nElectromagnetism is the only long-range force in the Standard Model. It is mediated by photons and couples to electric charge. Electromagnetism is responsible for a wide range of phenomena including [[Electron shell|atomic electron shell structure]], [[chemical bonds]], [[electric circuit]]s and [[electronics]]. Electromagnetic interactions in the Standard Model are described by quantum electrodynamics.\n\n=== Weak nuclear force ===\n{{See also|Weak interaction|Electroweak interaction}}\nThe weak interaction is responsible for various forms of [[particle decay]], such as [[beta decay]]. It is weak and short-range, due to the fact that the weak mediating particles, W and Z bosons, have mass. W bosons have electric charge and mediate interactions that change the particle type (referred to as flavour) and charge. Interactions mediated by W bosons are [[charged current interaction]]s. Z bosons are neutral and mediate neutral current interactions, which do not change particle flavour. Thus Z bosons are similar to the photon, aside from them being massive and interacting with the neutrino. The weak interaction is also the only interaction to violate [[Parity violation|parity]] and [[CP violation|CP]]. Parity violation is maximal for charged current interactions, since the W boson interacts exclusively with left-handed fermions and right-handed antifermions.\n\nIn the Standard Model, the weak force is understood in terms of the electroweak theory, which states that the weak and electromagnetic interactions become united into a single ''electroweak'' interaction at high energies.\n\n=== Strong nuclear force ===\n{{See also|Strong interaction|Nuclear force|Quantum chromodynamics}}\nThe strong nuclear force is responsible for hadronic and [[Nuclear binding energy|nuclear binding]]. It is mediated by gluons, which couple to color charge. Since gluons themselves have color charge, the strong force exhibits [[Color confinement|confinement]] and [[asymptotic freedom]]. Confinement means that only color-neutral particles can exist in isolation, therefore quarks can only exist in hadrons and never in isolation, at low energies. Asymptotic freedom means that the strong force becomes weaker, as the energy scale increases. The strong force overpowers the [[electrostatic]] repulsion of protons and quarks in nuclei and hadrons respectively, at their respective scales.\n\nWhile quarks are bound in hadrons by the fundamental strong interaction, which is mediated by gluons, nucleons are bound by an emergent phenomenon termed the ''residual strong force'' or ''[[nuclear force]]''. This interaction is mediated by mesons, such as the [[pion]]. The color charges inside the nucleon cancel out, meaning most of the gluon and quark fields cancel out outside of the nucleon. However, some residue is \"leaked\", which appears as the exchange of virtual mesons, that causes the attractive force between nucleons. The (fundamental) strong interaction is described by quantum chromodynamics, which is a component of the Standard Model.\n\n== Tests and predictions ==\nThe Standard Model predicted the existence of the [[W and Z bosons]], [[gluon]], [[top quark]] and [[charm quark]], and predicted many of their properties before these particles were observed. The predictions were experimentally confirmed with good precision.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last1=Woithe |first1=Julia |last2=Wiener |first2=Gerfried |last3=Van der Veken |first3=Frederik |title=Let's have a coffee with the Standard Model of particle physics! |journal=Phys.

Though it addresses strong and electroweak interactions, the Standard Model does not consistently explain the canonical theory of gravitation, [[general relativity]], in terms of [[quantum field theory]]. The reason for this is, among other things, that quantum field theories of gravity generally break down before reaching the [[Planck scale]].

Contentions include the absence of an explanation in the Standard Model of particle physics for the observed amount of [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and its contributions to [[dark energy]], which are many orders of magnitude too large. It is also difficult to accommodate the observed predominance of matter over antimatter ([[matter]]/[[antimatter]] [[Baryon asymmetry|asymmetry]]). The [[isotropic|isotropy]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of the visible universe over large distances seems to require a mechanism like cosmic [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], which would also constitute an extension of the Standard Model.\n\nCurrently, no proposed [[theory of everything]] has been widely accepted or verified.\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Yang\u2013Mills theory]]\n* [[Fundamental interaction]]:\n** [[Quantum electrodynamics]]\n** [[Strong interaction]]: [[Color charge]], [[Quantum chromodynamics]], [[Quark model]]\n** [[Weak interaction]]: [[Electroweak interaction]], [[Fermi's interaction]], [[Weak hypercharge]], [[Weak isospin]]\n* [[Gauge theory]]: [[Introduction to gauge theory]]\n* [[Generation (particle physics)|Generation]]\n* [[Higgs mechanism]]: [[Higgs boson]], [[Alternatives to the Standard Higgs Model]]\n* [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]\n* Open questions: [[CP violation]], [[Neutrino mass]]es, [[QCD matter]], [[Quantum triviality]]\n* [[Quantum field theory]]\n* Standard Model: [[Mathematical formulation of the Standard Model|Mathematical formulation of]], [[Physics beyond the Standard Model]]\n* [[Electron electric dipole moment]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book\n | author=R.
