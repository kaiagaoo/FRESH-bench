A cosmological constant would remain constant across time and space, while scalar fields can vary. Yet other possibilities are interacting dark energy, an observational effect, and cosmological coupling (see the [[Dark_energy#Theories_of_dark_energy|Theories of Dark Energy]] section).\n\n==History of discovery and previous speculation==\n\n===Einstein's cosmological constant===\nThe \"[[cosmological constant]]\" is a constant term that can be added to [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]]. If considered as a \"source term\" in the field equation, it can be viewed as equivalent to the mass of empty space (which conceptually could be either positive or negative), or \"[[vacuum energy]]\".\n\nThe cosmological constant was first proposed by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] as a mechanism to obtain a solution to the gravitational [[field equation]] that would lead to a static universe, effectively using dark energy to balance gravity.<ref name=\"Einstein\">{{Cite arXiv |eprint=1211.6338 |class=physics.hist-ph |author=Harvey, Alex |title=How Einstein Discovered Dark Energy |year=2012}}</ref> Einstein gave the cosmological constant the symbol \u039b (capital lambda). Einstein stated that the cosmological constant required that 'empty space takes the role of gravitating [[negative mass]]es which are distributed all over the interstellar space'.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Volume 7: The Berlin Years: Writings, 1918-1921 (English translation supplement) page 31 |url=https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol7-trans/47 |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu}}</ref><ref>O'Raifeartaigh, C.; O'Keeffe, M.; Nahm, W.; Mitton, S.

The [[dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe which contracts slightly will continue contracting. According to Einstein, \"empty space\" can possess its own energy. Because this energy is a property of space itself, it would not be diluted as space expands. As more space comes into existence, more of this energy-of-space would appear, thereby causing accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Dark Energy, Dark Matter | website=Science Mission Directorate | url=https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy | access-date=September 17, 2022 | archive-date=5 November 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201105231926/https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy/ | url-status=dead }}</ref> These sorts of disturbances are inevitable, due to the uneven distribution of matter throughout the universe. Further, observations made by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929 showed that the universe appears to be expanding and is not static. Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to predict the idea of a dynamic universe, in contrast to a static universe, as his greatest blunder.<ref>Gamow, George (1970) ''My World Line: An Informal Autobiography''. p. 44: \"Much later, when I was discussing cosmological problems with Einstein, he remarked that the introduction of the cosmological term was the biggest blunder he ever made in his life.\" \u2013 Here the \"cosmological term\" refers to the cosmological constant in the equations of general relativity, whose value Einstein initially picked to ensure that his model of the universe would neither expand nor contract; if he had not done this he might have theoretically predicted the universal expansion that was first observed by Edwin Hubble.</ref>\n\n===Inflationary dark energy===\n[[Alan Guth]] and [[Alexei Starobinsky]] proposed in 1980 that a negative pressure field, similar in concept to dark energy, could drive [[cosmic inflation]] in the very early universe. Inflation postulates that some repulsive force, qualitatively similar to dark energy, resulted in an enormous and exponential expansion of the universe slightly after the [[Big Bang]]. Such expansion is an essential feature of most current models of the Big Bang. However, inflation must have occurred at a much higher (negative) energy density than the dark energy we observe today, and inflation is thought to have completely ended when the universe was just a fraction of a second old. It is unclear what relation, if any, exists between dark energy and inflation. Even after inflationary models became accepted, the cosmological constant was thought to be irrelevant to the current universe.\n\nNearly all inflation models predict that the total (matter+energy) density of the universe should be very close to the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]. During the 1980s, most cosmological research focused on models with critical density in matter only, usually 95% [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and 5% ordinary matter (baryons). These models were found to be successful at forming realistic galaxies and clusters, but some problems appeared in the late 1980s: in particular, the model required a value for the [[Hubble constant]] lower than preferred by observations, and the model under-predicted observations of large-scale galaxy clustering. These difficulties became stronger after the discovery of [[anisotropy]] in the cosmic microwave background by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] spacecraft in 1992, and several modified CDM models came under active study through the mid-1990s: these included the [[Lambda-CDM model]] and a mixed cold/hot dark matter model. The first direct evidence for dark energy came from supernova observations in 1998 of [[deceleration parameter|accelerated expansion]] in [[Adam Riess|Riess]] ''et al.''<ref name=\"riess\" /> and in [[Saul Perlmutter|Perlmutter]] ''et al.'',<ref name=\"perlmutter\" /> and the Lambda-CDM model then became the leading model. Soon after, dark energy was supported by independent observations: in 2000, the [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]] and [[Millimeter Anisotropy eXperiment IMaging Array|Maxima]] cosmic microwave background experiments observed the first [[Baryon acoustic oscillations|acoustic peak]] in the cosmic microwave background, showing that the total (matter+energy) density is close to 100% of critical density. Then in 2001, the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] gave strong evidence that the matter density is around 30% of critical. The large difference between these two supports a smooth component of dark energy making up the difference. Much more precise measurements from [[WMAP]] in 2003\u20132010 have continued to support the standard model and give more accurate measurements of the key parameters.\n\nThe term \"dark energy\", echoing [[Fritz Zwicky]]'s \"dark matter\" from the 1930s, was coined by [[Michael S. Turner]] in 1998.<ref>The first appearance of the term \"dark energy\" is in the article with another cosmologist and Turner's student at the time, Dragan Huterer, \"Prospects for Probing the Dark Energy via Supernova Distance Measurements\", which was posted to the [[ArXiv.org e-print archive]] in [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9808133 August 1998] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622171956/https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9808133 |date=22 June 2017 }} and published in {{Cite journal |last1=Huterer |first1=D. |last2=Turner |first2=M. |year=1999 |title=Prospects for probing the dark energy via supernova distance measurements |journal=Physical Review D |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=081301 |arxiv=astro-ph/9808133 |bibcode=1999PhRvD..60h1301H |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.60.081301|s2cid=12777640 }}, although the manner in which the term is treated there suggests it was already in general use.

In general relativity, the evolution of the expansion rate is estimated from the [[shape of the universe|curvature of the universe]] and the cosmological [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] (the relationship between temperature, pressure, and combined matter, energy, and vacuum energy density for any region of space). Measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today. Adding the cosmological constant to cosmology's standard [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|FLRW metric]] leads to the Lambda-CDM model, which has been referred to as the \"''standard model of cosmology''\" because of its precise agreement with observations.\n\nAs of 2013, the Lambda-CDM model is consistent with a series of increasingly rigorous cosmological observations, including the [[Planck spacecraft]] and the Supernova Legacy Survey. First results from the SNLS reveal that the average behavior (i.e., equation of state) of dark energy behaves like Einstein's cosmological constant to a precision of 10%.<ref name=\"snls\">{{Cite journal |last1=Astier, Pierre ([[Supernova Legacy Survey]]) |last2=Guy |last3=Regnault |last4=Pain |last5=Aubourg |last6=Balam |last7=Basa |last8=Carlberg |last9=Fabbro |last10=Fouchez |last11=Hook |display-authors=29 |year=2006 |title=The Supernova legacy survey: Measurement of \u03a9<sub>M</sub>, \u03a9<sub>\u039b</sub> and W from the first year data set |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=447 |issue=1 |pages=31\u201348 |arxiv=astro-ph/0510447 |bibcode=2006A&A...447...31A |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20054185 |last12=Howell |last13=Lafoux |last14=Neill |last15=Palanque-Delabrouille |last16=Perrett |last17=Pritchet |last18=Rich |last19=Sullivan |last20=Taillet |last21=Aldering |last22=Antilogus |last23=Arsenijevic |last24=Balland |last25=Baumont |last26=Bronder |last27=Courtois |last28=Ellis |last29=Filiol |last30=Gon\u00e7alves|s2cid=119344498 }}</ref> Recent results from the Hubble Space Telescope Higher-Z Team indicate that dark energy has been present for at least 9 billion years and during the period preceding cosmic acceleration.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}\n\n==Nature==\nThe nature of dark energy is more hypothetical than that of dark matter, and many things about it remain in the realm of speculation.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |date=22 July 2003 |title=Astronomers Report Evidence of 'Dark Energy' Splitting the Universe |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/22/us/astronomers-report-evidence-of-dark-energy-splitting-the-universe.html |access-date=5 August 2015 |archive-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626222313/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/22/us/astronomers-report-evidence-of-dark-energy-splitting-the-universe.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Dark energy is thought to be very homogeneous and not [[density|dense]], and is not known to interact through any of the [[fundamental forces]] other than [[gravity]].

The reason dark energy can have such a profound effect on the universe, making up 68% of universal density in spite of being so dilute, is that it is believed to uniformly fill otherwise empty space.\n\nThe [[vacuum energy]], that is, the particle-antiparticle pairs generated and mutually annihilated within a time frame in accord with Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] in the energy-time formulation, has been often invoked as the main contribution to dark energy.<ref>{{cite journal\n |year         = 2002\n |title        = The quantum vacuum and the cosmological constant problem\n |url          = http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/398/\n |journal      = Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics\n |volume       = 33\n |pages        = 663\u2013705\n |doi          = 10.1016/S1355-2198(02)00033-3\n |issue        = 4\n |bibcode      = 2002SHPMP..33..663R\n |arxiv        = hep-th/0012253\n |s2cid        = 9007190\n |last1        = Rugh\n |first1       = S.E.\n |last2        = Zinkernagel\n |first2       = H.\n |access-date  = 29 October 2022\n |archive-date = 30 November 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101130161201/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/398/\n |url-status   = live\n}}</ref> The [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] postulated by [[general relativity]] implies that the vacuum energy should exert a [[gravity|gravitational]] force. Hence, the vacuum energy is expected to contribute to the [[cosmological constant]], which in turn impinges on the accelerated [[expansion of the universe]]. However, the [[cosmological constant problem]] asserts that there is a huge disagreement between the observed values of vacuum energy density and the theoretical large value of zero-point energy obtained by [[quantum field theory]]; the problem remains unresolved.\n\nIndependently of its actual nature, dark energy would need to have a strong negative pressure to explain the observed [[accelerating universe|acceleration]] of the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]]. According to general relativity, the pressure within a substance contributes to its gravitational attraction for other objects just as its mass density does. This happens because the physical quantity that causes matter to generate gravitational effects is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]], which contains both the energy (or matter) density of a substance and its pressure. In the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric]], it can be shown that a strong constant negative pressure (''i.e.,'' tension) in all the universe causes an acceleration in the expansion if the universe is already expanding, or a deceleration in contraction if the universe is already contracting. This accelerating expansion effect is sometimes labeled \"gravitational repulsion\".\n\n===Technical definition===\n{{See also|Friedmann equations}}\nIn standard cosmology, there are three components of the universe: matter, radiation, and dark energy. Matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the scale factor, i.e., {{math|''\u03c1''&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''a''<sup>\u22123</sup>}}, while radiation is anything which scales to the inverse fourth power of the scale factor ({{math|''\u03c1''&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''a''<sup>\u22124</sup>}}). This can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a cube-shaped box, doubling the length of an edge of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (2<sup>3</sup>). For radiation, the decrease in energy density is greater, because an increase in spatial distance also causes a redshift.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Baumann |first=Daniel |title=Cosmology: Part III Mathematical Tripos, Cambridge University |url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/Cosmology/Lectures.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202065045/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/Cosmology/Lectures.pdf |archive-date=2 February 2017 |access-date=31 January 2017 |page=21\u221222}}</ref>\n\nThe final component is dark energy: it is an intrinsic property of space and has a constant energy density, regardless of the dimensions of the volume under consideration ({{math|''\u03c1''&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''a''<sup>0</sup>}}).

They allow researchers to measure the expansion history of the universe by looking at the relationship between the distance to an object and its [[redshift]], which gives how fast it is receding from us. The relationship is roughly linear, according to [[Hubble's law]]. It is relatively easy to measure redshift, but finding the distance to an object is more difficult. Usually, astronomers use standard candles: objects for which the intrinsic brightness, or [[absolute magnitude]], is known. This allows the object's distance to be measured from its actual observed brightness, or [[apparent magnitude]]. Type Ia supernovae are the best-known standard candles across cosmological distances because of their extreme and consistent [[luminosity]].\n\nRecent observations of supernovae are consistent with a universe made up 71.3% of dark energy and 27.4% of a combination of [[dark matter]] and [[Baryon|baryonic matter]].<ref name=\"Kowalski2008\">{{Cite journal |last1=Kowalski |first1=Marek |last2=Rubin, David |last3=Aldering |first3=G. |last4=Agostinho |first4=R.

In order for it not to clump and form [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|structure]] like matter, the field must be very light so that it has a large [[Compton wavelength]]. In the simplest scenarios, the quintessence field has a canonical kinetic term, is minimally coupled to gravity, and does not feature higher order operations in its Lagrangian.\n\nNo evidence of quintessence is yet available, nor has it been ruled out. It generally predicts a slightly slower acceleration of the expansion of the universe than the cosmological constant. Some scientists think that the best evidence for quintessence would come from violations of Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] and [[equivalence principle#Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle|variation of the fundamental constants]] in space or time.<ref name=\"Carroll1998\">{{Cite journal |last=Carroll |first=Sean M. |year=1998 |title=Quintessence and the Rest of the World: Suppressing Long-Range Interactions |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=81 |issue=15 |pages=3067\u20133070 |arxiv=astro-ph/9806099 |bibcode=1998PhRvL..81.3067C |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.3067 |s2cid=14539052 |issn=0031-9007}}</ref> [[Scalar field]]s are predicted by the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics and [[string theory]], but an analogous problem to the cosmological constant problem (or the problem of constructing models of [[cosmological inflation]]) occurs: [[renormalization]] theory predicts that scalar fields should acquire large masses.\n\nThe coincidence problem asks why the [[accelerating universe|acceleration]] of the Universe began when it did. If acceleration began earlier in the universe, structures such as [[galaxy|galaxies]] would never have had time to form, and life, at least as we know it, would never have had a chance to exist. Proponents of the [[anthropic principle]] view this as support for their arguments. However, many models of quintessence have a so-called \"tracker\" behavior, which solves this problem. In these models, the quintessence field has a density which closely tracks (but is less than) the radiation density until [[Big Bang|matter\u2013radiation equality]], which triggers quintessence to start behaving as dark energy, eventually dominating the universe. This naturally sets the low [[energy scale]] of the dark energy.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ratra |first1=Bharat |last2=Peebles |first2=P. J.

The idea is that if one requires the [[Kerr metric]] (which describes rotating black holes) to asymptote to the [[Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric]] (which describes the [[isotropic]] and [[homogeneous]] universe that is the basic assumption of modern cosmology), then one finds that black holes gain mass as the universe expands. The rate is measured to be {{math|\u221d''a''<sup>3</sup>}}, where ''a'' is the [[scale factor]]. This particular rate means that the energy density of black holes remains constant over time, mimicking dark energy (see [[Dark_energy#Technical_definition]]). The theory is called \"cosmological coupling\" because the black holes couple to a cosmological requirement.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wait...

The density of dark matter in an expanding universe decreases more quickly than dark energy, and eventually the dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the volume of the universe doubles, the density of [[dark matter]] is halved, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant in the case of a cosmological constant).\n\nProjections into the future can differ radically for different models of dark energy.
