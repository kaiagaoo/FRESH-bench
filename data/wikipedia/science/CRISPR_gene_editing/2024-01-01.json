It is based on a simplified version of the bacterial [[CRISPR]]-[[Cas9]] antiviral defense system. By delivering the Cas9 [[nuclease]] complexed with a synthetic [[guide RNA]] (gRNA) into a cell, the cell's genome can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed and/or new ones added ''[[in vivo]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bak RO, Gomez-Ospina N, Porteus MH | title = Gene Editing on Center Stage | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 600\u2013611 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 29908711 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2018.05.004 | s2cid = 49269023 }}</ref>\n\nThe technique is considered highly significant in [[biotechnology]] and [[medicine]] as it enables editing genomes ''in vivo'' very precisely, cheaply, and easily.

Knock-in mutations, facilitated via [[homology directed repair]] (HDR), is the traditional pathway of targeted genomic editing approaches.<ref name=\":0\" /> This allows for the introduction of targeted [[DNA repair|DNA damage and repair]]. HDR employs the use of similar DNA sequences to drive the repair of the break via the incorporation of exogenous DNA to function as the repair template.<ref name=\":0\" /> This method relies on the periodic and isolated occurrence of DNA damage at the target site in order for the repair to commence. Knock-out mutations caused by CRISPR-Cas9 result from the repair of the double-stranded break by means of [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ) or [[POLQ|POLQ/ polymerase theta]]-mediated end-joining (TMEJ). These end-joining pathways can often result in random deletions or insertions at the repair site, which may disrupt or alter gene functionality. Therefore, genomic engineering by CRISPR-Cas9 gives researchers the ability to generate targeted random gene disruption. Because of this, the precision of genome editing is a great concern. Genomic editing leads to irreversible changes to the genome.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}\n\nWhile [[genome editing]] in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]] has been possible using various methods since the 1980s, the methods employed had proven to be inefficient and impractical to implement on a large scale. With the discovery of CRISPR and specifically the Cas9 nuclease molecule, efficient and highly selective editing became possible. Cas9 derived from the bacterial species ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' has facilitated targeted genomic modification in eukaryotic cells by allowing for a reliable method of creating a targeted break at a specific location as designated by the crRNA and tracrRNA guide strands.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang JH, Pandey M, Kahler JF, Loshakov A, Harris B, Dagur PK, Mo YY, Simonds WF | display-authors = 6 | title = Improving the specificity and efficacy of CRISPR/CAS9 and gRNA through target specific DNA reporter | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 189 | pages = 1\u20138 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25193712 | pmc = 4252756 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.08.033 }}</ref> The ease with which researchers can insert Cas9 and template RNA in order to [[gene silencing|silence]] or cause [[point mutation]]s at specific [[locus (genetics)|loci]] has proven to be invaluable to the quick and efficient [[gene mapping|mapping]] of genomic models and biological processes associated with various genes in a variety of eukaryotes.

ZFNs has a higher precision and the advantage of being smaller than Cas9, but ZFNs are not as commonly used as CRISPR-based methods. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called [[transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require the design and creation of a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a much more difficult and time-consuming process than that of designing guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires synthesizing only a short RNA sequence, a procedure that is already widely used for many other molecular biology techniques (e.g. creating [[oligonucleotide]] [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]]).<ref name=\"MIT\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Young S | date=11 February 2014 |title= CRISPR and Other Genome Editing Tools Boost Medical Research and Gene Therapy's Reach |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/review/524451/genome-surgery|access-date=2014-04-13 |journal=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}</ref>\n\nWhereas methods such as [[RNA interference]] (RNAi) do not fully suppress gene function, CRISPR, [[Zinc finger nuclease|ZFNs]], and [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]] provide full irreversible [[gene knockout]].<ref name=\"Heidenreich_2016\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidenreich M, Zhang F | title = Applications of CRISPR-Cas systems in neuroscience | journal = Nature Reviews.

Specifically, the research aimed at improving this system includes improving its specificity, its efficiency, and the granularity of its editing power. Techniques can further be divided and classified by the component of the system they modify. These include using a different variants or novel creations of the Cas protein, using an altogether different effector protein, modifying the sgRNA, or using an algorithmic approach to identify existing optimal solutions.\n\nSpecificity is an important aspect to improve the CRISPR-Cas9 system because the off-target effects it generates have serious consequences for the genome of the cell and invokes caution for its use. Minimizing off-target effects is thus maximizing the safety of the system. Novel variations of Cas9 proteins that increase specificity include effector proteins with comparable efficiency and specificity to the original SpCas9 that are able to target the previously untargetable sequences and a variant that has virtually no off-target mutations.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cui Z, Tian R, Huang Z, Jin Z, Li L, Liu J, Huang Z, Xie H, Liu D, Mo H, Zhou R, Lang

Beyond this worry, significant ethical and societal concerns are raised due to access. Socioeconomic factors create a barrier to entry as to who can use the technology to \"edit\" their baby. Gene editing therapy isn't expected to be cheap, and neither is it for the any of the applications mentioned previously. While applications mentioned previously might have medical uses, specifically using gene editing for traits such as intelligence, physical appearance, and athletic ability would lead to a society where enhanced individuals have distinct advantages over those who aren't. This would further widen the gap between the rich and the poor.\n\nThe creation of designer babies could also lead to new form of racism and genetic discrimination. If parents can select which traits they want, they might opt out of certain ethnic features that are considered undesirable in society, and others that are. The presence of Eurocentric features dominating the universal beauty standard means these might be selected for.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sekayi |first=Dia |date=2003 |title=Aesthetic Resistance to Commercial Influences: The Impact of the Eurocentric Beauty Standard on Black College Women |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3211197 |journal=The Journal of Negro Education |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=467\u2013477 |doi=10.2307/3211197 |jstor=3211197 |issn=0022-2984}}</ref> These would reinforce harmful stereotypes and lad to a new kind of racism, based on genetics that express \"desirable features\" that potentially pertain to a ingle race.\n\nThe ability to edit out undesirable traits can also contribute to ableism, a form of discrimination that favors able-bodied individuals. If traits such as physical disabilities can be edited out, this would lead to a society that devalues and stigmatizes those with disabilities. Treating those with such issues as something that needs to be fixed, potentially by CRISPR gene editing, ignores the diversity they bring to society on a physical, and intellectual level. Mental illnesses that are often labeled as a disability lead to individuals with unique traits that often produce prodigies within the arts.\n\nThe promise of eliminating genetic diseases via designer babies raises significant ethical and societal concerns. As we move forward with this technology, it is crucial we weigh the implications and prevent the exacerbation of inequality, racism, and ableism.\n\n=== Policy barriers to genetic engineering ===\nPolicy regulations for the CRISPR-Cas9 system vary around the globe. In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify [[human embryo]]s by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques. However, researchers were forbidden from implanting the embryos and the embryos were to be destroyed after seven days.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Callaway E | title = UK scientists gain licence to edit genes in human embryos | journal = Nature | volume = 530 | issue = 7588 | pages = 18 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26842037 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2016.19270 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2016Natur.530...18C }}</ref>\n\nThe US has an elaborate, interdepartmental regulatory system to evaluate new genetically modified foods and crops.
