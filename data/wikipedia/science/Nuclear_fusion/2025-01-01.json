The formation of nuclei with masses up to [[iron-56]] releases energy, as illustrated above. ]]\n{{Nuclear physics}}\n\n'''Nuclear fusion''' is a [[nuclear reaction|reaction]] in which two or more [[atomic nuclei]] (for example, nuclei of hydrogen [[isotopes]] [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]]), combine to form one or more atomic nuclei and [[neutrons]]. The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[energy]]. This difference in mass arises as a result of the difference in [[nuclear binding energy]] between the atomic nuclei before and after the fusion reaction. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers active or [[main-sequence star]]s and other [[Absolute magnitude|high-magnitude]] stars, where [[Proton\u2013proton chain reaction|large amounts of energy are released]].\n\nA nuclear fusion process that produces atomic nuclei lighter than [[iron-56]] or [[nickel-62]] will generally release energy. These elements have a relatively small mass and a relatively large [[binding energy]] per [[nucleon]]. Fusion of nuclei lighter than these releases energy (an [[exothermic]] process), while the fusion of heavier nuclei results in energy retained by the product nucleons, and the resulting reaction is [[endothermic]]. The opposite is true for the reverse process, called [[nuclear fission]]. Nuclear fusion uses lighter elements, such as hydrogen and [[helium]], which are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as [[uranium]], [[thorium]] and [[plutonium]], are more fissionable. The extreme [[astrophysical]] event of a [[supernova]] can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into [[Chemical element|elements]] heavier than iron.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Timeline of nuclear fusion}}\nAmerican chemist [[William Draper Harkins]] was the first to propose the concept of nuclear fusion in 1915.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal\n|author=Robert S.

Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass of the star (and therefore the pressure and temperature in its core).\n\nAround 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.<ref name=eddington>{{cite journal |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |first=A.

But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.\n# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. \n# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a helium atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom (according to the then-prevailing theory of atomic structure which held atomic weight to be the distinguishing property between elements; work by [[Henry Moseley]] and [[Antonius van den Broek]] would later show that nucleic charge was the distinguishing property and that a helium nucleus, therefore, consisted of two hydrogen nuclei plus additional mass). This suggested that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.\n# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (It is now known that most 'ordinary' stars are usually made of around 70% to 75% hydrogen)\n# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the \"crucible\" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.\n\nAll of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.\n\nThe primary source of solar energy, and that of similar size stars, is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium (the [[proton\u2013proton chain]] reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14&nbsp;million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four [[proton]]s into one [[alpha particle]], with the release of two [[positron]]s and two [[neutrino]]s (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the [[CNO cycle]] and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs when a more massive star undergoes a violent [[supernova]] at the end of its life, a process known as [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].\n\n==Requirements==\n{{more citations|date=October 2024}}\nA substantial energy barrier of electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one another because of the repulsive [[electrostatic force]] between their [[electric charge|positively charged]] protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the quantum effect in which nuclei can [[quantum tunnelling#Nuclear fusion|tunnel]] through coulomb forces.\n\nWhen a [[nucleon]] such as a [[proton]] or [[neutron]] is added to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it to all the other nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but primarily to its immediate neighbors due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface-area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the [[nuclear force]] generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is important to keep in mind that nucleons are [[Quantum physics|quantum objects]]. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.\n\nThe electrostatic force, on the other hand, is an [[inverse square law|inverse-square force]], so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion from ''all'' the other protons in the nucleus. The electrostatic energy per nucleon due to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei atomic number grows.\n\n[[File:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|left|350px|thumb|The [[electrostatic force]] between the positively charged nuclei is repulsive, but when the separation is small enough, the quantum effect will tunnel through the wall. Therefore, the prerequisite for fusion is that the two nuclei be brought close enough together for a long enough time for quantum tunneling to act.]]\n\nThe net result of the opposing electrostatic and strong nuclear forces is that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and then decreases for heavier nuclei. Eventually, the [[binding energy]] becomes negative and very heavy nuclei (all with more than 208 nucleons, corresponding to a diameter of about 6 nucleons) are not stable. The four most tightly bound nuclei, in decreasing order of [[binding energy]] per nucleon, are {{SimpleNuclide|link=yes|Nickel|62}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link=yes|Iron|58}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link=yes|Iron|56}}, and {{SimpleNuclide|link=yes|Nickel|60}}.<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin2.html#c1 The Most Tightly Bound Nuclei] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514050922/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin2.html#c1 |date=14 May 2011 }}. Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu. Retrieved 17 August 2011.</ref> Even though the [[isotopes of nickel|nickel isotope]], {{SimpleNuclide|link=yes|Nickel|62}}, is more stable, the [[isotopes of iron|iron isotope]] {{SimpleNuclide|link=yes|Iron|56}} is an [[order of magnitude]] more common. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way for stars to create {{SimpleNuclide|link=yes|Nickel|62}} through the [[alpha process]].\n\nAn exception to this general trend is the [[helium-4]] nucleus, whose binding energy is higher than that of [[lithium]], the next heavier element. This is because protons and neutrons are [[fermion]]s, which according to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron's energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons (it is a [[doubly magic]] nucleus), so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states. Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single quantum mechanical particle in nuclear physics, namely, the [[alpha particle]].\n\nThe situation is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come close enough for long enough so the strong attractive [[nuclear force]] can take over and overcome the repulsive electrostatic force. This can also be described as the nuclei overcoming the so-called [[Coulomb barrier]]. The kinetic energy to achieve this can be lower than the barrier itself because of quantum tunneling.\n\nThe [[Coulomb barrier]] is smallest for isotopes of hydrogen, as their nuclei contain only a single positive charge. A [[diproton]] is not stable, so neutrons must also be involved, ideally in such a way that a helium nucleus, with its extremely tight binding, is one of the products.\n\nUsing [[Tritium#Deuterium|deuterium\u2013tritium]] fuel, the resulting energy barrier is about 0.1&nbsp;MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an [[electron]] from [[hydrogen]] is 13.6&nbsp;eV. The (intermediate) result of the fusion is an unstable <sup>5</sup>He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1&nbsp;MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining <sup>4</sup>He nucleus is 3.5&nbsp;MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6&nbsp;MeV. This is many times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.\n\n[[File:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]\n\nThe reaction [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] (\u03c3) is a measure of the probability of a fusion reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei. If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, e.g. a thermal distribution, then it is useful to perform an average over the distributions of the product of cross-section and velocity. This average is called the 'reactivity', denoted {{math|{{angbr|''\u03c3v''}}}}. The reaction rate (fusions per volume per time) is {{math|{{angbr|''\u03c3v''}}}} times the product of the reactant number densities:\n\n:<math>f = n_1 n_2 \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle.</math>\n\nIf a species of nuclei is reacting with a nucleus like itself, such as the DD reaction, then the product <math>n_1n_2</math> must be replaced by <math>n^2/2</math>.\n\n<math>\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle</math> increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of [[1 E-15 J|10]]\u2013[[1 E-14 J|100]]&nbsp;keV. At these temperatures, well above typical [[ion]]ization energies (13.6&nbsp;eV in the hydrogen case), the fusion reactants exist in a [[Plasma physics|plasma]] state.\n\nThe significance of <math>\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle</math> as a function of temperature in a device with a particular energy [[confinement time]] is found by considering the [[Lawson criterion]]. This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current advanced technical state.<ref name=lawson>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/5763/20130323/lawson-criteria-make-fusion-power-viable-iter.htm|title=What Is The Lawson Criteria, Or How to Make Fusion Power Viable|first=Science World|last=Report|date=23 March 2013|website=Science World Report|access-date=14 March 2021|archive-date=3 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210803184652/https://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/5763/20130323/lawson-criteria-make-fusion-power-viable-iter.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Artificial fusion ==\n{{main article|Fusion power}}\n\n=== Thermonuclear fusion ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2023}}\nThermonuclear fusion is the process of atomic nuclei combining or \"fusing\" using high temperatures to drive them close enough together for this to become possible. Such temperatures cause the matter to become a [[plasma physics|plasma]] and, if confined, fusion reactions may occur due to collisions with extreme thermal kinetic energies of the particles. There are two forms of thermonuclear fusion: ''uncontrolled'', in which the resulting energy is released in an uncontrolled manner, as it is in [[thermonuclear weapon]]s (\"hydrogen bombs\") and in most [[star]]s; and ''controlled'', where the fusion reactions take place in an environment allowing some or all of the energy released to be harnessed for constructive purposes.\n\nTemperature is a measure of the average [[kinetic energy]] of particles, so by heating the material it will gain energy. After reaching sufficient temperature, given by the [[Lawson criterion]], the energy of accidental collisions within the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is high enough to overcome the [[Coulomb barrier]] and the particles may fuse together.\n\nIn a [[Deuterium\u2013tritium fusion|deuterium\u2013tritium fusion reaction]], for example, the energy necessary to overcome the [[Coulomb barrier]] is 0.1&nbsp;[[Electronvolt|MeV]]. Converting between energy and temperature shows that the 0.1 MeV barrier would be overcome at a temperature [[Orders of magnitude (temperature)|in excess of 1.2 billion]] [[kelvin]].\n\nThere are two effects that are needed to lower the actual temperature. One is the fact that [[temperature]] is the ''average'' kinetic energy, implying that some nuclei at this temperature would actually have much higher energy than 0.1&nbsp;MeV, while others would be much lower. It is the nuclei in the high-energy tail of the [[Distribution function (physics)|velocity distribution]] that account for most of the fusion reactions. The other effect is [[quantum tunnelling]]. The nuclei do not actually have to have enough energy to overcome the Coulomb barrier completely. If they have nearly enough energy, they can tunnel through the remaining barrier. For these reasons fuel at lower temperatures will still undergo fusion events, at a lower rate.\n\n''Thermonuclear'' fusion is one of the methods being researched in the attempts to produce [[fusion power]]. If thermonuclear fusion becomes favorable to use, it would significantly reduce the world's [[carbon footprint]].\n\n===Beam\u2013beam or beam\u2013target fusion===\n{{main|Colliding beam fusion}}\n\nAccelerator-based light-ion fusion is a technique using [[particle accelerator]]s to achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient to induce light-ion fusion reactions.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-62308-1 |title=Accelerator Technology |series=Particle Acceleration and Detection |year=2020 |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-62308-1 |isbn=978-3-030-62307-4 |s2cid=229610872 |last1=M\u00f6ller |first1=S\u00f6ren |access-date=20 September 2022 |archive-date=23 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220923225830/https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-62308-1 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAccelerating light ions is relatively easy, and can be done in an efficient manner\u2014requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} The system can be arranged to accelerate ions into a static fuel-infused target, known as ''beam\u2013target'' fusion, or by accelerating two streams of ions towards each other, ''beam\u2013beam'' fusion.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross-sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube [[neutron generator]]s are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}\n\nA number of attempts to recirculate the ions that \"miss\" collisions have been made over the years. One of the better-known attempts in the 1970s was [[Migma]], which used a unique particle [[storage ring]] to capture ions into circular orbits and return them to the reaction area. Theoretical calculations made during funding reviews pointed out that the system would have significant difficulty scaling up to contain enough fusion fuel to be relevant as a power source. In the 1990s, a new arrangement using a [[field-reversed configuration]] (FRC) as the storage system was proposed by [[Norman Rostoker]] and continues to be studied by [[TAE Technologies]] {{as of|2021|lc=yes}}. A closely related approach is to merge two FRC's rotating in opposite directions,<ref>J. Slough, G. Votroubek, and C.

Due to the high temperature, the plasma cannot be in direct contact with any solid material, so it has to be located in a [[vacuum]]. Also, high temperatures imply high pressures. The plasma tends to expand immediately and some force is necessary to act against it. This force can take one of three forms: gravitation in stars, magnetic forces in magnetic confinement fusion reactors, or [[inertia]]l as the fusion reaction may occur before the plasma starts to expand, so the plasma's inertia is keeping the material together.\n\n=== Gravitational confinement ===\n{{main|Stellar nucleosynthesis}}{{unreferenced section|date=August 2023}}\nOne force capable of confining the fuel well enough to satisfy the [[Lawson criterion]] is [[gravity]]. The mass needed, however, is so great that gravitational confinement is only found in [[star]]s\u2014the least massive stars capable of sustained fusion are [[red dwarf]]s, while [[brown dwarf]]s are able to fuse [[deuterium]] and [[lithium]] if they are of sufficient mass. In stars [[Asymptotic giant branch|heavy enough]], after the supply of hydrogen is exhausted in their cores, their cores (or a shell around the core) start fusing [[triple-alpha process|helium to carbon]]. In the most massive stars (at least 8\u201311 [[solar mass]]es), the process is continued until some of their energy is produced by [[Silicon burning process|fusing lighter elements to iron]]. As iron has one of the highest [[binding energy#Nuclear binding energy curve|binding energies]], reactions producing heavier elements are generally [[endothermic]]. Therefore, significant amounts of heavier elements are not formed during stable periods of massive star evolution, but are formed in [[R-process|supernova explosions]]. [[s-process|Some lighter stars]] also form these elements in the outer parts of the stars over long periods of time, by absorbing energy from fusion in the inside of the star, by absorbing neutrons that are emitted from the fusion process.\n\nAll of the elements heavier than iron have some potential energy to release, in theory. At the extremely heavy end of element production, these heavier elements can [[exothermic|produce energy]] in the process of being split again back toward the size of iron, in the process of [[nuclear fission]]. Nuclear fission thus releases energy that has been stored, sometimes billions of years before, during stellar [[nucleosynthesis]].\n\n=== Magnetic confinement ===\n{{main|Magnetic confinement fusion}}\nElectrically charged particles (such as fuel ions) will follow [[magnetic field]] lines (see [[Guiding center#Gyration|Guiding centre]]). The fusion fuel can therefore be trapped using a strong magnetic field. A variety of magnetic configurations exist, including the toroidal geometries of [[tokamak]]s and [[stellarator]]s and open-ended mirror confinement systems.\n\n=== Inertial confinement ===\n{{main|Inertial confinement fusion}}\nA third confinement principle is to apply a rapid pulse of energy to a large part of the surface of a pellet of fusion fuel, causing it to simultaneously \"implode\" and heat to very high pressure and temperature. If the fuel is dense enough and hot enough, the fusion reaction rate will be high enough to burn a significant fraction of the fuel before it has dissipated. To achieve these extreme conditions, the initially cold fuel must be explosively compressed. Inertial confinement is used in the [[hydrogen bomb]], where the driver is [[x-rays]] created by a fission bomb. Inertial confinement is also attempted in \"controlled\" nuclear fusion, where the driver is a [[laser]], [[ion]], or [[electron]] beam, or a [[Z-pinch]]. Another method is to use conventional high [[explosive material]] to compress a fuel to fusion conditions.<ref>F.

Positive ions fly towards the negative inner cage, and are heated by the electric field in the process. If they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse. Ions typically hit the cathode, however, creating prohibitory high [[conduction (heat)|conduction]] losses. Also, fusion rates in [[fusor]]s are very low due to competing physical effects, such as energy loss in the form of light radiation.<ref>Ion Flow and Fusion Reactivity, Characterization of a Spherically convergent ion Focus. PhD Thesis, Dr. Timothy A Thorson, Wisconsin-Madison 1996.</ref> Designs have been proposed to avoid the problems associated with the cage, by generating the field using a non-neutral cloud. These include a plasma oscillating device,<ref>\"Stable, thermal equilibrium, large-amplitude, spherical plasma oscillations in electrostatic confinement devices\", DC Barnes and Rick Nebel, PHYSICS OF PLASMAS VOLUME 5, NUMBER 7 JULY 1998</ref> a [[Penning trap]] and the [[polywell]].<ref>Carr, M.; Khachan, J.

For example, at solar core temperature (''T'' \u2248 15&nbsp;MK) and density (160&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), the energy release rate is only 276&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>3</sup>\u2014about a quarter of the volumetric rate at which a resting human body generates heat.<ref>[http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/CPEP/Chart_Pages/5.Plasmas/SunLayers.html FusEdWeb | Fusion Education]. Fusedweb.pppl.gov (9 November 1998). Retrieved 17 August 2011. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024012758/http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/CPEP/Chart_pages/5.Plasmas/SunLayers.html |date=24 October 2007 }}</ref> Thus, reproduction of stellar core conditions in a lab for nuclear fusion power production is completely impractical. Because nuclear reaction rates depend on density as well as temperature, and most fusion schemes operate at relatively low densities, those methods are strongly dependent on higher temperatures. The fusion rate as a function of temperature (exp(\u2212''E''/''kT'')), leads to the need to achieve temperatures in terrestrial reactors 10\u2013100 times higher than in stellar interiors: ''T'' \u2248 {{val|0.1|\u2013|1.0|e=9|u=K}}.\n\n===Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions===\n{{main article|Fusion power#Fuels}}\nIn artificial fusion, the primary fuel is not constrained to be protons and higher temperatures can be used, so reactions with larger cross-sections are chosen. Another concern is the production of neutrons, which activate the reactor structure radiologically, but also have the advantages of allowing volumetric extraction of the fusion energy and [[tritium]] breeding. Reactions that release no neutrons are referred to as [[Aneutronic fusion|''aneutronic'']].\n\nTo be a useful energy source, a fusion reaction must satisfy several criteria. It must:\n\n;Be [[exothermic]]: This limits the reactants to the low ''Z'' (number of protons) side of the [[Nuclear binding energy#Nuclear binding energy curve|curve of binding energy]]. It also makes helium {{SimpleNuclide|link=yes|Helium|4}} the most common product because of its extraordinarily tight binding, although {{SimpleNuclide|link=yes|Helium|3}} and {{SimpleNuclide|link=yes|Hydrogen|3}} also show up.\n;Involve low atomic number (''Z'') nuclei: This is because the electrostatic repulsion that must be overcome before the nuclei are close enough to fuse ( [[Coulomb barrier]] ) is directly related to the number of protons it contains \u2013 its atomic number.\n;Have two reactants: At anything less than stellar densities, three-body collisions are too improbable. In inertial confinement, both stellar densities and temperatures are exceeded to compensate for the shortcomings of the third parameter of the Lawson criterion, ICF's very short confinement time.\n;Have two or more products: This allows simultaneous conservation of energy and momentum without relying on the electromagnetic force.\n;Conserve both protons and neutrons: The cross sections for the weak interaction are too small.\n\nFew reactions meet these criteria. The following are those with the largest cross sections:<ref>{{cite book\n |author1         = M. Kikuchi, K. Lackner\n |author2         = M. Q.

reactions with two products, the energy is divided between them in inverse proportion to their masses, as shown. In most reactions with three products, the distribution of energy varies. For reactions that can result in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.\n\nSome reaction candidates can be eliminated at once. The D\u2013<sup>6</sup>Li reaction has no advantage compared to [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|Boron|11}} because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially more neutrons through {{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}} side reactions.

Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that {{math|{{angbr|''\u03c3v''}}/''T''<sup>2</sup>}} is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product {{mvar|nT\u03c4}} required for [[Fusion energy gain factor#Ignition|ignition]] is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to {{math|{{angbr|''\u03c3v''}}/''T''<sup>2</sup>}} (see [[Lawson criterion]]). (A plasma is \"ignited\" if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of {{math|{{angbr|''\u03c3v''}}/''T''<sup>2</sup>}} at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                           !!

For instance, a reactor fueled with {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} creates some {{nuclide|deuterium}}, which is then possible to use in the {{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction if the energies are \"right\". An elegant idea is to combine the reactions (8) and (9). The {{nuclide|helium|3}} from reaction (8) can react with {{nuclide|lithium|6}} in reaction (9) before completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton, which in turn undergoes reaction (8) before thermalizing. Detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work well,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but it is a good example of a case where the usual assumption of a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] plasma is not appropriate.\n\n=== Abundance of the nuclear fusion fuels ===\n{{See also|Abundance of the chemical elements|Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|Abundances of the elements (data page)|Aneutronic fusion|CNO cycle|Cold fusion}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Nuclear Fusion Fuel Isotope\n!Half-Life\n!Abundance\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|hydrogen|1|link=yes}}<ref>[[CNO cycle#]]</ref><ref name=\":5\">[[CNO cycle#CNO-I]]</ref><ref name=\":6\">[[CNO cycle#CNO-II]]</ref><ref name=\":7\">[[CNO cycle#CNO-III]]</ref><ref name=\":8\">[[CNO cycle#CNO-IV]]</ref><ref name=\":9\">[[CNO cycle#HCNO-I]]</ref><ref name=\":10\">[[CNO cycle#HCNO-II]]</ref><ref name=\":11\">[[CNO cycle#HCNO-III]]</ref>{{Excessive citations inline|date=December 2024}}\n|Stable\n|99.98%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|deuterium|link=yes}}<ref name=\":2\">[[Nuclear fusion#Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions]]</ref><ref name=\":3\">[[Aneutronic fusion#Coulomb barrier]]</ref><ref name=\":4\">[[Aneutronic fusion#Candidate reactions]]</ref><ref name=\":1\">[[Cold fusion#Lack of expected reaction products]]</ref>\n|Stable\n|0.02%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|tritium|link=yes}}<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n|12.32(2) y\n|trace\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|Helium|3|link=yes}}<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n|stable\n|0.0002%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|Helium|4|link=yes}}<ref name=\":1\" />\n|stable\n|99.9998%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|lithium|6|link=yes}}<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n|stable\n|7.59%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|lithium|7|link=yes}}<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n|stable\n|92.41%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|boron|11|link=yes}}<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>[[Aneutronic fusion#Residual radiation]]</ref>\n|stable\n|80%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|carbon|12|link=yes}}<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n|stable\n|98.9%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|carbon|13|link=yes}}<ref name=\":5\" />\n|stable\n|1.1%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|nitrogen|13|link=yes}}<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n|9.965(4) min\n|syn\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|nitrogen|14|link=yes}}<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n|stable\n|99.6%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|nitrogen|15|link=yes}}<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":4\" />{{Excessive citations inline|date=December 2024}}\n|stable\n|0.4%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|oxygen|14|link=yes}}<ref name=\":9\" />\n|70.621(11) s\n|syn\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|oxygen|15|link=yes}}<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n|122.266(43) s\n|syn\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|oxygen|16|link=yes}}<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" />{{Excessive citations inline|date=December 2024}}\n|stable\n|99.76%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|oxygen|17|link=yes}}<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" />\n|stable\n|0.04%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|oxygen|18|link=yes}}<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" />\n|stable\n|0.20%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|fluorine|17|link=yes}}<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" />\n|64.370(27) s\n|syn\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|fluorine|18|link=yes}}<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" />\n|109.734(8) min\n|trace\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|fluorine|19|link=yes}}<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":11\" />\n|stable\n|100%\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|Neon|18|link=yes}}<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" />\n|1664.20(47) ms\n|trace\n|-\n|{{Nuclide|Neon|19|link=yes}}<ref name=\":11\" />\n|17.2569(19) s\n|trace\n|}\n\n=== Neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density ===\nAny of the reactions above can in principle be the basis of [[fusion power]] production. In addition to the temperature and cross section discussed above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion products ''E''<sub>fus</sub>, the energy of the charged fusion products ''E''<sub>ch</sub>, and the atomic number ''Z'' of the non-hydrogenic reactant.\n\nSpecification of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must average over the two branches (2i) and (2ii). More difficult is to decide how to treat the {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} products. {{nuclide|tritium}} burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to extract from the plasma. The {{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at the optimum {{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|deuterium}} temperature may be low. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume the {{nuclide|tritium}} but not the {{nuclide|helium|3}} gets burned up and adds its energy to the net reaction, which means the total reaction would be the sum of (2i), (2ii), and (1):\n\n:5 {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} \u2192 {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 2 [[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]] + {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}} + [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]],  ''E''<sub>fus</sub> = 4.03 + 17.6 + 3.27 = 24.9&nbsp;MeV, ''E''<sub>ch</sub> = 4.03 + 3.5 + 0.82 = 8.35&nbsp;MeV.\n\nFor calculating the power of a reactor (in which the reaction rate is determined by the D\u2013D step), we count the {{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|deuterium}} fusion energy ''per D\u2013D reaction'' as ''E''<sub>fus</sub> = (4.03&nbsp;MeV + 17.6&nbsp;MeV) \u00d7 50% + (3.27&nbsp;MeV) \u00d7 50% = 12.5&nbsp;MeV and the energy in charged particles as ''E''<sub>ch</sub> = (4.03&nbsp;MeV + 3.5&nbsp;MeV) \u00d7 50% + (0.82&nbsp;MeV) \u00d7 50% = 4.2&nbsp;MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may be quite different from 3.5 MeV,<ref>A momentum and energy balance shows that if the tritium has an energy of E<sub>T</sub> (and using relative masses of 1, 3, and 4 for the neutron, tritium, and helium) then the energy of the helium can be anything from [(12E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>\u2212(5\u00d717.6MeV+2\u00d7E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>/25 to [(12E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>+(5\u00d717.6MeV+2\u00d7E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>/25. For E<sub>T</sub>=1.01&nbsp;MeV this gives a range from 1.44&nbsp;MeV to 6.73&nbsp;MeV.</ref> so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0&nbsp;MeV (a [[specific energy]] of about 225&nbsp;million [[Megajoule|MJ]] per kilogram of deuterium).\n\nAnother unique aspect of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.\n\nWith this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important reactions\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                          !!''Z''!!''E''<sub>fus</sub> [MeV]!!''E''<sub>ch</sub> [MeV]!!neutronicity\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|tritium}}     ||  1  || 17.6 || 3.5 || 0.80\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|deuterium}}   ||  1  || 12.5 || 4.2 || 0.66\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|helium|3}}    ||  2  || 18.3 ||18.3 || \u22480.05\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>\u2013{{nuclide|boron|11}}            ||  5  || 8.7  || 8.7 || \u22480.001\n|}\n\nThe last column is the [[aneutronic fusion|neutronicity]] of the reaction, the fraction of the fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator of the magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is calculated as {{nowrap|(''E''<sub>fus</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>ch</sub>)/''E''<sub>fus</sub>}}. For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal equilibrium.\n\nOf course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total pressure is fixed, this means that particle density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of the hydrogenic ion by a factor {{nowrap|2/(''Z'' + 1)}}. Therefore, the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the values of {{math|{{angbr|''\u03c3v''}}/''T''<sup>2</sup>}}. On the other hand, because the {{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a more efficient reaction.\n\nThus there is a \"penalty\" of {{nowrap|2/(''Z'' + 1)}} for non-hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require more electrons, which take up pressure without participating in the fusion reaction. (It is usually a good assumption that the electron temperature will be nearly equal to the ion temperature. Some authors, however, discuss the possibility that the electrons could be maintained substantially colder than the ions. In such a case, known as a \"hot ion mode\", the \"penalty\" would not apply.) There is at the same time a \"bonus\" of a factor 2 for {{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|deuterium}} because each ion can react with any of the other ions, not just a fraction of them.\n\nWe can now compare these reactions in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                         !!{{math|{{angbr|''\u03c3v''}}/''T''<sup>2</sup>}}!!penalty/bonus !!inverse reactivity!!Lawson criterion!!power density [W/m<sup>3</sup>/kPa<sup>2</sup>]!!inverse ratio of power density\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|tritium}}    || {{val|1.24|e=-24}} ||  1  ||    1 ||   1 || 34     ||    1\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|deuterium}}  || {{val|1.28|e=-26}} ||  2  ||   48 ||  30 ||  0.5   ||   68\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|helium|3}}   || {{val|2.24|e=-26}} || 2/3 ||   83 ||  16 ||  0.43  ||   80\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>\u2013{{nuclide|lithium|6}}          || {{val|1.46|e=-27}} || 1/2 || 1700 ||     || 0.005  || 6800\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>\u2013{{nuclide|boron|11}}           || {{val|3.01|e=-27}} || 1/3 || 1240 || 500 || 0.014  || 2500\n|}\n\nThe maximum value of {{math|{{angbr|''\u03c3v''}}/''T''<sup>2</sup>}} is taken from a previous table. The \"penalty/bonus\" factor is that related to a non-hydrogenic reactant or a single-species reaction. The values in the column \"inverse reactivity\" are found by dividing {{val|1.24|e=-24}} by the product of the second and third columns. It indicates the factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction under comparable conditions. The column \"[[Lawson criterion]]\" weights these results with ''E''<sub>ch</sub> and gives an indication of how much more difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the difficulty for the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction. The next-to-last column is labeled \"power density\" and weights the practical reactivity by ''E''<sub>fus</sub>. The final column indicates how much lower the fusion power density of the other reactions is compared to the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.\n\n===Bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2023}}\nThe ions undergoing fusion in many systems will essentially never occur alone but will be mixed with [[electron]]s that in aggregate neutralize the ions' bulk [[electrical charge]] and form a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The electrons will generally have a temperature comparable to or greater than that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit [[x-ray]] radiation of 10\u201330 keV energy, a process known as [[Bremsstrahlung]].\n\nThe huge size of the Sun and stars means that the x-rays produced in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They are said to be [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be [[Optical depth|optically thin]] for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a reactor's shield). This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.\n \nThe ratio of fusion power produced to x-ray radiation lost to walls is an important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the previous subsection). The following table shows estimates of the optimum temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several reactions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                        !!''T''<sub>i</sub> [keV]!!''P''<sub>fusion</sub>/''P''<sub>Bremsstrahlung</sub>\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|tritium}}   ||   50 || 140\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|deuterium}} ||  500 ||   2.9\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|helium|3}}  ||  100 ||   5.3\n|-\n|{{nuclide|helium|3}}\u2013{{nuclide|helium|3}}   || 1000 ||   0.72\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>\u2013{{nuclide|lithium|6}}         ||  800 ||   0.21\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>\u2013{{nuclide|boron|11}}          ||  300 ||   0.57\n|}\n\nThe actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be significantly lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves ''must'' remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and ''will'' remain for some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.\n\nThe temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung are in every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value of the [[Lawson criterion|fusion triple product]]. This will not change the optimum operating point for {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative to {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} is even lower and the required confinement even more difficult to achieve. For {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} and {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive problem. For {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|6}} and [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]\u2013{{nuclide|link=yes|boron|11}} the Bremsstrahlung losses appear to make a fusion reactor using these fuels with a quasineutral, isotropic plasma impossible. Some ways out of this dilemma have been considered but rejected.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fundamental Limitations on Plasma Fusion Systems not in Thermodynamic Equilibrium|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International|volume= 56-07 |issue=Section B|page= 3820|author=Rider, Todd Harrison|bibcode=1995PhDT........45R|year=1995}}</ref><ref>Rostoker, Norman; Binderbauer, Michl and Qerushi,\nArtan.

Estimating the radius of an atomic nuclei as about one femtometer, the energy needed for fusion of two hydrogen is:\n\n:<math chem>E_{\\ce{thresh}}= \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z_1 Z_2}{r} \\ce{->[\\text{2 protons}]} \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{1\\ \\ce{fm}} \\approx 1.4\\ \\ce{MeV}</math>\n\nThis would imply that for the core of the sun, which has a [[Boltzmann distribution]] with a temperature of around 1.4 keV, the probability hydrogen would reach the threshold is <math>10^{-290}</math>, that is, fusion would never occur. However, fusion in the sun does occur due to quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Parameterization of cross section ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2023}}\nThe probability that fusion occurs is greatly increased compared to the classical picture, thanks to the smearing of the effective radius as the [[Matter wave|de Broglie wavelength]] as well as [[quantum tunneling]] through the potential barrier. To determine the rate of fusion reactions, the value of most interest is the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]], which describes the probability that particles will fuse by giving a characteristic area of interaction. An estimation of the fusion cross-sectional area is often broken into three pieces:\n:<math>\\sigma \\approx \\sigma_\\text{geometry} \\times T \\times R, </math>\nwhere <math>\\sigma_\\text{geometry} </math> is the geometric cross section, {{mvar|T}} is the barrier transparency and {{mvar|R}} is the reaction characteristics of the reaction.\n\n<math>\\sigma_\\text{geometry} </math> is of the order of the square of the de Broglie wavelength <math>\\sigma_\\text{geometry} \\approx \\lambda^2 = \\bigg( \\frac{\\hbar}{m_r v} \\bigg)^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} </math> where <math>m_r </math> is the reduced mass of the system and <math>\\epsilon  </math> is the center of mass energy of the system.\n\n{{mvar|T}} can be approximated by the Gamow transparency, which has the form: <math>T \\approx e^ {- \\sqrt{\\epsilon_G /\\epsilon} } </math> where <math>\\epsilon_G = ( \\pi \\alpha Z_1 Z_2)^2 \\times 2 m_r c^2 </math> is the [[Gamow factor]] and comes from estimating the quantum tunneling probability through the potential barrier.\n\n{{mvar|R}} contains all the nuclear physics of the specific reaction and takes very different values depending on the nature of the interaction. However, for most reactions, the variation of <math>R(\\epsilon)</math> is small compared to the variation from the Gamow factor and so is approximated by a function called the astrophysical [[S-factor]], <math>S(\\epsilon)</math>, which is weakly varying in energy.
