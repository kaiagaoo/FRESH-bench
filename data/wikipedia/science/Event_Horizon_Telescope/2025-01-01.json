NRAO 530 (1730\u2212130, J1733\u22121304) is a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) that belongs to the class of bright \u03b3-ray [[blazar]]s and shows significant variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The source was monitored by the University of Michigan Radio Observatory at 4.8, 8.4, and 14.5&nbsp;GHz for several decades until 2012. The quasar underwent a dramatic radio outburst in 1997, during which its flux density at 14.5&nbsp;GHz exceeded 10 Jy, while the average value is ~2 Jy. Since 2002, NRAO 530 has been monitored by the Submillimeter Array (SMA; Maunakea, Hawaii) at 1.3 mm and 870 \u03bcm. NRAO 530 has a redshift of z = 0.902 (Junkkarinen 1984), for which 100 \u03bcas corresponds to a linear distance of 0.803 pc. The source contains a supermassive black hole, the mass of which is currently uncertain, with estimates ranging from {{val|3e8}} M\u2609 to {{val|2e9}} M\u2609.<ref name=\"nrao530\">{{cite journal |last1=Jorstad |first1=Svetlana |last2=Wielgus |first2=Maciek |last3=Lico |first3=Rocco |display-authors=1 |title=The Event Horizon Telescope Image of the Quasar NRAO 530 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=1 February 2023 |volume=943 |issue=2 |pages=170 |doi=10.3847/1538-4357/acaea8 |arxiv=2302.04622 |bibcode=2023ApJ...943..170J |s2cid=256661718 |doi-access=free }} [[File:CC BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0]</ref>\n\nIt was observed with the Event Horizon Telescope on 2017 April 5\u22127, when NRAO 530 was used as a calibrator for the EHT observations of Sagittarius A*. The observations were performed with the full EHT 2017 array of eight telescopes located at six geographical sites. At z = 0.902, this is the most distant object imaged by the EHT so far. The team reconstructed the first images of the source at 230&nbsp;GHz, at an angular resolution of ~20 \u03bcas, both in total intensity and in linear polarization (LP). Source variability was not detected, that allowed to represent the whole data set with static images. The images reveal a bright feature located on the southern end of the jet, which was associated with the core. The feature is linearly polarized, with a fractional polarization of ~5%\u20138%, and it has a substructure consisting of two components. Their observed brightness temperature suggests that the energy density of the jet is dominated by the magnetic field. The jet extends over 60 \u03bcas along a position angle ~ \u221228\u00b0. It includes two features with orthogonal directions of polarization (electric vector position angle), parallel and perpendicular to the jet axis, consistent with a helical structure of the magnetic field in the jet. The outermost feature has a particularly high degree of LP, suggestive of a nearly uniform magnetic field.<ref name=\"nrao530\"/>\n\n== Collaborating institutes ==\nThe EHT Collaboration consists of 13 stakeholder institutes:<ref>[http://eventhorizontelescope.org/organization Event Horizon Telescopoe, Organisation], EHT Website, accessed: 2022-01-30.</ref>\n* the [[Academia Sinica]] Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics\n* the [[University of Arizona]]\n* the [[University of Chicago]]\n* the [[East Asian Observatory]]\n* [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]\n* [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (part of the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|Center for Astrophysics {{!}} Harvard & Smithsonian]])\n* [[Institut de radioastronomie millim\u00e9trique]] (IRAM, itself a collaboration between the French [[CNRS]], the German [[Max Planck Society]], and the Spanish [[Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Nacional (Spain)|Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Nacional]]),\n* [[Large Millimeter Telescope]] Alfonso Serrano\n* [[Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy]]\n* [[MIT]] [[Haystack Observatory]]\n* [[National Astronomical Observatory of Japan]]\n* [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]]\n* [[Radboud University]]\n\n[[File:Locations of the telescopes that make up the EHT array (eso2208-eht-mwi).tiff|thumb|center|upright=4|Locations of the telescopes that make up the EHT array.
