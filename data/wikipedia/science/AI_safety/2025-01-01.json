It encompasses [[machine ethics]] and [[AI alignment]], which aim to ensure AI systems are moral and beneficial, as well as monitoring AI systems for risks and enhancing their reliability. The field is particularly concerned with [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|existential risks]] posed by advanced AI models.\n\nBeyond technical research, AI safety involves developing norms and policies that promote safety. It gained significant popularity in 2023, with rapid progress in [[generative AI]] and public concerns voiced by researchers and CEOs about potential dangers. During the 2023 [[AI Safety Summit]], the United States and the United Kingdom both established their own [[AI Safety Institute]]. However, researchers have expressed concern that AI safety measures are not keeping pace with the rapid development of AI capabilities.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Perrigo |first=Billy |date=2023-11-02 |title=U.K.'s AI Safety Summit Ends With Limited, but Meaningful, Progress |url=https://time.com/6330877/uk-ai-safety-summit/ |access-date=2024-06-02 |magazine=Time |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Motivations ==\nScholars discuss current risks from [[Critical system|critical systems]] failures,<ref>{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last = De-Arteaga| first = Maria| title = Machine Learning in High-Stakes Settings: Risks and Opportunities| date = 2020-05-13 |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University}}</ref> [[Algorithmic bias|bias]],<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal |last1=Mehrabi |first1=Ninareh |last2=Morstatter |first2=Fred |last3=Saxena |first3=Nripsuta |last4=Lerman |first4=Kristina |last5=Galstyan |first5=Aram |date=2021 |title=A Survey on Bias and Fairness in Machine Learning |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457607 |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |language=en |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=1\u201335 |doi=10.1145/3457607 |arxiv=1908.09635 |s2cid=201666566 |issn=0360-0300 |access-date=2022-11-28 |archive-date=2022-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221123054208/https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457607 |url-status=live }}</ref> and AI-enabled surveillance,<ref>{{Cite report| publisher = Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|last = Feldstein| first = Steven|authorlink=Steven Feldstein| title = The Global Expansion of AI Surveillance| date = 2019}}</ref> as well as emerging risks like [[technological unemployment]], digital manipulation,<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Barnes| first = Beth| title = Risks from AI persuasion| journal = Lesswrong| accessdate = 2022-11-23| date = 2021| url = https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5cWtwATHL6KyzChck/risks-from-ai-persuasion| archive-date = 2022-11-23| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20221123055429/https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5cWtwATHL6KyzChck/risks-from-ai-persuasion| url-status = live}}</ref> weaponization,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal |last1=Brundage |first1=Miles |last2=Avin |first2=Shahar |last3=Clark |first3=Jack |last4=Toner |first4=Helen |last5=Eckersley |first5=Peter |last6=Garfinkel |first6=Ben |last7=Dafoe |first7=Allan |last8=Scharre |first8=Paul |last9=Zeitzoff |first9=Thomas |last10=Filar |first10=Bobby |last11=Anderson |first11=Hyrum |last12=Roff |first12=Heather |last13=Allen |first13=Gregory C |last14=Steinhardt |first14=Jacob |last15=Flynn |first15=Carrick |date=2018-04-30 |others=Apollo-University Of Cambridge Repository, Apollo-University Of Cambridge Repository |title=The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation |publisher=Apollo - University of Cambridge Repository |url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/275332 |doi=10.17863/cam.22520 |s2cid=3385567 |access-date=2022-11-28 |archive-date=2022-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221123055429/https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/275332 |url-status=live }}</ref> AI-enabled [[Cyberattack|cyberattacks]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davies |first=Pascale |date=December 26, 2022 |title=How NATO is preparing for a new era of AI cyber attacks |url=https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/12/26/ai-cyber-attacks-are-a-critical-threat-this-is-how-nato-is-countering-them |access-date=2024-03-23 |website=euronews |language=en}}</ref> and [[bioterrorism]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ahuja |first=Anjana |date=February 7, 2024 |title=AI's bioterrorism potential should not be ruled out |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e2a28b73-9831-4e7e-be7c-a599d2498f24 |access-date=2024-03-23 |website=Financial Times}}</ref> They also discuss speculative risks from losing control of future [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) agents,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Carlsmith |first=Joseph |date=2022-06-16 |title=Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk? |arxiv=2206.13353}}</ref> or from AI enabling perpetually stable dictatorships.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Minardi |first=Di |date=16 October 2020 |title=The grim fate that could be 'worse than extinction' |url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201014-totalitarian-world-in-chains-artificial-intelligence |access-date=2024-03-23 |website=BBC}}</ref>\n\n=== Existential safety ===\n{{See also|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}\nSome have criticized concerns about AGI, such as [[Andrew Ng]] who compared them in 2015 to \"worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet yet\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-04-04 |title=AGI Expert Peter Voss Says AI Alignment Problem is Bogus {{!}} NextBigFuture.com |url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/04/agi-expert-peter-voss-says-ai-alignment-problem-is-bogus.html |access-date=2023-07-23 |language=en-US}}</ref> [[Stuart J.

FAccT '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, 610-623. https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922.</ref> have highlighted the environmental and financial costs associated with training these models, emphasizing that the energy consumption and carbon footprint of training procedures like those for Transformer models can be substantial. Moreover, these models often rely on massive, uncurated Internet-based datasets, which can encode hegemonic and biased viewpoints, further marginalizing underrepresented groups. The large-scale training data, while vast, does not guarantee diversity and often reflects the worldviews of privileged demographics, leading to models that perpetuate existing biases and stereotypes. This situation is exacerbated by the tendency of these models to produce seemingly coherent and fluent text, which can mislead users into attributing meaning and intent where none exists, a phenomenon described as 'stochastic parrots'. These models, therefore, pose risks of amplifying societal biases, spreading misinformation, and being used for malicious purposes, such as generating extremist propaganda or deepfakes. To address these challenges, researchers advocate for more careful planning in dataset creation and system development, emphasizing the need for research projects that contribute positively towards an equitable technological ecosystem.<ref>Strubell, E., Ganesh, A., & McCallum, A.

[[Deontology|Deontological]] ethics, which emphasizes adherence to moral rules, has been proposed as a framework for aligning AI systems with human values. By embedding deontological principles, AI systems can be guided to avoid actions that cause harm, ensuring their operations remain within ethical boundaries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=D\u2019Alessandro |first1=W. |date=2024 |title=Deontology and safe artificial intelligence |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-024-02174-y |access-date=2024-12-06 |journal=Philosophical Studies|doi=10.1007/s11098-024-02174-y |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n=== Scaling local measures to global solutions ===\nIn addressing the AI safety problem it is important to stress the distinction between local and global solutions. Local solutions focus on individual AI systems, ensuring they are safe and beneficial, while global solutions seek to implement safety measures for all AI systems across various jurisdictions. Some researchers<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Turchin |first1=Alexey |last2=Dench |first2=David |last3=Green |first3=Brian Patrick |title=Global Solutions vs. Local Solutions for the AI Safety Problem |journal=Big Data and Cognitive Computing |volume=3 |issue=16 |pages=1\u201325 |year=2019 |doi=10.3390/bdcc3010016 |doi-access=free }}</ref> argue for the necessity of scaling local safety measures to a global level, proposing a classification for these global solutions. This approach underscores the importance of collaborative efforts in the international governance of AI safety, emphasizing that no single entity can effectively manage the risks associated with AI technologies.
