In a fusion process, two lighter [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] combine to form a heavier nucleus, while releasing energy. Devices designed to harness this energy are known as fusion reactors. Research into fusion reactors began in the 1940s, but as of 2022, only one design, an [[Inertial confinement fusion|inertial confinement]] laser-driven fusion machine at the US [[National Ignition Facility]], has conclusively produced a positive [[fusion energy gain factor]], i.e. more power output than input.<ref name=\"NYT-209221213\" /><ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news |date=2022-12-13|title=DOE National Laboratory Makes History by Achieving Fusion Ignition|work=US Department of Energy|url=https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-national-laboratory-makes-history-achieving-fusion-ignition|access-date=2022-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=CNN |first=By Adrienne Vogt, Mike Hayes, Ella Nilsen and Elise Hammond |date=2022-12-13 |title=December 13, 2022 US officials announce nuclear fusion breakthrough |url=https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nuclear-fusion-reaction-us-announcement-12-13-22/index.html |access-date=2022-12-14 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFusion processes require fuel and a confined environment with sufficient [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and confinement time to create a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] in which fusion can occur. The combination of these figures that results in a power-producing system is known as the [[Lawson criterion]]. In stars, the most common fuel is [[hydrogen]], and [[gravity]] provides extremely long confinement times that reach the conditions needed for fusion energy production. Proposed fusion reactors generally use heavy hydrogen [[isotope]]s such as [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] (and especially a [[D+T|mixture of the two]]), which react more easily than [[Protium (isotope)|protium]] (the most common hydrogen isotope), to allow them to reach the Lawson criterion requirements with less extreme conditions. Most designs aim to heat their fuel to around 100 million degrees, which presents a major challenge in producing a successful design.\n\nAs a source of power, nuclear fusion is expected to have many advantages over [[nuclear fission|fission]]. These include reduced [[radioactivity]] in operation and little high-level [[nuclear waste]], ample fuel supplies, and increased safety. However, the necessary combination of temperature, pressure, and duration has proven to be difficult to produce in a practical and economical manner. A second issue that affects common reactions is managing [[neutron]]s that are released during the reaction, which over time [[plasma-facing material|degrade]] many common materials used within the reaction chamber.\n\nFusion researchers have investigated various confinement concepts. The early emphasis was on three main systems: [[z-pinch]], [[stellarator]], and [[magnetic mirror]]. The current leading designs are the [[tokamak]] and [[inertial confinement fusion|inertial confinement]] (ICF) by [[laser]]. Both designs are under research at very large scales, most notably the [[ITER]] tokamak in France, and the [[National Ignition Facility]] (NIF) laser in the United States. Researchers are also studying other designs that may offer cheaper approaches. Among these alternatives, there is increasing interest in [[magnetized target fusion]] and [[inertial electrostatic confinement]], and new variations of the stellarator.\n\n{{Toclimit|5}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Nuclear fusion}}\n[[File:Sun in X-Ray.png|thumb|upright=1|The [[Sun]], like other [[star]]s, is a natural fusion reactor, where [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] transforms lighter elements into heavier elements with the release of energy.]]\n[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Binding energy]] for different [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. Iron-56 has the highest, making it the most stable. Nuclei to the left are likely to release energy when they fuse ([[nuclear fusion|fusion]]); those to the far right are likely to be unstable and release energy when they split ([[nuclear fission|fission]]).]]\n\n=== Mechanism ===\nFusion reactions occur when two or more atomic nuclei come close enough for long enough that the [[nuclear force]] pulling them together exceeds the [[electrostatic force]] pushing them apart, fusing them into heavier nuclei. For nuclei heavier than iron-56, the reaction is [[endothermic]], requiring an input of energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html#c2|title=Fission and fusion can yield energy|publisher=Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|access-date=30 October 2014}}</ref> The heavy nuclei bigger than iron have many more protons resulting in a greater repulsive force. For nuclei lighter than [[iron-56]], the reaction is [[exothermic]], releasing energy when they fuse. Since hydrogen has a single proton in its nucleus, it requires the least effort to attain fusion, and yields the most net energy output. Also since it has one electron, hydrogen is the easiest fuel to fully ionize.\n\nThe strong force acts only over short distances (one femtometre at most, the diameter of one proton or neutron), while the repulsive electrostatic force between nuclei acts over longer distances. In order to undergo fusion, the fuel atoms need to be given enough kinetic energy to approach each other closely enough for the strong force to overcome the electrostatic repulsion. The amount of [[kinetic energy]] needed to bring the fuel atoms close enough is known as the \"[[Coulomb barrier]]\". Ways of providing this energy include speeding up atoms in a [[particle accelerator]], or heating them to high temperatures.\n\nOnce an atom is heated above its [[ionization energy]], its [[electron]]s are stripped away.  The resulting bare nucleus is known as an [[ion]].   This [[ionization]] makes a hot cloud of ions and free electrons formerly attached to them, known as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].  Because the charges are separated, plasmas are [[electrically conductive]] and magnetically controllable.  Many fusion devices take advantage of this to confine the particles as they are heated.\n\n=== Cross section ===\n[[File:Fusion rxnrate.svg|right|upright=1.5|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The deuterium-tritium fusion rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]\n\nA reaction's [[cross section (physics)|cross section]], denoted \u03c3, measures the probability that a fusion reaction will happen. This depends on the relative velocity of the two nuclei. Higher relative velocities generally increase the probability, but the probability begins to decrease again at very high energies.<ref name=\"osti.gov\">{{cite report|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc872035/|title=Fusion cross sections and reactivities|last1=Miley|first1=G.H.|last2=Towner|first2=H.|date=1974-06-17|doi=10.2172/4014032|osti=4014032|last3=Ivich|first3=N.|type=Technical Report|via=Osti.gov}}</ref>\n\nIn a plasma, particle velocity can be characterized using a [[probability distribution]]. If the plasma is [[Thermalisation|thermalized]], the distribution looks like a [[Gaussian curve]], or [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. In this case, it is useful to use the average particle cross section over the velocity distribution. This is entered into the volumetric fusion rate:<ref name=\"Lawson\">{{cite journal | last=Lawson | first=J D | title=Some Criteria for a Power Producing Thermonuclear Reactor | journal=Proceedings of the Physical Society.

Radiation is energy that leaves the cloud as light. Radiation increases with temperature. Fusion power technologies must overcome these losses.\n\n=== Triple product: density, temperature, time ===\n[[File:Fusion Triples 2021.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Fusion trapping (left) against temperature (bottom) for various fusion approaches as of 2021, assuming DT fuel. |Fusion trapping (left) against temperature (bottom) for various fusion approaches as of 2021, assuming DT fuel<ref>Wurzel, Samuel E., and Scott C.

Need to explain their meaning|date=June 2022}}]]\nThe [[Lawson criterion]] argues that a machine holding a thermalized and quasi-[[Neutral particle|neutral]] plasma has to generate enough energy to overcome its energy losses. The amount of energy released in a given volume is a function of the temperature, and thus the reaction rate on a per-particle basis, the density of particles within that volume, and finally the confinement time, the length of time that energy stays within the volume.<ref name=\"Lawson\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efda.org/2013/02/triple-product/ |title=Lawson's three criteria |publisher=EFDA |date=February 25, 2013 |access-date=2014-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911210243/http://www.efda.org/2013/02/triple-product/ |archive-date=2014-09-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This is known as the \"triple product\": the plasma density, temperature, and confinement time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efda.org/glossary/triple-product/ |title=Triple product |publisher=EFDA |date=2014-06-20 |access-date=2014-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911205015/http://www.efda.org/glossary/triple-product/ |archive-date=2014-09-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn magnetic confinement, the density is low, on the order of a \"good vacuum\". For instance, in the [[ITER]] device the fuel density is about 1.0&#8239;'''\u00b7'''&#8239;10<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>\u22123</sup>, which is about one-millionth atmospheric density.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/e06/TALKS/FRYCPA01_TALK.PDF |title=ITER and the International ITER and the International Scientific Collaboration |first=Stefano |last=Chiocchio}}</ref> This means that the temperature and/or confinement time must increase. Fusion-relevant temperatures have been achieved using a variety of heating methods that were developed in the early 1970s. In modern machines, {{asof|2019|lc=yes}}, the major remaining issue was the confinement time. Plasmas in strong magnetic fields are subject to a number of inherent instabilities, which must be suppressed to reach useful durations. One way to do this is to simply make the reactor volume larger, which reduces the rate of leakage due to [[classical diffusion]]. This is why ITER is so large.\n\nIn contrast, inertial confinement systems approach useful triple product values via higher density, and have short confinement intervals. In [[National Ignition Facility|NIF]], the initial frozen hydrogen fuel load has a density less than water that is increased to about 100 times the density of lead. In these conditions, the rate of fusion is so high that the fuel fuses in the microseconds it takes for the heat generated by the reactions to blow the fuel apart. Although NIF is also large, this is a function of its \"driver\" design, not inherent to the fusion process.\n\n=== Energy capture ===\nMultiple approaches have been proposed to capture the energy that fusion produces. The simplest is to heat a fluid. The commonly targeted D-T reaction releases much of its energy as fast-moving neutrons. Electrically neutral, the neutron is unaffected by the confinement scheme. In most designs, it is captured in a thick \"blanket\" of [[lithium]] surrounding the reactor core. When struck by a high-energy neutron, the blanket heats up. It is then actively cooled with a working fluid that drives a turbine to produce power.\n\nAnother design proposed to use the neutrons to breed fission fuel in a blanket of [[nuclear waste]], a concept known as a [[fission-fusion hybrid]]. In these systems, the power output is enhanced by the fission events, and power is extracted using systems like those in conventional fission reactors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://life.llnl.gov/ |title=Laser Inertial Fusion Energy |publisher=Life.llnl.gov |access-date=2014-08-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915170021/https://life.llnl.gov/ |archive-date=2014-09-15 }}</ref>\n\nDesigns that use other fuels, notably the proton-boron [[aneutronic fusion]] reaction, release much more of their energy in the form of charged particles. In these cases, power extraction systems based on the movement of these charges are possible. [[Direct energy conversion]] was developed at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) in the 1980s as a method to maintain a voltage directly using fusion reaction products. This has demonstrated energy capture efficiency of 48 percent.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1=Barr | first1=W. L. | last2=Moir | first2=R. W. | last3=Hamilton | first3=G.

A shell surrounding the fuel is imploded using a direct laser blast (direct drive), a secondary x-ray blast (indirect drive), or heavy beams.

[[Deuterium]] is a naturally occurring [[isotope]] of hydrogen and is commonly available. The large mass ratio of the hydrogen isotopes makes their separation easy compared to the [[uranium enrichment]] process. [[Tritium]] is a natural isotope of hydrogen, but because it has a short [[half-life]] of 12.32 years, it is hard to find, store, produce, and is expensive. Consequently, the deuterium-tritium fuel cycle requires the [[breeder reactor|breeding]] of tritium from [[lithium]] using one of the following reactions:\n\n:{{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} \u2192 {{nuclide|Tritium}} + {{nuclide|Helium}}\n:{{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{nuclide|Lithium|7}} \u2192 {{nuclide|Tritium}} + {{nuclide|Helium}} + {{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}}\n\nThe reactant neutron is supplied by the D-T fusion reaction shown above, and the one that has the greatest energy yield. The reaction with <sup>6</sup>Li is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], providing a small energy gain for the reactor. The reaction with <sup>7</sup>Li is [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]], but does not consume the neutron. Neutron multiplication reactions are required to replace the neutrons lost to absorption by other elements. Leading candidate neutron multiplication materials are [[beryllium]] and [[lead]], but the <sup>7</sup>Li reaction helps to keep the neutron population high. Natural lithium is mainly <sup>7</sup>Li, which has a low tritium production [[Neutron cross section|cross section]] compared to <sup>6</sup>Li so most reactor designs use breeder blankets with enriched <sup>6</sup>Li.\n\nDrawbacks commonly attributed to D-T fusion power include:\n* The supply of neutrons results in [[neutron activation]] of the reactor materials.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Velarde|first1=Guillermo|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/nuclear-fusion-by-inertial-confinement-a-comprehensive-treatise/oclc/468393053|title=Nuclear fusion by inertial confinement: a comprehensive treatise|last2=Mart\u00ednez-Val|first2=Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda|last3=Ronen|first3=Yigal|date=1993|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0849369261|location=Boca Raton; Ann Arbor; London|language=en|oclc=468393053}}</ref><sup>:242</sup>\n* 80% of the resultant energy is  carried off by neutrons, which limits the use of direct energy conversion.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Iiyoshi|first=A|author2=H.

The energy of the neutrons ends up in the lithium, which would then be transferred to drive electrical production. The lithium blanket protects the outer portions of the reactor from the neutron flux. Newer designs, the advanced tokamak in particular, use lithium inside the reactor core as a design element. The plasma interacts directly with the lithium, preventing a problem known as \"recycling\". The advantage of this design was demonstrated in the [[Lithium Tokamak Experiment]].\n\n=== Deuterium ===\n[[File:Deuterium Deuterium Fusion Cross Section.png|thumbnail|upright=1.25|Deuterium fusion cross section (in square meters) at different ion collision energies]]\nFusing two deuterium nuclei is the second easiest fusion reaction.

The optimum energy to initiate this reaction is 15&nbsp;keV, only slightly higher than that for the D-T reaction. The first branch produces tritium, so that a D-D reactor is not tritium-free, even though it does not require an input of tritium or lithium. Unless the tritons are quickly removed, most of the tritium produced is burned in the reactor, which reduces the handling of tritium, with the disadvantage of producing more, and higher-energy, neutrons. The neutron from the second branch of the D-D reaction has an energy of only {{convert|2.45|MeV|abbr=on}}, while the neutron from the D-T reaction has an energy of {{convert|14.1|MeV|abbr=on}}, resulting in greater isotope production and material damage.

Other advantages are independence from lithium resources and a somewhat softer neutron spectrum.

Classical coated membranes gas permeation continues to be the most reliable method to determine hydrogen permeation barrier (HPB) efficiency.<ref name=\":26\" /> In 2021, in response to increasing numbers of designs for fusion power reactors for 2040, the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] published the [https://www.royce.ac.uk/content/uploads/2021/09/UK_Fusion_Materials_Roadmap_Interactive.pdf UK Fusion Materials Roadmap 2021\u20132040], focusing on five priority areas, with a focus on tokamak family reactors:\n* Novel materials to minimize the amount of activation in the structure of the fusion power plant;\n* Compounds that can be used within the power plant to optimise breeding of tritium fuel to sustain the fusion process;\n* Magnets and insulators that are resistant to irradiation from fusion reactions\u2014especially under cryogenic conditions;\n* Structural materials able to retain their strength under neutron bombardment at high operating temperatures (over 550 degrees C);\n* Engineering assurance for fusion materials\u2014providing irradiated sample data and modelled predictions such that plant designers, operators and regulators have confidence that materials are suitable for use in future commercial power stations.\n\n=== Superconducting materials ===\n[[File:SuperOX Wire Production from 2013 to 2021.png|thumbnail|upright=1.5|SuperOx was able to produce over 186 miles of YBCO in nine months for use in fusion reactor magnets, dramatically surpassing the company's previous production targets.]]\nIn a plasma that is embedded in a magnetic field (known as a magnetized plasma) the fusion rate scales as the magnetic field strength to the 4th power.  For this reason, many fusion companies that rely on magnetic fields to control their plasma are trying to develop high temperature superconducting devices.  In 2021, SuperOx, a Russian and Japanese company, developed a new manufacturing process for making superconducting [[YBCO]] wire for fusion reactors.  This new wire was shown to conduct between 700 and 2000 Amps per square millimeter. The company was able to produce 186 miles of wire in nine months.<ref>Molodyk, A., et al. \"Development and large volume production of extremely high current density YBa2Cu3O7 superconducting wires for fusion.\" ''Scientific Reports'' 11.1 (2021): 1\u201311.</ref>\n\n=== Containment considerations ===\nEven on smaller production scales, the containment apparatus is blasted with matter and energy. Designs for plasma containment must consider:\n* A heating and cooling cycle, up to a 10&nbsp;MW/m<sup>2</sup> thermal load.\n* [[Neutron radiation]], which over time leads to [[neutron activation]] and [[embrittlement]].\n* High energy ions leaving at tens to hundreds of [[electronvolt]]s.\n* [[Alpha particle]]s leaving at millions of [[electronvolt]]s.\n* Electrons leaving at high energy.\n* Light radiation (IR, visible, UV, X-ray).\n\nDepending on the approach, these effects may be higher or lower than fission reactors.<ref name=\"Shin Kajita 2014\">\"Thermal response of nanostructured tungsten\"Shin Kajita, et al., January 2014, Nucl.

Materials must also not end up as long-lived [[radioactive waste]].<ref name=\":25\" />\n\n=== Plasma-wall surface conditions ===\nFor long term use, each atom in the wall is expected to be hit by a neutron and displaced about 100 times before the material is replaced. High-energy neutrons produce hydrogen and helium via nuclear reactions that tend to form bubbles at grain boundaries and result in swelling, blistering or embrittlement.<ref name=\"Shin Kajita 2014\"/>\n\n=== Selection of materials ===\nLow-[[Atomic number|Z]] materials, such as [[graphite]] or [[beryllium]] are generally preferred to high-Z materials, usually [[tungsten]] with [[molybdenum]] as a second choice.<ref name=\":26\" /> Liquid metals (lithium, [[gallium]], [[tin]]) have been proposed, e.g., by injection of 1\u20135&nbsp;mm thick streams flowing at 10&nbsp;m/s on solid substrates.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nGraphite features a gross erosion rate due to physical and chemical [[sputtering]] amounting to many meters per year, requiring redeposition of the sputtered material. The redeposition site generally does not exactly match the sputter site, allowing net erosion that may be prohibitive. An even larger problem is that tritium is redeposited with the redeposited graphite. The tritium inventory in the wall and dust could build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a radiological hazard in case of an accident. Graphite found favor as material for short-lived experiments, but appears unlikely to become the primary [[plasma-facing material]] (PFM) in a commercial reactor.<ref name=\":25\" />\n\nTungsten's sputtering rate is orders of magnitude smaller than carbon's, and tritium is much less incorporated into redeposited tungsten. However, tungsten plasma impurities are much more damaging than carbon impurities, and self-sputtering can be high, requiring the plasma in contact with the tungsten not be too hot (a few tens of eV rather than hundreds of eV). Tungsten also has issues around eddy currents and melting in off-normal events, as well as some radiological issues.<ref name=\":25\" />\n\n== Safety and the environment ==\n\n=== Accident potential ===\n\nAccident potential and effect on the environment are critical to social acceptance of nuclear fusion, also known as a [[Corporate social responsibility|social license]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hoedl |first=Seth A. |date=2022 |title=Achieving a social license for fusion energy |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0091054 |journal=Physics of Plasmas |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=092506 |doi=10.1063/5.0091054 |bibcode=2022PhPl...29i2506H |s2cid=252454077 |issn=1070-664X}}</ref> Fusion reactors are not subject to catastrophic meltdown.<ref name=\"McCrackenStott2012\"/> It requires precise and controlled temperature, pressure and magnetic field parameters to produce net energy, and any damage or loss of required control would rapidly quench the reaction.<ref name=afraid>{{cite web |url=http://www.iter.org/newsline/107/1489 |title=Who is afraid of ITER? |first=Krista |last=Dulon |website=iter.org |date=2012 |access-date=18 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130221734/http://www.iter.org/newsline/107/1489 |archive-date=November 30, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Fusion reactors operate with seconds or even microseconds worth of fuel at any moment.

Hydrogen is flammable, and it is possible that hydrogen stored on-site could ignite. In this case, the tritium fraction of the hydrogen would enter the atmosphere, posing a radiation risk. Calculations suggest that about {{convert|1|kg}} of tritium and other radioactive gases in a typical power station would be present. The amount is small enough that it would dilute to legally acceptable limits by the time they reached the station's [[perimeter fence]].<ref name=\"WorldEnergyCouncil\" />\n\nThe likelihood of small industrial accidents, including the local release of radioactivity and injury to staff, are estimated to be minor compared to fission. They would include accidental releases of lithium or tritium or mishandling of radioactive reactor components.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Magnet quench ===\nA [[magnet quench]] is an abnormal termination of magnet operation that occurs when part of the superconducting coil exits the superconducting state (becomes normal). This can occur because the field inside the magnet is too large, the rate of change of field is too large (causing [[eddy current]]s and resultant [[Joule heating|heating]] in the copper support matrix), or a combination of the two.\n\nMore rarely a magnet defect can cause a quench. When this happens, that particular spot is subject to rapid [[Joule heating]] from the current, which raises the [[temperature]] of the surrounding regions. This pushes those regions into the normal state as well, which leads to more heating in a chain reaction. The entire magnet rapidly becomes normal over several seconds, depending on the size of the superconducting coil. This is accompanied by a loud bang as the energy in the magnetic field is converted to heat, and the [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] fluid boils away. The abrupt decrease of current can result in [[kilovolt]] inductive voltage spikes and arcing. Permanent damage to the magnet is rare, but components can be damaged by localized heating, high voltages, or large mechanical forces.\n\nIn practice, magnets usually have safety devices to stop or limit the current when a quench is detected. If a large magnet undergoes a quench, the inert vapor formed by the evaporating cryogenic fluid can present a significant [[asphyxiation]] hazard to operators by displacing breathable air.\n\nA large section of the superconducting magnets in [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider]] unexpectedly quenched during start-up operations in 2008, destroying multiple magnets.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://edms.cern.ch/ui/file/973073/1/Report_on_080919_incident_at_LHC__2_.pdf|title=Interim Summary Report on the Analysis of the 19 September 2008 Incident at the LHC|publisher=CERN|year=2008}}</ref> In order to prevent a recurrence, the LHC's superconducting magnets are equipped with fast-ramping heaters that are activated when a quench event is detected. The dipole bending magnets are connected in series.

This energy is transferred into massive blocks of metal that heat up to several hundred degrees Celsius\u2014because of resistive heating\u2014in seconds.

A huge amount of [[tritium]] could be produced by a fusion power station; tritium is used in the trigger of hydrogen bombs and in modern [[boosted fission weapon]]s, but it can be produced in other ways. The energetic neutrons from a fusion reactor could be used to breed weapons-grade [[plutonium]] or [[uranium]] for an atomic bomb (for example by transmutation of {{chem|238|U}} to {{chem|239Pu}}, or {{chem|232|Th}} to {{chem|233|U}}).\n\nA study conducted in 2011 assessed three scenarios:<ref name=\"ProliferationRisk_Goldston\" />\n* Small-scale fusion station: As a result of much higher power consumption, heat dissipation and a more recognizable design compared to enrichment [[gas centrifuge]]s, this choice would be much easier to detect and therefore implausible.<ref name=\"ProliferationRisk_Goldston\" />\n* Commercial facility: The production potential is significant. But no fertile or fissile substances necessary for the production of weapon-usable materials needs to be present at a civil fusion system at all. If not shielded, detection of these materials can be done by their characteristic [[Gamma Radiation|gamma radiation]]. The underlying redesign could be detected by regular design information verification. In the (technically more feasible) case of solid breeder blanket modules, it would be necessary for incoming components to be inspected for the presence of fertile material,<ref name=\"ProliferationRisk_Goldston\" /> otherwise plutonium for several weapons could be produced each year.<ref name=\"StrongNeutronSources\" />\n* Prioritizing weapon-grade material regardless of secrecy: The fastest way to produce weapon-usable material was seen in modifying a civil fusion power station. No weapons-compatible material is required during civil use. Even without the need for covert action, such a modification would take about two months to start production and at least an additional week to generate a significant amount. This was considered to be enough time to detect a military use and to react with diplomatic or military means. To stop the production, a military destruction of parts of the facility while leaving out the reactor would be sufficient.<ref name=\"ProliferationRisk_Goldston\" />\n\nAnother study concluded \"...large fusion reactors\u2014even if not designed for fissile material breeding\u2014could easily produce several hundred kg Pu per year with high weapon quality and very low source material requirements.\" It was emphasized that the implementation of features for intrinsic proliferation resistance might only be possible at an early phase of research and development.<ref name=\"StrongNeutronSources\" /> The theoretical and computational tools needed for hydrogen bomb design are closely related to those needed for [[inertial confinement fusion]], but have very little in common with magnetic confinement fusion.\n\n=== Fuel reserves ===\nFusion power commonly proposes the use of deuterium as fuel and many current designs also use [[lithium]]. Assuming a fusion energy output equal to the 1995 global power output of about 100 [[exa-|E]]J/yr (= 1 \u00d7 10<sup>20</sup> J/yr) and that this does not increase in the future, which is unlikely, then known current lithium reserves would last 3000 years.

It is expected that second generation plants will move on to the more formidable deuterium-deuterium reaction. The deuterium-helium-3 reaction is also of interest, but the light helium isotope is practically non-existent on Earth.

Trajectories such as pinch designs fell away as they confronted obstacles that have yet to be surmounted. The survivors include magnetic confinement approaches such as tokamak and stellarator, along with ICF devices approaches such as laser and electrostatic confinement.\n\nThe first successful man-made fusion device was the [[boosted fission weapon]] tested in 1951 in the [[Greenhouse Item]] test. The first true fusion weapon was 1952's [[Ivy Mike]], and the first practical example was 1954's [[Castle Bravo]].\n\n=== Early projects ===\n\n==== Stellarator ====\nThe stellarator was the first candidate, preceding the better-known tokamak.

Plasma has a very good [[electrical conductivity]]. This opens the possibility of confining the plasma with [[magnetic field]], generally known as [[magnetic confinement fusion|magnetic confinement]]. The field puts a magnetic pressure on the plasma, which holds it in.  A widely used measure of magnetic trapping in fusion is the beta ratio (plasma pressure/magnetic field pressure):\n\n<math>\\beta = \\frac{p}{p_{mag}} = \\frac{n k_B T}{(B^2/2\\mu_0)}</math><ref>{{Cite book|last=Wesson, John.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52324306|title=Tokamaks|date=2004|publisher=Clarendon Press|others=Campbell, D.
