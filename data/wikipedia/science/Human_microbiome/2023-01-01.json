By mapping the normal microbial make-up of healthy humans using genome sequencing techniques, the researchers of the HMP have created a reference database and the boundaries of normal microbial variation in humans. From 242 healthy U.S. volunteers, more than 5,000 samples were collected from tissues from 15 (men) to 18 (women) body sites such as mouth, nose, skin, lower intestine (stool), and vagina. All the DNA, human and microbial, were analyzed with DNA sequencing machines. The microbial genome data were extracted by identifying the bacterial specific ribosomal RNA, [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]]. The researchers calculated that more than 10,000 microbial species occupy the human ecosystem, and they have identified 81\u201399% of the [[genera]].\n\n=== Analysis after the processing ===\nThe statistical analysis is essential to validate the obtained results ([[Anova|ANOVA]] can be used to size the differences between the groups); if it is paired with graphical tools, the outcome is easily visualized and understood.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Quince C, Walker AW, Simpson JT, Loman NJ, Segata N | title = Shotgun metagenomics, from sampling to analysis | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 833\u2013844 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28898207 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3935 | url = http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/10167/1/NBT_R37313C_line_edit_SJ_1493899923_1_final_for_self_archiving.pdf | hdl = 2164/10167 | s2cid = 19041044 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>\n\nOnce a metagenome is assembled, it is possible to infer the functional potential of the microbiome.

The genetic region is characterized by a highly variable region which can confer detailed identification; it is delimited by conserved regions, which function as [[binding site]]s for primers used in [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. The main gene used to characterize [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] is [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]] [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] gene, while fungi identification is based on [[Internal transcribed spacer|Internal Transcribed Spacer]] (ITS). The technique is fast and not so expensive and enables to obtain a low-resolution classification of a microbial sample; it is optimal for samples that may be contaminated by host DNA. Primer affinity varies among all DNA sequences, which may result in biases during the amplification reaction; indeed, low-abundance samples are susceptible to overamplification errors, since the other contaminating microorganisms result to be over-represented in case of increasing the PCR cycles. Therefore, the optimization of primer selection can help to decrease such errors, although it requires complete knowledge of the microorganisms present in the sample, and their relative abundances.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Knight R, Vrbanac A, Taylor BC, Aksenov A, Callewaert C, Debelius J, Gonzalez A, Kosciolek T, McCall LI, McDonald D, Melnik AV, Morton JT, Navas J, Quinn RA, Sanders JG, Swafford AD, Thompson LR, Tripathi A, Xu ZZ, Zaneveld JR, Zhu Q, Caporaso JG, Dorrestein PC | display-authors = 6 | title = Best practices for analysing microbiomes | journal = Nature Reviews.

The first thing to do in a marker gene amplicon analysis is to remove sequencing errors; a lot of sequencing platforms are very reliable, but most of the apparent sequence diversity is still due to errors during the sequencing process. To reduce this phenomenon a first approach is to cluster sequences into [[Operational taxonomic unit]] (OTUs): this process consolidates similar sequences (a 97% similarity threshold is usually adopted) into a single feature that can be used in further analysis steps; this method however would discard [[SNPs]] because they would get clustered into a single OTU. Another approach is [[Oligotyping (taxonomy)|Oligotyping]], which includes position-specific information from 16s rRNA sequencing to detect small nucleotide variations and from discriminating between closely related distinct taxa. These methods give as an output a table of DNA sequences and counts of the different sequences per sample rather than OTU.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAnother important step in the analysis is to assign a taxonomic name to microbial sequences in the data. This can be done using [[machine learning]] approaches that can reach an accuracy at genus-level of about 80%. Other popular analysis packages provide support for taxonomic classification using exact matches to reference databases and should provide greater specificity, but poor sensitivity. Unclassified microorganism should be further checked for organelle sequences.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Phylogenetic analysis ===\nMany methods that exploit phylogenetic inference use the [[16S ribosomal RNA|16SRNA]] gene for Archea and Bacteria and the [[18S ribosomal RNA|18SRNA]] gene for Eukaryotes. [[Phylogenetic comparative methods]] (PCS) are based on the comparison of multiple traits among microorganisms; the principle is: the closely they are related, the higher number of traits they share. Usually PCS are coupled with phylogenetic generalized least square (PGLS) or other statistical analysis to get more significant results. Ancestral state reconstruction is used in microbiome studies to impute trait values for taxa whose traits are unknown. This is commonly performed with [[PICRUSt]], which relies on available databases. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] variables are chosen by researchers according to the type of study: through the selection of some variables with significant biological informations, it is possible to reduce the dimension of the data to analyse.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPhylogenetic aware distance is usually performed with [[UniFrac]] or similar tools, such as Soresen's index or Rao's D, to quantify the differences between the different communities. All this methods are negatively affected by [[horizontal gene transmission]] (HGT), since it can generate errors and lead to the correlation of distant species. There are different ways to reduce the negative impact of HGT: the use of multiple genes or computational tools to assess the probability of putative HGT events.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Washburne AD, Morton JT, Sanders J, McDonald D, Zhu Q, Oliverio AM, Knight R | title = Methods for phylogenetic analysis of microbiome data | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 652\u2013661 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29795540 | doi = 10.1038/s41564-018-0156-0 | s2cid = 43962376 }}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Bacteria ===\n[[File:Commensals vs pathogens mechanism.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Commensals vs pathogens mechanism. Mechanisms underlying the inflammation in COPD. Airway epithelium has complex structure: consists of at least seven diverse cell types interacting with each other by means of tight junctions. Moreover, epithelial calls can deliver the signals into the underlying tissues taking part in the mechanisms of innate and adaptive immune defence.  The key transmitters of the signals are dendritic cells.  Once pathogenic bacterium (e.g., S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa) has activated particular pattern recognition receptors on/in epithelial cells, the proinflammatory signaling pathways are activated.  This results mainly in IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 production.  These cytokines induce the chemotaxis to the site of infection in its target cells (e.g., neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages). On the other hand, representatives of standard microbiota cause only weak signaling preventing the inflammation.

Their role forms part of normal, healthy human physiology, however if microbe numbers grow beyond their typical ranges (often due to a compromised immune system) or if microbes populate  (such as through poor hygiene or injury) areas of the body normally not colonized or sterile (such as the blood, or the lower respiratory tract, or the abdominal cavity), disease can result (causing, respectively, bacteremia/sepsis, pneumonia, and peritonitis).{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe Human Microbiome Project found that individuals host thousands of bacterial types, different body sites having their own distinctive communities. Skin and vaginal sites showed smaller diversity than the mouth and gut, these showing the greatest richness. The bacterial makeup for a given site on a body varies from person to person, not only in type, but also in abundance. Bacteria of the same species found throughout the mouth are of multiple subtypes, preferring to inhabit distinctly different locations in the mouth. Even the enterotypes in the human gut, previously thought to be well understood, are from a broad spectrum of communities with blurred taxon boundaries.<ref>[http://www.plos.org/media/press/2012/PLoS_%20HMP_Collection_Manuscript_Summaries.pdf PLoS Human Microbiome Project Collection Manuscript Summaries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304161937/http://www.plos.org/media/press/2012/PLoS_%20HMP_Collection_Manuscript_Summaries.pdf |date=4 March 2014 }} 13 June 2012</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/06/12149/consortium-scientists-map-human-bodys-bacterial-ecosystem|title = Consortium of Scientists Map the Human Body's Bacterial Ecosystem|work = ucsf.edu}}</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that 500 to 1,000 [[Species (biology)|species]] of bacteria live in the human gut but belong to just a few phyla: [[Bacillota]] and [[Bacteroidota]] dominate but there are also [[Pseudomonadota]], [[Verrucomicrobiota]], [[Actinobacteriota]], [[Fusobacteriota]], and \"[[Cyanobacteria]]\".<ref name=Sommer2013rev>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sommer F, B\u00e4ckhed F | title = The gut microbiota--masters of host development and physiology | journal = Nature Reviews.

However, only recently, there is emerging literature that an overgrowth of fungus in the small intestine of non-immunocompromised subjects may cause unexplained GI symptoms. Two recent studies showed that 26 % (24/94) and 25.3 % (38/150) of a series of patients with unexplained GI symptoms had SIFO. The most common symptoms observed in these patients were belching, bloating, indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, and gas.&nbsp;...
