Additionally, they found that small, non-semantic (i.e., comments) changes made to code could impact code safety.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Education concerns ===\nA February 2022 paper released by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] evaluates the impact Codex, the technology used by Github Copilot, may have on the education of novice programmers.<ref name=\":1\" /> The study utilizes assessment questions from an introductory programming class at [[The University of Auckland]] and compares Codex\u2019s responses with student performance.<ref name=\":1\" /> Researchers found that Codex, on average, performed better than most students; however, its performance decreased on questions that limited what features could be used in the solution (e.g., [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditionals]], [[Collection (abstract data type)|collections]], and [[For loop|loops]]).<ref name=\":1\" /> Given this type of problem, \u201conly two of [Codex\u2019s] 10 solutions produced the correct output, but both [...] violated [the] constraint.\u201d The paper concludes that Codex may be useful in providing a variety of solutions to learners, but may also lead to over-reliance and plagiarism.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em|content=\n* [[Intelligent code completion]]}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{official site|copilot.github.com}}\n\n{{Differentiable computing}}\n\n[[Category:GitHub]]\n[[Category:Applications of artificial intelligence]]"}
