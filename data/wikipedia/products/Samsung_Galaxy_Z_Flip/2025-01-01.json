Using a glass display results in a more durable screen, and reduces the screen crease in the folding point. The hinge mechanism is strengthened with nylon fibers designed to keep dust out; Samsung rated the fold mechanism as supporting up to 200,000 uses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132345/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-foldable-phone-photos-videos-specs-price-hands-on|title=Hands on with Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip foldable phone|last=Bohn|first=Dieter|date=2020-02-11|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref><ref name=\"Verge1\"/> The device comes in 3 colors for the LTE version which are Mirror Purple, Mirror Black and Mirror Gold. It also comes in 2 colors for the 5G version which are Mystic Bronze and Mystic Gray. However, the color availability may vary depending on country or carrier. The Z Flip is also available in a Limited Edition [[Thom Browne]] model, featuring a red, white, and blue stripe on a gray base.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-z-flip/specs/|title=Specs {{!}} Samsung Galaxy Z Flip|website=The Official Samsung Galaxy Site|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Hardware ===\nThe device uses a [[clamshell design]] to conceal a 6.7\" [[21:9 aspect ratio|21:9]] Dynamic [[AMOLED]] display which supports HDR10+. The screen has a circular cutout at the top of the display for the front-facing camera. The exterior features a small 1.1\" external display adjacent to the camera module, which can display the time, date and battery status, interact with notifications, answer phone calls and act as a viewfinder. The [[Qualcomm Snapdragon]] 855+ SoC and [[Adreno]] 640 GPU are utilized, with 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 256 GB of non-expandable UFS 3.0 storage. It uses two batteries which have a total capacity of 3300 mAh, and can be recharged over USB-C at up to 15W wired or wirelessly via [[Qi (standard)|Qi]]. The power button is embedded in the frame and doubles as the fingerprint sensor, with the volume rocker located above. A dual camera setup on the rear has a 12 MP primary sensor and a 12 MP ultrawide sensor. The front-facing camera has a 10 MP sensor.\n\n=== Software ===\n{{See also|Android 10|One UI}}\nThe Z Flip is pre-installed with [[Android 10]] and Samsung's [[One UI]] 2 skin. [[Split screen (computing)|Split-screen]] functionality, called \"Flex mode\" is supported with certain apps like [[YouTube]] and [[Google Duo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133907/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-google-split-screen-flex-mode-other-foldables|title=The Galaxy Z Flip's split-screen mode isn't just for Samsung foldables, says Google\n|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Peters|first=Jay|date=11 February 2020|access-date=14 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe Z Flip was met with mixed to positive reviews at launch. It was praised for its flagship hardware, form factor, software/UI, display, and camera, but criticized for the price, size of the cover display, and perceived overall fragility. Sascha Segan of ''[[PC Magazine]]'' gave the Z Flip a 3/5, stating that \"the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is the first folding phone to really work, but it's still a costly and potentially fragile fashion object rather than a mainstream hit\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-flip|title=Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Review|work=[[PC Magazine]]|last=Segan|first=Sascha|date=19 February 2020|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nJessica Dolcourt of ''[[CNET]]'' gave the Z Flip a 7.9/10, calling it \"a cohesive device that's easy to pick up and use right away\".
