But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it's usually acceptable. [...] It's also a way to understand the \"hallucinations\", or nonsensical answers to factual questions, to which large language models such as ChatGPT are all too prone. These hallucinations are compression artifacts, but [...] they are plausible enough that identifying them requires comparing them against the originals, which in this case means either the Web or our knowledge of the world. When we think about them this way, such hallucinations are anything but surprising; if a compression algorithm is designed to reconstruct text after ninety-nine percent of the original has been discarded, we should expect that significant portions of what it generates will be entirely fabricated.</blockquote>\n\n===Limitations===\nOpenAI acknowledges that ChatGPT \"sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers\".<ref name=\"OpenAIInfo\" /> This behavior is common for large language models, and is called \"[[artificial intelligence hallucination|hallucination]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://becominghuman.ai/why-large-language-models-like-chatgpt-are-bullshit-artists-c4d5bb850852 |title=Why large language models like ChatGPT are bullshit artists |date=December 16, 2022 |last=Lakshmanan |first=Lak |publisher=becominghuman.ai |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221217075021/https://becominghuman.ai/why-large-language-models-like-chatgpt-are-bullshit-artists-c4d5bb850852 |archive-date=December 17, 2022 |quote=''The human raters are not experts in the topic, and so they tend to choose text that looks convincing.

For 29 of the 39 questions for which there was sufficient medical literature for a data-driven response, ChatGPT failed to provide a direct answer or provided a wrong or incomplete answer (and in some cases, if acted upon, the answer would endanger the patient's health). The researchers had asked ChatGPT to provide medical research citations for all its answers, but it did so for only eight, and all eight included at least one fabricated (fake) citation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Constantino|first=Annika Kim|date=December 5, 2023|title=Free ChatGPT may incorrectly answer drug questions, study says|publisher=CNBC|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/05/free-chatgpt-may-incorrectly-answer-drug-questions-study-says.html|access-date=December 5, 2023|archive-date=December 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231205051814/https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/05/free-chatgpt-may-incorrectly-answer-drug-questions-study-says.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=Study Finds ChatGPT Provides Inaccurate Responses to Drug Questions|date=December 5, 2023|publisher=PR Newswire|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/study-finds-chatgpt-provides-inaccurate-responses-to-drug-questions-302005250.html|access-date=December 5, 2023|archive-date=December 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231205140704/https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/study-finds-chatgpt-provides-inaccurate-responses-to-drug-questions-302005250.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Law====\nIn January 2023, Massachusetts [[Massachusetts Senate|State Senator]] [[Barry Finegold]] and [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Josh S.
