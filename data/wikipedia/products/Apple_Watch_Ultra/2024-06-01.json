Introduced in September 2022, they are marketed towards endurance athletes and [[outdoor recreation]], and carry a [[Rugged computer|rugged]] form factor with a wider band, a larger, brighter display, multi-band GPS, a larger battery, water temperature sensor, and additional functionality for [[Underwater diving|diving]]. \n\n== Hardware ==\n{{main|Apple Watch#Hardware}}\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra hardware is generally similar to the main Apple Watch line (with the first-generation model based on [[Apple Watch Series 8]]), but is differentiated by their rugged titanium casing, a larger 49 mm band, and a larger display with a flat crystal and higher brightness of up to 2,000 [[Candela per square metre|nits]]. It supports multi-band GPS on L1 and L5.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Song |first=Victoria |date=2022-09-21 |title=Apple Watch Ultra review: an aspirational debut |url=https://www.theverge.com/23363948/apple-watch-ultra-review-rugged-smartwatch-gps |access-date=2023-12-26 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref> The Ultra includes a new, orange-colored \"Action\" button, which can be mapped to different functions, as well as an emergency siren feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> Apple Watch Ultra contains a battery 76% larger than that of Series 8, which Apple rated at 36 hours of usage without using power saving modes (as opposed to Apple's rating of 18 hours on the main line). A power saving mode which reduces the amount of heart rate readings and GPS polling can extend its battery life to around 60 hours.<ref name=\":0\" /> All Apple Watch Ultra models include cellular connectivity.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nApple Watch Ultra has a water temperature sensor, and carries WR100 and EN13319 certification. Apple rates the device for diving to depths of up to {{Convert|40|m|ft}}; a new \"Depth\" app is included for displaying depth and water temperature information, while Apple partnered with [[Oceanic Worldwide]] to release the subscription-based \"Oceanic Plus\" app for more advanced [[dive computer]] functionality.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Song |first=Victoria |date=2022-11-28 |title=Now the Apple Watch Ultra can actually be your diving computer |url=https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/28/23481851/apple-watch-ultra-dive-computer-oceanic-plus-app-huish-outdoors-price |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Models ==\nThe first-generation Apple Watch Ultra was unveiled September 7, 2022 alongside [[Apple Watch Series 8]], and began shipping September 23, 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stein |first=Scott |title=Apple Watch Ultra Hands-On: Everything You Need to Know |url=https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-watch-ultra-hands-on-everything-you-need-to-know |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220908094323/https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-watch-ultra-hands-on-everything-you-need-to-know |archive-date=September 8, 2022 |access-date=8 September 2022 |website=CNET |language=en}}</ref> \n\nApple Watch Ultra 2 was unveiled on September 22, 2023, alongside Apple Watch Series 9; alongside the updated hardware inherited from Series 9, its screen brightness was further increased to 3,000 nits.<ref name=\"Chen, NYT 2021.09.14 -- Introduction of Apple Watch Series 72\">{{Cite news |last=Peters |first=Jay |date=September 12, 2023 |title=Apple announces Apple Watch Series 9, and it has a handy double-tap feature |url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23860234/apple-watch-series-9-price-release-date-features |access-date=September 12, 2023 |work=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web |title=Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2: These are the top new features |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/2062755/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-s9-double-tap-gesture-u2-displays-siri.html |access-date=2023-12-26 |website=Macworld |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Peters |first=Jay |date=2023-09-12 |title=Hands-on with the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9 |url=https://www.theverge.com/23866958/apple-watch-ultra-2-series-9-hands-on-pictures-video-price |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref> In December 2023, Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 were temporarily pulled from the U.S. market due to patent litigation by [[Masimo]].

She felt that the Ultra benefitted from the new mapping and compass features (such as BackTrack) introduced by watchOS 9. She noted that Apple's battery life estimations were conservative in comparison to real-world use, where she regularly got closer to 48 hours of battery life during regular exercise use without using power saving modes, and another ''Verge'' staff member reported 56 hours via general, non-fitness use at home. However, she noted that the Apple Watch line still lacked certain features (including longer battery life, offline maps and trail navigation, and [[Transflective liquid-crystal display|transflective displays]]) and fitness metrics in comparison to competitors such as [[Garmin]] and [[Polar Electro|Polar]], but that watchOS still \"runs circles around fitness watches in terms of connectivity and simplicity\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple hardware}}\n\n[[Category:Apple Watch]]\n[[Category:Wearable devices]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2022]]\n[[Category:Smartwatches]]"}
