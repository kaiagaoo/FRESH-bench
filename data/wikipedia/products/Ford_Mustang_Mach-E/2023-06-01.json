It is made mostly from composite fiber, saving more weight over carbon fiber. Based on the performance figures of the upcoming Ford Mustang Mach-E GT, the power of the Mach-E 1400 has been increased to {{cvt|1400|hp|kW PS|0}} and over {{cvt|3118|Nm|0|disp=flip}} of torque, powered by a total of 7 electric motors from a 56.8&nbsp;kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt alloy battery, for high performance and discharge rate, cooled by a di-electric coolant. The power of each electric motor can be adjusted individually within very small margins, and could allow for switching between all-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, and front-wheel drive. The aerodynamics of the prototype allow it to get up to {{cvt|2600|lbf|kN}} of downforce. Regenerative braking is achieved through an electric booster system, accompanied by ABS and stability control to optimize the braking system. The electric prototype also contains Brembo brakes like the [[Ford Mustang (sixth generation)#Motorsports|Ford Mustang GT4]] racecar. The public debut will occur at a [[NASCAR]] race, serving as a test-bed for new materials.<ref>{{Cite web|title=All-Electric Mustang Mach-E 1400 Prototype by Ford Performance and RTR Takes Racing, Drifting to New Levels {{!}} Ford Media Center|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/07/21/all-electric-mustang-mach-e-1400-prototype.html|access-date=September 3, 2020|website=media.ford.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Mustang Mach-E GT Service Vehicles ===\nIn December 2021, New York City announced it was buying 184 Mustang Mach-E SUVs as emergency vehicles.
