The Mac Pro, by some performance benchmarks, is the most powerful computer that Apple offers. It is one of four desktop computers in the current [[Mac (computer)|Mac]] lineup, sitting above the [[Mac Mini]], [[iMac (Apple silicon)|iMac]] and [[Mac Studio]].\n\nIntroduced in August 2006, the first-generation Mac Pro had two [[Dual-Core Xeon|dual-core]] Xeon [[Woodcrest (microprocessor)|Woodcrest]] [[Processor (computing)|processors]] and a rectangular [[Computer tower|tower]] case carried over from the [[Power Mac G5]]. It was replaced on April 4, 2007, by a dual [[Quad-Core Xeon|quad-core]] Xeon [[Clovertown (microprocessor)|Clovertown]] model, then on January 8, 2008, by a dual quad-core Xeon [[Harpertown (microprocessor)|Harpertown]] model.<ref>{{Cite news |date=April 4, 2007 |title=Apple adds 8-core option to Mac Pro |publisher=MacNN |url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/04/04/apple.8.core.mac.pro/}}</ref> Revisions in 2010 and 2012 revisions had [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]]/[[Westmere (microarchitecture)|Westmere]] architecture Intel Xeon processors.\n\nIn December 2013, Apple released the second-generation Mac Pro with a cylindrical design. Apple said it offered twice the overall performance of the first generation while taking up less than one-eighth the volume.<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\">{{Cite web |date=June 10, 2013 |title=At long last!

Thunderbolt 2 ports brought updated wired connectivity and support for six Thunderbolt Displays. Reviews initially were generally positive, with caveats. Limitations of the cylindrical design prevented Apple from upgrading the second-generation Mac Pro with more powerful hardware.\n\nIn December 2019, the third-generation Mac Pro returned to a tower form factor reminiscent of the first-generation model, but with larger air cooling holes. It has up to a 28-core Xeon-W processor, eight [[PCIe]] slots, AMD [[Radeon Pro]] Vega GPUs, and replaces most data ports with [[USB-C]] and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt 3]].\n\n== 1st generation (tower) ==\n[[File:Mac Pro Side.svg|thumb|The first generation of the Mac Pro featured an aluminium case that was derived from that of the [[Power Mac G5]], with the exception of an additional optical drive bay, and a new arrangement of [[Computer port (hardware)|I/O ports]] on both the front and the back.]]\n\nApple said that an [[Intel]]-based replacement for the 2003's [[PowerPC]]-based [[Power Mac G5]] machines had been expected for some time before the Mac Pro was formally announced on August 7, 2006, at the annual [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Kevin |date=2012-06-09 |title=The Best Products Apple Has Ever Announced At Its Annual Summer Developers Conference |url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-announcements-during-wwdc-conferences-2012-6 |access-date=2020-01-22 |website=Business Insider Australia |language=en}}</ref> In June 2005, Apple released the Developer Transition Kit, a prototype Intel [[Pentium 4]]\u2013based Mac housed in a Power Mac G5 case, that was temporarily available to developers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=\"This Is Not a Product\": The Apple Developer Transition Kit |url=https://www.macstories.net/stories/this-is-not-a-product-the-apple-developer-transition-kit/ |access-date=2020-06-25 |language=en-US}}</ref> The [[iMac]], [[Mac Mini]], [[MacBook]], and [[MacBook Pro]] had moved to an Intel-based [[computer architecture|architecture]] starting in January 2006, leaving the Power Mac G5 as the only machine in the Mac lineup still based on the [[PowerPC]] processor architecture Apple had used since 1994. Apple had dropped the term \"Power\" from the other machines in their lineup and started using \"Pro\" on their higher-end laptop offerings. As such, the name \"Mac Pro\" was widely used before the machine was announced.<ref name=\"promacs\">{{Cite web |last=Bangeman |first=Eric |date=July 16, 2006 |title=Peering inside the aluminum ball: Woodcrest, Conroe, and the 'pro' Macs |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2006/07/promacs.ars |access-date=January 10, 2010 |publisher=Arstechnica}}</ref> The Mac Pro is in the [[Unix]] workstation market.<ref name=\"unix\">{{Cite web |date=January 29, 2003 |title=The Unix System&nbsp;\u2014 History and Timeline |url=http://www.unix.org/what_is_unix/history_timeline.html |access-date=January 16, 2010 |publisher=Unix.org}}</ref> Although the high-end technical market has not traditionally been an area of strength for Apple, the company has been positioning itself as a leader in [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear digital editing]] for [[high-definition video]], which demands storage and memory far in excess of a general desktop machine. Additionally, the [[codec]]s used in these applications are generally [[CPU-bound|processor intensive]] and highly [[thread (computer science)|threadable]], which Apple's ProRes white paper describes as scaling almost linearly with additional [[Microprocessor core|processor cores]]. Apple's previous machine aimed at this market, the Power Mac G5, has up to two dual-core processors (marketed as \"Quad-Core\"), but lacks the storage expansion capabilities of the newer design.<ref name=\"promacs\" />\n\nOriginal marketing materials for the Mac Pro generally referred to the middle-of-the-line model with 2 \u00d7 dual-core 2.66&nbsp;GHz processors. Previously, Apple featured the base model with the words \"starting at\" or \"from\" when describing the pricing, but the online US [[Apple Store]] listed the \"Mac Pro at $2499\", the price for the mid-range model. The system could be configured at US$2299, much more comparable with the former base-model dual-core G5 at US$1999, although offering considerably more processing power. Post revision, the default configurations for the Mac Pro includes one quad-core Xeon 3500 at 2.66&nbsp;GHz or two quad-core Xeon 5500s at 2.26&nbsp;GHz each.<ref name=\"usstore\">{{Cite web |title=Mac Pro page at Apple's online store |url=http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/mac_pro |access-date=December 19, 2011 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]}}</ref> Like its predecessor, the Power Mac G5, the pre-2013 Mac Pro was Apple's only desktop with standard expansion slots for [[video card|graphics adapters]] and other expansion cards.\n\nApple received criticism after an incremental upgrade to the Mac Pro line following the 2012 [[WWDC]] conference. The line received more default memory and increased processor speed but still used Intel's older Westmere-EP processors instead of the newer E5 series.<ref>Chris Foresman, [https://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/06/mac-pro-gets-minor-update-with-standard-12-core-option-no-xeon-e5/ \"Mac Pro gets minor update with standard 12-core option, no Xeon E5\"], ''ArsTechnica'', June 11, 2012</ref> The line also lacked then-current technologies like [[SATA]] III, USB 3, and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], the last of which had been added to every other Macintosh at that point. An email from Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] promised a more significant update to the line in 2013.<ref>Jordan Kahn, [http://9to5mac.com/2012/06/12/andy-hertzfeld-the-only-thing-thats-still-high-end-about-mac-pro-is-the-bloated-price/ \"Andy Hertzfield: The only thing that's still high-end about Mac Pro is the bloated price\"], ''9to5 Mac'', June 11, 2012</ref>\n\nApple stopped shipping the first-generation Mac Pro in Europe on March 1, 2013 after an amendment to a safety regulation left the professional Mac non-compliant.

The hard drives were mounted on individual trays (also known as \"sleds\") by captive screws. A set of four drive trays was supplied with each machine. Adding hard drives to the system did not require cables to be attached as the drive was connected to the system simply by being inserted into the corresponding drive slot. A case lock on the back of the system locked the disks trays into their positions.\nThe Mac Pro also supported [[Serial ATA]] solid-state drives ([[Solid-state drive|SSD]]) in the 4 hard drive bays via an SSD-to-hard drive sled adapter (mid-2010 models and later), and by third-party solutions for earlier models (e.g., by an adapter/bracket which plugged into an unused [[PCIe]] slot). Various 2.5-inch SSD drive capacities and configurations were available as options.\nThe Mac Pro was also available with an optional hardware [[RAID]] card.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Apple Introduces New Mac Pro |date=March 3, 2009 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/03/03Apple-Introduces-New-Mac-Pro/ |access-date=January 10, 2010}}</ref> With the addition of a [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]] controller card or SAS [[RAID]] controller card, SAS drives could be directly connected to the system's [[SATA]] ports.\nTwo optical [[drive bay]]s were provided, each with a corresponding SATA port and an [[AT Attachment|Ultra ATA/100]] port.\nThe Mac Pro had one [[Parallel ATA|PATA]] port and could support two PATA devices in the optical drive bays.

The first slot was double wide and intended to hold the main [[video card]], arranged with an empty area the width of a normal card beside it to leave room for the large [[Computer cooling|coolers]] modern cards often use. In most machines, one slot would be blocked by the cooler. Instead of the tiny screws typically used to fasten the cards to the case, in the Mac Pro a single \"bar\" held the cards in place, which is itself held in place by two \"captive\" [[Thumbscrew (fastener)|thumbscrews]] that can be loosened by hand without tools and will not fall out of the case.\n\nOn the original Mac Pro introduced in August 2006, the PCIe slots can be configured individually to give more [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to devices that require it, with a total of 40 \"lanes\", or 13&nbsp;GB/s total [[throughput]]. When running [[Mac OS X]], the Mac Pro did not support [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire]],<ref name=\"sli\">{{Cite web |title=Does the Mac Pro support standard PC video cards?

[[Computer networking|Networking]] was supported with two built-in [[Gigabit Ethernet]] ports. [[802.11]] a/b/g/n [[Wi-Fi]] support ([[AirPort Extreme]]) required an optional module in the Mid 2006, Early 2008 and Early 2009 models, whereas in the 2010 model and later Wi-Fi was standard. [[Bluetooth]] also required an optional module in the Mid 2006 model, but was standard in the Early 2008 and newer models. Displays were supported by one or (optionally) more [[PCIe]] graphics cards. More recent cards featured two [[Mini DisplayPort]] connectors and one dual-link [[Digital Visual Interface]] (DVI) port, with various configurations of on-card [[Video memory|graphics memory]] available.\nDigital ([[TOSLINK|TOSlink]] optical) audio and analog 3.5&nbsp;mm stereo [[mini jack]]s for sound in and out were included, the latter becoming available on both the front and back of the case.\nUnlike other Mac computers, the Mac Pro did not include an [[infrared]] receiver (required to use the [[Apple Remote]]).

It supports one central processing unit (CPU) (up to a 12-core Xeon E5 [[CPU]]), four 1866&nbsp;MHz DDR3 slots, dual AMD FirePro D series GPUs (up to D700 with 6&nbsp;GB [[VRAM]] each), and PCIe-based flash storage. There is a 3\u00d7 [[MIMO]] antenna system for the unit's [[802.11ac]] [[WiFi]] networking interface, [[Bluetooth]] 4.0 to facilitate close-range wireless functions such as music transfer, keyboards, mice, tablets, speakers, security, cameras, and printers. The system can simultaneously support six [[Apple Thunderbolt Display]]s, or three [[4K resolution]] [[computer monitor]]s.<ref name=\"Mac Pro specs at Apple\" />\n\n[[File:Mac Pro desktop.jpeg|thumb|Mac Pro setup]]\nThe second-generation Mac Pro has a redesigned configuration of [[Computer port (hardware)|ports]]. It has a [[HDMI 1.4]] port, dual [[Gigabit Ethernet]] ports, six [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt 2]] ports, four [[USB 3]] ports, and combined digital Mini-TOSlink optical / [[Analog signal|analog]] 3.5&nbsp;mm stereo mini jack for audio output. It also has a headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly selectable within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no dedicated port for inputting audio. The system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to thirty-six Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can concurrently support up to three [[4K resolution|4K displays]]. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six Thunderbolt).

Technical reviewers praised the [[OpenCL]] API under which the machine's powerful twin GPUs and its multi-core CPU can be treated as a single pool of computing power. However, in late 2013 through early 2014, some reviewers had noted the lack of internal expandability, second CPU, serviceability, and questioned the then-limited offerings via [[Thunderbolt 2]] ports.<ref>Dan Ackerman, [http://reviews.cnet.com/apple-mac-pro/ \"Apple's radically remained Mac Pro is a powerhouse performer\"], ''cnet'', December 20, 2013</ref><ref>Jonathan Bray, [http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/desktops/386710/mac-pro-late-2013 \"Mac Pro (late 2013) review\"], ''PC Pro UK'', January 24, 2014</ref> By 2016, reviewers started to agree that the Mac Pro was now lacking in functionality and power, it having not been updated since 2013, and it was past time for Apple to update it.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Byford |first=Sam |title=The Mac Pro hasn't been updated in 1,000 days |work=The Verge |url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/13/12910568/mac-pro-update-when-maybe-never |access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref> Apple later revealed in 2017 that the thermal core design had limited the ability to upgrade the Mac Pro's GPUs and that a new design was under development, to be released sometime after 2017.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Smith |first=Ryan |date=April 4, 2017 |title=Apple to Redesign Mac Pro, Comments that GPU Cooling was a Roadblock |publisher=Anandtech |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11245/apple-to-redesign-mac-pro-gpu-heat-a-concern |access-date=April 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Problems ===\nOn February 5, 2016, Apple identified problems with FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs manufactured between February 8, 2015 and April 11, 2015.

The RAM is expandable to 1.5&nbsp;[[Terabyte|TB]] using twelve 128&nbsp;GB DIMMs. It can be configured with up to two [[Radeon Pro|AMD Radeon Pro]] GPUs, based on [[RDNA (microarchitecture)|RDNA 1]] architecture, which come in a custom MPX module, which are fanless and use the chassis's cooling system. Apple's Afterburner card is a custom add-on, which adds hardware acceleration for [[Apple ProRes|ProRes]] codecs. Similar to the second generation, the cover can be removed to access the internals, which features eight PCIe slots for expansion, making this the first Mac with six or more expansion slots since the [[Power Macintosh 9600]] in 1997.<ref name=\"specs\" /> It can also be purchased with wheels and in a [[19-inch rack|rack mount]] configuration.
