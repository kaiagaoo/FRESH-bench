The XPS line's main competitors{{Clarify timeframe|date=May 2023}} include [[Acer Inc.|Acer]]'s [[Acer Aspire|Aspire]], [[HP Inc.|HP]]'s [[HP Pavilion (computer)|Pavilion]] and [[HP Envy|Envy]], [[Lenovo]]'s X1, [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]]'s [[Samsung Sens|Sens]], and [[MacBook Pro|Apple MacBook Pro]].\n{{TOC right|limit=3}}\n\n== History ==\nThe XPS name was first used in 1990{{Specify|reason=used for what?|date=May 2023}}. At this time, Dell primarily aimed its products at businesses rather than consumers, while [[Gateway Inc.|Gateway]] (then known as Gateway 2000) led the high-end consumer market in the United States. In early 1993, Dell staff met to address how to pursue this emerging market, and it was decided to launch a new high-end product line to compete with Gateway. At this time, Dell's annual revenue was less than $500 million, and founder [[Michael Dell]] was still directly involved in most decisions. [[Vernon Weiss]] was assigned as product manager to lead the project and manage the product marketing, working with Brian Zucker who led on architecture and engineering.\n\nIn September 1993, the first two products in the XPS line were announced, initially as part of the [[Dell Dimension]] series. The first generation of the XPS system was available as either a desktop or a tower case. The new product line was featured on the cover of the October 1993 issue of ''[[PC/Computing]]'' due to its superiority over competitors of the time.\n\nFor the next three years, with Weiss and Zucker continuing to evolve the product line, XPS systems beat the competition in over 100 magazine reviews and covers, being the first to adopt the latest PC technology available and bring it to the consumers at an attractive price{{Fact or opinion|date=May 2023}}.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2001, as Dell grew into a large corporation, XPS lost its leading position in the high-end market as it now had to compete with other manufacturers who had begun to produce computers with high-performance components.\n\nIn 2005, Dell revamped the XPS line to compete with [[Alienware]] (then a separate company, now owned by Dell) and [[Falcon Northwest]]. Dell had considered buying [[Alienware]] since 2002, but finally did so only on March 22, 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2006/11/15/796/dell-buys-acs-to-expand-uk-technology-consulting/ | title=Dell buys ACS to expand UK technology consulting | publisher=[[Financial Times]] | date=November 14, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/127866/article.html | title=Dell Buys IT Services Firm | first=Ben | last=Ames | publisher=[[PCWorld]] | date=November 14, 2006}}</ref> Alienware maintained its autonomy in terms of design and marketing, but access to Dell's [[supply chain management]], purchasing power, and [[economies of scale]] lowered its operating costs.<ref name=\"CNN\">{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/03/24/technology/fastforward_fortune/index.htm | title=Michael Dell on Alienware, growth, and AMD | access-date = 2010-05-25 | last=Kirkpatrick | first=David | date=March 24, 2006 | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine]]}}</ref> The new XPS line initially had the same specifications as those offered by the [[Alienware]] division. Also in 2005, Dell separated its home desktop systems into two lines: Dell Dimension and XPS. Consumer notebooks were also separated into two lines: [[Dell Inspiron]] and XPS.\n\nIn 2008, Dell introduced the \"Studio XPS\" line which it marketed as a performance computer line, while Alienware was advertised for gaming. On June 2, 2009, The M17x gaming laptop was introduced as the first Alienware/Dell joint branded system.\n\n== Desktops ==\n\n=== XPS Tower 8000 series ===\n\n==== XPS Tower (8950) ====\nThe 2022 Dell [https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/xps-8950-desktop/xps-8950-setup-and-specifications/chipset?guid=guid-642dc450-441c-4a82-894b-f0e48e84c89b&lang=en-us XPS 8950] features Intel's 12th-generation i3, i5/i5K, i7/i7K/i7F/i7KF, and i9/i9K/i9KF CPUs.\n\n==== XPS Tower (8940) ====\nThe 2020 [https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/xps-8940-desktop/xps-8940-setup-and-specifications/chipset?guid=guid-642dc450-441c-4a82-894b-f0e48e84c89b&lang=en-us Dell XPS 8940] features Intel's 10th and 11th-generation i3, i5, i7, and i9 CPUs.\n\n==== XPS Tower (8930) ====\nThe 2017 Dell XPS 8930 features Intel's 8th-generation i5 and i7 CPUs on an [[LGA 1151]] socket.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dell.com/community/s/plugins/common/feature/saml/doauth/post?profile.language=en&redirectreason=permissiondenied&referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fcommunity%2FDesktops-General-Read-Only%2FDell-XPS-8930-Tower%2Ftd-p%2F5188308|title=Submit Form|website=www.dell.com|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==== XPS Tower (8910) ====\nDell XPS Towers were released in July 2016.

It contained an Intel [[Pentium III]] CPU, [[SDRAM]], and an [[Intel 440BX|i440BX]] chipset. An \"r\" suffix was used for [[Socket 370]] versions, while no suffix was used for [[Slot 1]] versions.\n\n=== XPS B series ===\nA system that was introduced in 2000. It contained an Intel Pentium III CPU, 128&nbsp;MB of [[RDRAM]], an [[ATi RAGE]] graphics card, and an [[i820]] chipset. An \"r\" suffix was used for [[Socket 370]] versions, while no suffix was used for [[Slot 1]] versions.

It was replaced by the XPS 210, which is nearly identical to its predecessor. The main exception in this case is the upgrade to an Intel Core 2 Duo processor and other minor adjustments.\n\n==== XPS 210 ====\nA small-form-factor case that is 67% smaller than the XPS 410. It does not use full-size PCI slots. The XPS 200 is aimed at being a low-impact machine, meaning it blends in better with the room's features. It is more of a multimedia computer than an actual gaming machine, despite the XPS name. The main difference between the XPS 210 and its predecessor, the XPS 200, is the upgrade to the Intel Core 2 Duo processor line. This makes the XPS 210 faster than the XPS 200.\n\n=== XPS 400 series ===\n==== XPS 400 ====\nThis model was available during late 2005 and the first half of 2006. It was replaced by the XPS 410, which is nearly identical with the exception of an optional Intel Core 2 Duo processor and slightly different audio and video card options\n\n==== XPS 410 ====\nThe former intermediate model of the XPS series and bigger brother to the Dimension E520. It features a base configuration of an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, and a 2.4&nbsp;GHz Core 2 Quad is also available as an option. Other base options include the Nvidia GeForce 7300LE, 7200RPM [[SATA]]-300 hard drive, and dual-channel DDR2 RAM. The case is nearly identical to that of the Dimension E520, with an additional 3.5-inch [[drive bay]] being added. The case is physically taller because of this. The power supply is also slightly more powerful than the Dimension E520 (375 W vs 305 W, respectively and has an added 6 pin PCIe power cable). The XPS 410 replaced the XPS 400. It was replaced by the XPS 420. XPS 410 units were also sold as the Dimension 9200, allowing Dell to continue selling remaining units after the XPS 410 was discontinued.\n\nIn an odd twist, the Dimension 9200 was the final desktop in the Dimension line, effectively making an XPS unit the last in the Dimension family.\n\n==== XPS 420 ====\nNow discontinued, it features similar components to the XPS 410, but it used different case design and new features. This was Dell's media based computer featuring the Dell Xcelerator (a simple and effective Video Recorder), and an LCD screen in the case, running Windows Vista SideShow. As usual with the 4XX Line of XPS's, it did not allow for SLI Graphics. The XPS 420 added support for 45&nbsp;nm Core2 Duo/Quad/ and Extreme CPUs up to the QX9650.\n\n==== XPS 430 ====\nSimilar to 420, with DDR3 RAM and without the LCD on the computer chassis.\n\n==== Studio XPS 435T (or Studio XPS 9000/9100), Studio XPS 435MT ====\nThe Dell XPS 435T was a mid-tower desktop that originally shipped with a Nehalem-based Intel Core i7 processor.  The system's motherboard used Intel's X58 chipset, allowing for 3 memory channels over 6 available DIMM slots.  The XPS 435T is able to support Westmere-based Core i7 and Xeon processors (supporting up to 6 cores) with the latest BIOS update.\n\nThe XPS435MT was a smaller Mini Tower version that shared the X58 chipset. Unlike the 435T, the 435MT's BIOS was never updated to support Westmere-based Core i7 or Xeon chips.  The motherboard is a variation of the MSI 7591 MicroATX.\n\n=== XPS 600 series ===\n\n==== XPS 600 ====\nThe former flagship model of the XPS series that features an Intel dual-core Pentium D 950 processor, dual Nvidia GeForce 7900GTX in [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] mode, 7200 RPM SATA hard drive, and dual-channel DDR2 RAM. This case has not changed significantly over the past several generations, with the large aluminum plate on the front. Discontinued a few days after XPS 700 launch and succeeded by the XPS 700.\n\n==== XPS 625 ====\nA version of the XPS 630 but with AMD Phenom II chips and ATI Graphics.\n\n==== XPS 630 ====\nThis 2008's desktop at one time filled the gap between the media-oriented XPS 420/430 and the high-end XPS 730x. There is no physical difference(s) between the 630 and the 630i. The marketing concept was to use an \"i\" to designate systems installed with an Intel chipset, and an \"a\" for systems with AMD-installed chipsets, but since Intel-based chipsets were the only models ever sold, this designation holds little significance. The 630 features a Dell-modified [[Nvidia]] [[nForce]] 650i chipset that supports both [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] and [[AMD CrossFire|CrossFire]] configurations, but lacks ESA certification (the only ESA-certified component in the 630i is Dell's \"Master Input/Output\" (or \"MIO\") printed circuit board).<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web |url=http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9967348-1.html |title=Q&A: Dell addresses XPS 630 issues {{!}} Crave, the gadget blog \u2013 CNET<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617210521/http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9967348-1.html |archive-date=2008-06-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The XPS 630 at one time came standard with an [[Intel Core 2 Quad]] Q6600 CPU and dual [[Nvidia GeForce]] 8800GT graphics cards.\n\n===== Problems and solutions =====\nThere were several issues with the XPS 630 including problems with the chassis fan control, chassis LED lights, and non-shipment of the LightFX 2.0 lightshow control software.<ref>[http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2008/06/13/dell-xps-630-and-lightfx.aspx Dell XPS 630 and LightFX \u2013 Direct2Dell<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> limited [[PCIe]] slot configuration (8,8,1,1 unlike OEM Nvidia 650i SLI motherboards which also offer the 16,1,1,1 configuration), constant HDD LED activity, and a reliability issue due to a problem inherent in the Nvidia 650i SLI chipset that can surface when overclocking with 4 or more [[gigabyte]]s of RAM. The problems resulted in PC PRO revoking their Recommended award for the system.<ref>[http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/183435/dell-xps-630.html?searchString=dell+xps+630 PC Pro: Product Reviews: Dell XPS 630<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe July 22, 2009 release of a Softex Media Plug-in has provided some of the features originally advertised in LightFX. BIOS updates were issued to patch the constant HDD LED activity. Some 630i owners have bypassed the aforementioned problems by swapping out the Dell-modified 650i motherboard with OEM motherboards such as the EVGA nForce 780i SLI FTW. The motherboard has 8 lanes wired for each PCIe slot, which can restrict performance if using a single high-performance graphics card. Performance is equivalent to other systems with 650i chipset motherboards when using two graphics cards in SLI mode.\n\n=== XPS 700 series ===\n\n==== XPS 700 ====\nTargeted at the gaming community, this model featured the Intel Pentium D Extreme processors in speeds up to 3.7&nbsp;GHz with dual nVidia GeForce 7900 GTX in [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] mode, a 7200RPM SATA hard drive and [[dual-channel]] DDR2 RAM. This desktop was advertised as being overclockable but was not. Dell would later offer a free XPS 720 motherboard upgrade program to all XPS 700 and 710 owners so that these machines could be overclocked with the bios. The aluminum case featured a distinctive \"leaning\" design. The XPS 700 used significantly larger power supplies (750 watt and 1 kilowatt) than the other XPS models to accommodate higher-end video cards and overclocked CPUs. Unlike its forerunners, it used a [[BTX (form factor)|BTX]] motherboard, thereby limiting upgradability. It was replaced by the XPS 710 and many customers were offered a free motherboard upgrade to XPS 720 specification following complaints about the system.<ref>[https://www.engadget.com/2007/08/16/dells-xps-motherboard-exchange-program-goes-live/ XPS 700 Motherboard Exchange Program]</ref>\n\n[[File:Dell XPS 700.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Dell XPS 700]]\n\n==== XPS 710 ====\nThe formal{{clarify|date=May 2023}} flagship model of the XPS series featured the new Intel Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Extreme processors, as well as Core 2 Quad processors. Other features include dual nVidia GeForce 7950 GX2 in Quad [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] mode, 7200RPM SATA hard drive, [[dual-channel]] DDR2 RAM. The XPS 710 uses significantly larger power supplies than the other XPS models to accommodate higher-end video cards and overclocked CPUs. It was replaced by the XPS 720.\n\n==== XPS 720, XPS 720 H2C ====\nAnnounced on November 24, 2007, the XPS 720 is the same as the XPS 720 H2C, except it does not have the \"dual-stage radiator cooling technology.\" It comes in two versions, the Red Special Edition, which is the same as the Black normal one, they both come with a 1&nbsp;kW power supply.\n\nThe [[H2Ceramic cooling|H2C]] edition computer has included a dual-stage radiator cooling technology, and a motherboard capable of overclocking its quad core Intel [[Core 2 Extreme]] QX6800. The H2C comes standard with dual Nvidia GeForce 8800GTX cards running in SLI at a price of $6,780. The XPS 720 H2C uses slightly higher quality parts than other XPS classes. At the time it was one of the most powerful and fastest pre-built systems an individual could purchase by a significant margin.\n\n==== XPS 730 H2C ====\nThe 730 H2C had [[H2Ceramic cooling|H2C]] (a high-performance cooling system) as standard, which was ideal for gaming and overclocking. Its [[motherboard]], the Nvidia nForce 790i Ultra, was capable of overclocking its quad core Intel [[Core 2 Extreme]] QX9770 up to 3.64&nbsp;GHz. Dual channel [[DDR3]] SDRAM system memory was available in [[United States]] and UK.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/xpsdt_730?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs Dell XPS 730 Desktop Gaming PC \u2013 Product Details<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616004857/http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/xpsdt_730?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19 |date=2008-06-16 }}</ref> There was a choice of colors also at some outlets.

This has since been replaced by the XPS 730x (see above).\n\n==== XPS 730X, XPS 730X H2C ====\nReleased on November 16, 2008, the XPS 730X was essentially an XPS 730 with the new [[Intel Core i7]] which also used the new [[Intel X58]] chipset Motherboards.\nThe XPS 730X H2C was the higher-end version of the 730X that made use of [[H2Ceramic cooling]] and often shipped with factory-overclocked Core i7 Extreme Edition processors.\nThe 730X also integrates [[Alienware]]'s AlienFX and a new theatre lighting system. The internals of the 730X have also been redone for ease of upgrades, although most of the inside remains the same. The 730X supported a Tri-Channel of 6&nbsp;GB of DDR3. The graphics card support was either a dual or single [[NVIDIA]] [[GeForce GTX 200|Geforce GTX 285]], or a single ATI [[Radeon HD 4870]] X2. The 730X originally shipped with [[Windows Vista]], but eventually offered [[Windows 7]] near the end of its availability. \nDell internally discontinued the XPS 730X and XPS 730X H2C in its US online store on August 1, 2009 and cancelled any remaining orders after August 15, 2009. It has been mentioned that this was done to focus more attention for customers seeking gaming computers, such as [[Alienware]]. The desktop was officially discontinued on September 17, 2009 (see Dell XPS 730x).\n\n== Laptops ==\n\nDell returned to develop their XPS performance line in 2010, releasing three new laptops in October of that year, which had many new features improved specifications compared to previous models. These included [[JBL (company)|JBL]] speakers with Waves MaxxAudio 3 technology, integrated 3D graphics, the first-ever [[Skype]] certification for video chat, and [[Intel i5]] and i7 processors. Dell also offered a software-based [[Sound Blaster X-Fi|X-Fi]] audio upgrade.<ref>[http://www.creative.com/oem/products/software/x-fimb.asp OEM \u2013 Software Solutions \u2013 Sound Blaster X-Fi MB<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=== XPS 11 ===\n==== XPS 11 (9P33) ====\nDell announced the XPS 11 in June 2013. It features an 11.6-inch screen that can be folded backwards almost 360 degrees to act as a tablet. It shipped with Windows 8.1 and a \"Haswell\" Intel Core i5 processor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040594/dell-announces-xps-11-hybrid-will-ship-with-windows-81.html|title=Dell XPS 11 hybrid strikes a (Lenovo) Yoga pose|last1=Shah|first1=Agam|website=PCWorld|publisher=IDG Communications, Inc.|access-date=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== XPS 12 ===\n==== XPS 12 (9Q23) ====\n[[File:Dell XPS 12 (2012).png|thumb|Dell XPS 12]]\nThe XPS 12 is a [[convertible laptop]]. The convertible mirrors the general aesthetic of the Dell XPS 13 ultrabook and other models in the XPS lineup, although the hybrid swaps out its predecessors' aluminum look for a carbon-fiber exterior. The lid and exterior edge are framed by a machined aluminum edge, while the interior consists of a magnesium-alloy palm rest coated in matte black paint. The Dell XPS 12's body was made with a fingerprint-resisting coating. It possesses a hinged, flip-screen LCD. Applying a push to the top of the screen frees the 12.5 inches, 1920\u00d71080 resolution, 400-nit brightness display from the magnetic locks that hold it in place. The convertible's 1.7&nbsp;GHz Core i5-3317U processor sports Intel HD Graphics 4000 integrated graphics, which combine with 4&nbsp;GiB of RAM and a 128&nbsp;GB solid-state drive and Core i5 processor, but ups the memory to 8&nbsp;GiB and the storage to 256&nbsp;GB. Some models configuration includes the Core i7 processor, 8&nbsp;GiB of RAM, and the 256&nbsp;GB SSD.\n\n==== XPS 12 (9Q33) ====\nIn July 2013, Dell released its XPS 12 with Intel Haswell (4th Generation) processor. This upgrade came as a boost in the Ultrabook's performance as well as battery life. Dell also added [[near field communication]] in this device.\n\n==== XPS 12 (9250) ====\nIn 2015, Dell released a new XPS 12 with Intel Skylake Core M processors. The hinge system was removed and replaced with a fully detachable display. The device has a 4K Ultra HD (3860\u00d72160) display, a kickstand and an 8MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. The new XPS 12 has an all-metal build from the new XPS 13.\n\n=== XPS 13 ===\n==== XPS 13 (L321X, Early 2012) ====\nThe Dell XPS 13 was unveiled at CES 2012. It is the company's first [[Ultrabook]], a term coined by Intel. The XPS 13 features a 13.3-inch screen (1366\u00d7768 Non-Touch Corning Gorilla Glass) and uses flash memory to help with fast booting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keynoodle.com/dell-joins-ultrabook-craze-with-xps-13/|title=Dell Joins Ultrabook Craze with XPS 13|last=Anderson|first=Ash|work=keynoodle.com/dell-joins-ultrabook-craze-with-xps-13/|publisher=KeyNoodle|access-date=11 January 2012}}</ref> The XPS 13 features certain unique design elements.

Compared to its predecessor, the XPS M1710, the model M1730 was physically redesigned with a completely new chassis available in a grey, white, blue, or red. Like the M1710, the M1730 offered unique user- and software-changeable LED lighting in the touchpad, fan outlets/inlets, as well as the lid and speaker grilles. Also like its predecessor, it featured a 17-inch widescreen. From the components angle, it supported overclockable [[Intel Core 2 Extreme]] processors (2.8&nbsp;GHz to 3.4&nbsp;GHz overclocked via the X7900 or X9000 Processor), dual NVIDIA GeForce 9800M GTX video cards in SLI, up to two 7200 RPM SATA hard drives available in RAID, and up to 8&nbsp;GiB DDR2 SDRAM . A [[Blu-ray Disc]] Drive was an option in some models. New with this version was a built in optional [[AGEIA]] [[physics card]] to enable [[PhysX]] enhanced titles take advantage of hardware accelerated physics, the option for 64&nbsp;GB solid state drives, a back lit keyboard including a number pad, and a Logitech gaming LCD display above the keyboard.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\n==== Criticism ====\n\nThe M1730 has been criticized for its increase in weight and size compared to previous models, and for having only marginal performance gains in select games. The last complaint is likely due to a late Nvidia release of a mobile version of the 8800M video card which Dell added to the list of options following the release of the M1730.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\n==== Upgrades ====\n\n[[File:9800M GTX SLI.jpg|thumb|Top view of the M1730 9800M GTX SLI 1&nbsp;GiB VRAM graphics card.]]\nFollowing the initial release of the M1730, the option to have dual 8800M GTX graphics cards in SLI was made available. This is said to have a 174% power increase (as quoted by Dell) over the dual 8700M GTs in SLI which were previously the highest available option.<ref>Message left on Dell website [http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2008/01/29/43163.aspx?~ref=crss Direct2dell.com]</ref> More recently{{when|date=April 2011}} an option to have dual 9800M GT and 9800M GTX graphics cards in SLI has been added to the line.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\nThe 9800M GTX SLI is currently{{Clarify timeframe|date=May 2023}} the highest supported graphics card with 1&nbsp;GiB GDDR3 VRAM for the M1730, as opposed to the 9800M GT SLI and 8800M GTX SLI only with 512&nbsp;MB of available Video Memory and slightly higher amount of stream processors. Thus, performs slightly better than the 9800M GT and 8800M GTX cards. The availability of the 9800M GTX SLI is rare, and may only be purchased in limited Dell direct outlets and on eBay. And in most cases, they are either out of stock, not on sale any longer or selling the previous 9800M GT and 8800M GTX graphics cards.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\n=== XPS M1530 ===\n\nThis 15.4-inch laptop, released on November 28, 2007, features the [[Santa Rosa platform]]. The XPS M1530 is almost identical in design to the XPS M1330 except that it has 4 different colors (blue, black, pink and red) and it is a bit thicker and heavier with a 15.4-inch [[CCFL]] or LED screen. It can be configured with [[Intel Core 2 Duo]] mobile processors up to T7800 (2.6&nbsp;GHz) / T9500 (2.6&nbsp;GHz, 6&nbsp;MiB&nbsp;L2 cache) / X9000 (2.8&nbsp;GHz), up to 8&nbsp;GiB DDR2 SDRAM at 667&nbsp;MHz, up to 320 or 500&nbsp;GB 5400&nbsp;rpm or with faster 160, 240 or 320&nbsp;GB 7200&nbsp;rpm hard drive or an optional 128&nbsp;GB [[solid-state drive|SSD]], and can be configured with a 128&nbsp;MiB DDR2 Geforce 8400GS or 256&nbsp;MiB DDR3 8600M&nbsp;GT GPU. Wireless draft-n is also available ([[802.11n]]). The XPS M1530 includes a biometric fingerprint reader and a 2 MP webcam. Another option for this laptop is a glossy 1920\u00d71200 display, even though it is 9&nbsp;inches smaller than Dell's 24&nbsp;inch monitor.

Dell became aware that the problem was limited to Nvidia chip production, the BIOS was updated to A12 which improves thermal control but does not prevent it from reoccurring. The problem associated with Nvidia GPU's was the chip material used could not stand high temperatures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\n=== XPS M1330 ===\n\nThis 13.3-inch high-end laptop, released on June 26, 2007, features the [[Santa Rosa platform]]. This 13.3-inch screen either with [[CCFL]] or [[LED#White light|WLED]]; the WLED-backlit version has a 0.3 MP camera, as opposed to the 2 MP camera with the CCFL screen, but the model with WLED screen is thinner and brighter than the previous XPS 1210 version. Moreover, XPS 1330 can also feature a biometric fingerprint reader, usually found in business class laptops like the Latitude series. The XPS M1330 also offers the NVIDIA GeForce Go 8400M GS graphics card as an option. Originally, it could only be configured with Intel Core 2 Duo mobile processors up to T7700 (2.4&nbsp;GHz), but could later be configured with processors up to the Intel Core 2 Duo T9500. Noted for its light weight of only 1.8&nbsp;kg, the XPS M1330 is also available in the product red line along with other Dell computers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\nXPS M1330 is no longer available for purchase on Dell's USA website as of early August 2009. It has been replaced by the M1340 (Studio XPS 13).{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\n==== Problems ====\n\nThe most reported issue with M1330 laptops has been overheating. Dell became aware of the problem and found that it was limited to Nvidia chip production G84- and G86-GPU's, as a result, the BIOS was updated to A12, which improves thermal control but does not prevent it from reoccurring.<ref>Message on Dell website [http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2008/07/25/nvidia-gpu-update-for-dell-laptop-owners.aspx Direct2dell.com]</ref> The problem associated with Nvidia GPU's was the chip material used could not stand high temperatures. This problem was exacerbated by poor thermal contact between the chip and the heat pipe (the gap is too big). Some people have overcome the graphics chip over-heating problem by fashioning a heat sink using a copper plate and thermal paste to fill the gap between the heat pipe and the graphics chip.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\nAlso, there have been several cases reported involving M1330 laptops to be cosmetically defective in manufacture, such as loose hinge covers and unusually and uneven gaps between plastic parts, as well as customer complaints concerning \"CPU whine\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\n=== Studio XPS 13 (M1340) ===\n\nSimilar to the Studio XPS 16 but trimmed down into a 13.3-inch 720p 16:10 aspect ratio screen, it has an illuminated [[QWERTY keyboard]] and includes leather accents on the lid. Its full body is piano black and silver.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\nGraphics options are the integrated Nvidia 9400M G (same as used in [[MacBook Air]] and 13-inch [[MacBook]]s) and the more powerful Nvidia GeForce 9500M GE (which is composed of an integrated GeForce 9400M G and discrete GeForce 9200M GS with 256&nbsp;MB of GDDR3 memory). When configured with the 9500M GE you are able to switch between the 9400M G running standalone and the 9400M G with the 9200M GS in Windows Vista, without logging out and back in like you must with Apple products due to the availability of Hybrid SLI.

The laptop could be customized with an Intel Core 2 Duo T2500, T5600, T7400 or T7600 and 1&nbsp;GiB, 2&nbsp;GiB or 4&nbsp;GiB of DDR2 SDRAM @ 667&nbsp;MHz (Although machine can take 2x2 GiB @ 677&nbsp;MHz RAM, it will only operate at 3.25 GiB @ 500&nbsp;MHz due to chipset limitation as well as FSB limitation). The laptop expanded to a full desktop set, including a detachable bluetooth keyboard, bluetooth mouse, and radio-frequency [[Windows Media Center|Media Center]] remote. It was praised for the high quality sound system which included 8 separate \u00be\" speakers below the screen and a 1\u00be\" subwoofer on the bottom of the machine, ported to the right hand side.

The system was marketed to gamers, sharing a chassis design and many components with the lower end Inspiron E1705/9400 and the Precision M90 mobile workstation. The base design featured an Intel [[Core Duo]] processor, NVIDIA GeForce Go 7900GS or [[GeForce 7 Series#GeForce 7900 GTX|7900 GTX]], 7200 RPM SATA hard drive, DDR2 SDRAM, a magnesium alloy case including a 1 inch subwoofer complementing the two treble heavy stereo speakers. User configurable multicolor LED lighting was present in the touchpad, fans, speakers and lid with the ability to have them change color/intensity via Dell QuickSet software or via QuickSet plugins to music with bass giving more red-shifted changes and treble more blue-shifted (an SDK developer kit for custom dynamic link libraries could be obtained for integration to many system processes and even games). Technical support was segregated for the XPS line with access to an \"exclusive\" XPS-branded segment of DELL's business support division. The unit was built on the foundation of a Precision M90 chassis. Later models offered the [[Core 2 Duo]] processor, the Nvidia GeForce 7950GTX GPU, and optional Blu-ray and/or an unlocked Core 2 Duo processor, which could be overclocked \"officially\" to 3.16&nbsp;GHz, although at least 3.5Ghz has been reported as possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.notebookreview.com/news/does-the-overclockable-dell-xps-m1710-deliver/|title=Does the Overclockable Dell XPS M1710 Deliver?|website=www.notebookreview.com|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> As the mainboard used the Intel 945 chipset, the XPS M1710 could not address more than 3.25&nbsp;GiB of RAM though Dell specified \"up to 4&nbsp;GB RAM\". This computer was replaced by the XPS M1730. The chipset although capable of AHCI operation was never implemented by Dell, leaving any future SATA hard drive upgrade paths crippled to IDE legacy operation, protocols, and bandwidth. Further evidence of untapped capacity involves the use of replacing the video cards with a Dell Precision [[GeForce 8 Series#GeForce 8700M GT|Quadro FX 1600M]] (essentially an 8700M GT with comparable performance to the flagship DX9 7950 Go GTX card), allowing for DirectX 10 functionality in a laptop not designed to do so (with the card being unidentified, but the LCD verified by the BIOS, leaving argument that some design foresight was in place for at least a path to using the Quadro FX 1600 and even FX 3600M in this machine in a BIOS revision).\nNote that there are severe overheating problems with the graphics card in this model.,<ref>[http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19247076.aspx Dell Support-Forum thread]</ref> and just like the Precision M90, GPU failures due to cracking in the type of solder used on the Nvidia chipsets to bind them to the substrate were common, and settled via a class-action lawsuit with Nvidia in later years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\n==== XPS M1210 ====\nA high performance ultra-portable (12.1-inch screen) notebook featuring a new case design, Intel Core Duo processor technology, an optional dedicated NVIDIA GeForce 7400 Go video card and an optional integrated web camera (1.3 megapixel). The M1210 also has optional [[WWAN]] (wireless wide area networking) features supporting 3G broadband services. With the standard battery, the laptop weights 1.9 kilograms. Unlike other 12-inch notebook computers, the M1210 features a built-in optical drive rather than an external. This model was discontinued as of July 31, 2007.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\n=== Gen 2 ===\n\n'''Inspiron XPS Gen 2/XPS M170 (2005)''' \u2013 This successor to the Inspiron XPS, had replaced the desktop Pentium 4 with a Pentium M processor, which provided almost the same level of performance as the desktop Pentium 4 and reduced the weight from 9.06&nbsp;lb to 8.6&nbsp;lb. It featured a 17-inch widescreen display at the same resolution as the first generation. Due to the use of a mobile processor, this laptop was thinner and lighter than most other high performance gaming notebooks of its time. It has a design very similar to the XPS M1710. It was initially given the Nvidia GeForce 256&nbsp;MiB 6800 Ultra Go GPU which was a Dell exclusive at the time. The laptop was rebranded as XPS M170 soon after the GeForce Go 7800 GTX was incorporated. The [[Dell Inspiron#Inspiron 9300|Inspiron 9300]] was based on it, being substantially the same laptop with an ATI Mobility Radeon X300 in the base model.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\n[[File:Dell XPS M140.png|thumb|200px|Dell XPS M140]]\n'''XPS M140 (Late 2005)''' \u2013 The lower end model XPS computer that has a chassis identical to a [[Dell Inspiron E1405]] laptop. This model features a choice of several Intel mobile processors, 14.1-inch widescreen and between 512&nbsp;MiB to 2&nbsp;GiB of RAM. This model, being more media-oriented than gaming, does not feature a dedicated graphics card. This model has been replaced by the E1405, a 14.1-inch laptop physically similar the M140. It features the newer Intel Core Duo processors and Intel's 945 chipset. It is no longer classified as an XPS laptop, however.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\n=== Gen 1 ===\n'''Inspiron XPS''' \u2013 The first XPS laptop, which was a rebranded Inspiron 9100, was a very heavy desktop-replacement laptop starting at 9.06 pounds without power supply (which added an additional 2.5 pounds). This was because it was offered with either a 3.4&nbsp;GHz desktop Pentium 4 HT \"Prescott\" processor, or the 3.4&nbsp;GHz \"Gallatin\" Pentium 4 Extreme Edition processor at the same clock speed, which gave off tremendous amounts of heat due to their high clock speeds and inefficient microarchitecture, despite a very large copper-based heatsink that spanned the width of the unit with three fans. Other features included a 1920\u00d71200 15.4-inch LCD, and subwoofer integrated into the bottom of the battery casing, with the 12-cell battery (the 16-cell battery does not include a subwoofer.) Earlier models came with an ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 with 128&nbsp;MB of memory, and later models with the Mobility Radeon 9800 with 256&nbsp;MB of memory. The Mobility Radeon 9800 was based on the R420 core, the same as early ATI Radeon X700 and X800 desktop graphics cards, but with half the pixel pipelines disconnected.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}\n\nA popular{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} modification to the GPU was to bridge two traces in the top right corner of the PCB surrounding the exposed core with a conductive pen to unlock these pipelines. This could only be done on cores made before week 43 of 2004. Dell promised graphics card upgradeability, but only delivered the arguably small 9700 to 9800 step for 9700 owners (at a rather steep $399 price tag, including technician to install it), and never delivered the promised upgrade to the 9800 owners.\n\nThis model also suffers from a whine on the headphone and microphone jacks that are located on the left of the unit. This is because of shared space with the leftmost fan, and the spinning of said fan causes interference.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} There is no known fix than to otherwise use a USB, FireWire/1394 or PCMCIA-based audio device or card for sound output.\n\n== Tablets ==\n\n=== XPS 10 ===\nThe XPS 10 was an ARM-based [[convertible tablet]] with a keyboard stand, similar to Microsoft's [[Surface RT]].<ref>[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/06/dell_xps_10_windows_rt_tablet_and_keyboard_dock_review/ \"Review: Dell XPS 10 Windows RT tablet and dock.\"]</ref> The tablet, which ran [[Windows RT]], was unveiled on August 30, 2012<ref>[http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/secure/2012-08-30-dell-xps-tablet-ultrabook-all-in-one \"Dell Debuts Stunning Additions to XPS Brand: Superb Performance and Design Without Compromise\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222621/http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/secure/2012-08-30-dell-xps-tablet-ultrabook-all-in-one |date=2013-10-04 }}</ref> and discontinued in September 2013.<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/25/4769492/dell-drops-windows-rt-xps-10-tablet \"Microsoft left alone with Windows RT as Dell drops XPS 10 tablet\"]</ref>\n\n== Special Editions ==\nDell has introduced a handful of \"speciality\" models which were based upon particular models in the XPS series, but had unique characteristics. These included custom cases and higher-performance parts (processors, video cards, etc.). Some of these models are considerably rare because they were produced in limited quantities and were either extremely expensive or give-away only (as was the case of the XPS X-Men Edition, see below).\n\n=== XPS 600 Renegade ===\nThe first example of a special edition in Dell's XPS series was the XPS 600 Renegade released in early 2006, which included an Intel Pentium D Extreme Edition 965 processor that was [[overclocking|overclocked]] at the factory from 3.73&nbsp;GHz to 4.26&nbsp;GHz. Despite the overclock, Dell honored Intel's warranty for the processor. The case featured an air-brush paint job completed by Mike Lavallee. Most notably, the machine was the first commercially available system to feature a Quad-[[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] configuration, with four custom NVIDIA [[GeForce 7 Series|GeForce 7900GTX]] graphics cards with 512&nbsp;MiB of memory. It also included a Western Digital hard drive spinning at 10,000 RPM.
