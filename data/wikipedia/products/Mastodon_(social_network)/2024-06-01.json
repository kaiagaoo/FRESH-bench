The servers are connected as nodes in a network, and each server can administer its own rules, account privileges, and whether to share messages to and from other servers. Many servers have a theme based on a specific interest. It is also common for servers to be based around a particular locality, region, ethnicity, or country.<ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ditt lokale sosiale nettverk \u2014 oslo.town|url=https://oslo.town/about|access-date=2020-10-19|website=Mastodon hosted on oslo.town|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=T\u0175t Cymru {{!}} Toot Wales|url=https://toot.wales/about|access-date=2020-10-19|website=Mastodon hosted on toot.wales|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMastodon includes a number of specific privacy features. Each message has a variety of privacy options available, and users can choose whether the message is public or private. Public messages display on a global feed, known as a timeline, and private messages are only shared on the timelines of the user's followers. Messages can also be marked as unlisted from timelines or direct between users. Users can also mark their accounts as completely private. In the timeline, messages can display with an optional [[content warning]] feature, which requires readers to click on the hidden main body of the message to reveal it. Mastodon servers have used this feature to hide [[spoiler (media)|spoilers]], [[trigger warning]]s, and [[not safe for work]] (NSFW) content, though some accounts use the feature to hide links and thoughts others might not want to read.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\" />\n\nMastodon aggregates messages in local and federated timelines in real time. The local timeline shows messages from users on a singular server, while the federated timeline shows messages across all participating Mastodon servers. Users can communicate across connected Mastodon servers with usernames similar in format to full email addresses.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\"/>\n\n=== Content moderation ===\nIn early 2017, journalists like [[Sarah Jeong]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|date=2017-04-04|title=Mastodon Is Like Twitter Without Nazis, So Why Are We Not Using It?|work=Motherboard|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/783akg/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> distinguished Mastodon from Twitter for its approach to combating harassment.<ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\" /> Mastodon uses community-based moderation, in which each server can limit or filter out undesirable types of content, while Twitter uses a single, global policy on [[content moderation]]. For example, the Mastodon instance mastodon.social and several other instances ban content that is illegal in Germany or France, including [[Neo-Nazism|Nazi symbolism]], [[Holocaust denial]], and [[Antisemitism in 21st-century Germany|incitement of violence against Jews]]. Other Mastodon instances, however, can choose to take a more lenient approach to such material. Servers can also choose to limit or filter out messages with disparaging content. The main author of the Mastodon software, [[Eugen Rochko]], believes that small, closely related communities deal with unwanted behaviour more effectively than a large company's small safety team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/we-distribute/one-mammoth-of-a-job-an-interview-with-eugen-rochko-of-mastodon-23b159d6796a|title=One Mammoth of a Job: An Interview with Eugen Rochko of Mastodon|website=medium.com/we-distribute|date=9 July 2018|access-date=5 October 2019}}</ref> Users can also block and report others to administrators, much like on Twitter.<ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\" /><ref name=\"Chan and Wilfred 2023\">{{cite news |last1=Chan |first1=Wilfred |title= Thousands fled to Mastodon after Musk bought Twitter.

Errors in instance configuration and security bugs in server implementation has already led to user data being scraped or changed by attackers. It is worth noting that Mastodon collects considerably less personal data, compared to other social media platforms which makes it a lower-value target and potential losses less significant.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web |last=Goodin |first=Dan |date=2022-11-29 |title=How secure a Twitter replacement is Mastodon?

The testing discovered several vulnerabilities, including one called \"TootRoot\" that would have enabled [[arbitrary code execution]] and another that would have enabled [[cross-site scripting]] attacks through [[oEmbed]] cards. These vulnerabilities were patched in July 2023.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mastodon fixes critical \"TootRoot\" vulnerability allowing node hijacking|first=Dan|last=Goodin|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=July 6, 2023|accessdate=July 6, 2023|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/mastodon-fixes-critical-tootroot-vulnerability-allowing-node-hijacking/}}</ref>\n\nAnother issue can be content moderation.
