This is intended to give users the flexibility to select a node whose policies they prefer, but keep access to a larger social network. Mastodon is also part of the [[Fediverse]] ensemble of computer servers, which use shared protocols allowing users to interact with other users on computers running compatible software packages<ref>{{cite web|url=https://activitypub.rocks/news/mastodon-ap-and-new-cr.html|title=Mastodon launches their ActivityPub support, and a new CR!|website=ActivityPub.rocks|access-date=20 January 2019}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2023}} such as [[PeerTube]] and [[Friendica]].

The servers are connected as nodes in a network, and each server can administrate its own rules, account privileges, and whether to share messages to and from other servers. Many servers have a theme based on a specific interest. It is also common for servers to be based around a particular locality, region, or country.<ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ditt lokale sosiale nettverk \u2014 oslo.town|url=https://oslo.town/about|access-date=2020-10-19|website=Mastodon hosted on oslo.town|language=en}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=February 2023}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=T\u0175t Cymru {{!}} Toot Wales|url=https://toot.wales/about|access-date=2020-10-19|website=Mastodon hosted on toot.wales|language=en}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=February 2023}}\n\nMastodon includes a number of specific privacy features. Each message has a variety of privacy options available, and users can choose whether the message is public or private. Public messages display on a global feed, known as a timeline, and private messages are only shared on the timelines of the user's followers. Messages can also be marked as unlisted from timelines or direct between users. Users can also mark their accounts as completely private. In the timeline, messages can display with an optional [[content warning]] feature, which requires readers to click on the hidden main body of the message to reveal it. Mastodon servers have used this feature to hide [[spoiler (media)|spoilers]], [[trigger warning]]s, and [[not safe for work|not safe for work (NSFW)]] content, though some accounts use the feature to hide links and thoughts others might not want to read.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\" />\n\nMastodon aggregates messages in local and federated timelines in real-time. The local timeline shows messages from users on a singular server, while the federated timeline shows messages across all participating Mastodon servers. Users can communicate across connected Mastodon servers with usernames similar in format to full email addresses.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\"/>\n\n=== Content moderation ===\nIn early 2017, journalists like [[Sarah Jeong]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|date=2017-04-04|title=Mastodon Is Like Twitter Without Nazis, So Why Are We Not Using It?|work=Motherboard|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/783akg/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> distinguished Mastodon from Twitter for its approach to combatting harassment.<ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\" /> Mastodon uses community-based moderation, in which each server can limit or filter out undesirable types of content, while Twitter uses a single, global policy on [[content moderation]]. For example, mastodon.social and several other servers ban content that is illegal in Germany or France, including [[Neo-Nazism|Nazi symbolism]], [[Holocaust denial]], and [[Antisemitism in 21st-century Germany|incitement of violence against Jews]]. Other instances of Mastodon, however can choose to take a more lenient approach to such material. Servers can also choose to limit or filter out messages with disparaging content. The main author of the Mastodon software, [[Eugen Rochko]], believes that small, closely related communities deal with unwanted behaviour more effectively than a large company's small safety team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/we-distribute/one-mammoth-of-a-job-an-interview-with-eugen-rochko-of-mastodon-23b159d6796a|title=One Mammoth of a Job: An Interview with Eugen Rochko of Mastodon|website=medium.com/we-distribute|date=9 July 2018|access-date=5 October 2019}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2023}} Users can also block and report others to administrators, much like on Twitter.<ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rochko |first1=Eugen |title=Learning from Twitter's mistakes |url=https://medium.com/tootsuite/learning-from-twitters-mistakes-c272d67bba76 |website=Medium.com |access-date=7 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181210074855/https://medium.com/tootsuite/learning-from-twitters-mistakes-c272d67bba76 |archive-date=10 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2023}}\n\nAdministrators of servers can block other servers from interacting with their own, an action called \"defederation\".

Some servers support searching the full text of the user's own toots.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/elasticsearch/|title=Full-text search|website=Mastodon documentation site|accessdate=27 December 2022}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=February 2023}}<ref name=\"osint\">{{cite web|url=https://www.secjuice.com/mastodon-osint-a-comprehensive-introduction/|title=Mastodon OSINT: A Comprehensive Introduction|last=Hassan|first=Nihad|date=27 November 2022|accessdate=27 December 2022|website=Secjuice}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2023}} Furthermore, searching for toots will only show results from the Mastodon instance the user is on and from parts of the Fediverse that that instance has cached via federation, not from all toots on all instances.\n\nFor similar reasons, only hashtags can appear in a Mastodon instance's trending topics, not arbitrary popular words, and trending topics vary between instances, since individual instances are aware of different subsets of toots from the whole Fediverse.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\n===Versions===\nIn September 2018, with the release of version 2.5 with redesigned public profile pages, Mastodon marked its 100th release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/09/mastodon-2.5-released|title=Mastodon 2.5 released: Highlights from the changelog|website=blog.joinmastodon.org|access-date=3 December 2018}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=February 2023}}{{So?|date=February 2023}} Mastodon 2.6 was released in October 2018, introducing the possibilities of verified profiles and live, in-stream link previews for images and videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/10/mastodon-2.6-released|title=Mastodon 2.6 released: Highlights from the changelog|website=Blog.joinmastodon.org|access-date=3 December 2018}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=February 2023}}{{So?|date=February 2023}} Version 2.7, in January 2019, made it possible to search for multiple hashtags at once, instead of searching for just a single hashtag.

Errors in instance configuration and security bugs in server implementation has already led to user data being scraped or changed by attackers. It is worth noting that Mastodon collects considerably less personal data, compared to other social media platforms which makes it a lower-value target and potential losses less significant.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web |last=Goodin |first=Dan |date=2022-11-29 |title=How secure a Twitter replacement is Mastodon?
