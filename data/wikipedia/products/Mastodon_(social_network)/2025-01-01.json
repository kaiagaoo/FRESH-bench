The servers are connected as nodes in a network, and each server can administer its own rules, account privileges, and whether to share messages to and from other servers. Many servers have a theme based on a specific interest.<ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\" />\n\nMastodon includes a number of specific privacy features. Each message has a variety of privacy options available, and users can choose whether the message is public or private. Public messages display on a global feed, known as a timeline, and private messages are only shared on the timelines of the user's followers. Messages can also be marked as unlisted from timelines or direct between users. Users can also mark their accounts as completely private. In the timeline, messages can display with an optional [[content warning]] feature, which requires readers to click on the hidden main body of the message to reveal it. Mastodon servers have used this feature to hide [[spoiler (media)|spoilers]], [[trigger warning]]s, and [[not safe for work]] (NSFW) content, though some accounts use the feature to hide links and thoughts others might not want to read.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\" />\n\nMastodon aggregates messages in local and federated timelines in real time. The local timeline shows messages from users on a singular server, while the federated timeline shows messages across all participating Mastodon servers. Users can communicate across connected Mastodon servers with usernames similar in format to full email addresses.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\"/>\n\n=== Content moderation ===\nIn early 2017, journalists like [[Sarah Jeong]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|date=2017-04-04|title=Mastodon Is Like Twitter Without Nazis, So Why Are We Not Using It?|work=Motherboard|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/783akg/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it|access-date=2018-09-21|archive-date=4 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200904073410/https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/783akg/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it|url-status=live}}</ref> distinguished Mastodon from Twitter for its approach to combating harassment.<ref name=\"The Verge: beginner\" /> Mastodon uses community-based moderation, in which each server can limit or filter out undesirable types of content, while Twitter uses a single, global policy on [[content moderation]].

Configuration errors and security bugs in server implementation has already led to user data being [[Scraper site|scraped]] or modified by attackers. It is worth noting that Mastodon also collects considerably less personal data, compared to other social media platforms, which makes it a lower-value target and reduces potential damage.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web |last=Goodin |first=Dan |date=2022-11-29 |title=How secure a Twitter replacement is Mastodon?
