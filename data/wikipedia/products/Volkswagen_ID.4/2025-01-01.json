When driving with the gear selector set to \u201cD\u201d mode, if the driver lifts their foot off the [[accelerator pedal]], the vehicle is set to [[Coasting (vehicle)|coast]] along in order to preserve energy, with the motor freely rotating. However the vehicle can also be set to \u201cB\u201d mode where it will recuperate instead, again with forces of up to 0.25 g. When stronger deceleration is required, the vehicle uses electrically boosted conventional [[hydraulic brake]]s via [[disc brake]]s at the front and sealed [[drum brake]]s at the rear.\n\n=== Battery ===\nThe battery consists of a [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-Ion]] [[battery pack]] which houses 9 battery modules in 10 compartments (Pure models) or 12 modules (Pro models) with each module containing the individual [[Electrochemical cell|battery cells]] (24 per module) in a rectangular aluminium casing which sits in the vehicle's underbody. While the smaller battery holds an energy content of 55 kWh, of which 52 kWh are made available to the user, the larger pack comes in at 82/77 kWh. A model with a 62 kWh gross, 58 kWh net battery pack was released for the North American market in 2022. 82 kWh batteries supplied by [[LG Energy Solution]] originally had a peak DC fast charging rate of 125&nbsp;kW, but was increased to 135&nbsp;kW in an [[over-the-air update]].\n\nThe battery's thermal management system is designed to maintain the battery's temperature around the ideal range of {{convert|25|C|F|abbr=on}} and utilises liquid cooling.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Specifications\n|-\n!

The Standard trim level reduced the base price of the ID.4 to $37,495 (up to $38,995 since December 2022). The larger 82 kWh (gross) battery pack got updated and since December 2022, it is split between two battery suppliers to increase production output, SK On and LG Energy Solution.

All 82 kWh ''AWD'' models get the SK On battery with the 170&nbsp;kW peak charging.
