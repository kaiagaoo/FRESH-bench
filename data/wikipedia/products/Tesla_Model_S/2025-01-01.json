The automaker's longest-produced model and second vehicle, critics have called the Model S one of the most significant and influential electric cars in the industry.\n\nTesla started developing the Model S around 2007 under the [[codename]] \"WhiteStar\". Initially, [[Henrik Fisker]]\u2014known for his work with [[Aston Martin]]\u2014was appointed as the lead designer for the WhiteStar project, but after a dispute with [[Elon Musk]], Tesla's [[CEO]], Fisker was replaced by [[Franz von Holzhausen]]. By 2008, von Holzhausen had designed what would become the production Model S's exterior. Tesla unveiled a [[prototype]] of the vehicle in March 2009, in [[Hawthorne, California]]. To produce the Model S, Tesla acquired a facility in [[Fremont, California]], which was [[NUMMI|previously owned]] by [[General Motors]] and [[Toyota]]. [[mass production|Series manufacture]] of the car officially began at what is now known as the [[Tesla Fremont Factory|Tesla Fremont Factory]] in June 2012. Tesla carried out the final assembly for European markets at [[Tesla facilities in Tilburg|its facilities]] in [[Tilburg|Tilburg, the Netherlands]], between 2013 and 2021. \n\nAll versions of the Model S come equipped with a single-speed [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. The car initially used an [[alternating current]] [[induction motor]], but in 2019, Tesla substituted it with a [[permanent magnet synchronous]] [[reluctance motor|reluctance]] unit. Constructed mostly of [[aluminum]], the Model S shares 30{{nbsp}}percent of its components with the [[Tesla Model X|Model X]]\u2014a [[crossover SUV]] that was introduced in 2015. Over the course of its production, it has undergone several updates, the most prominent ones occurring in 2016 and 2021. These updates have typically included modifications to the motor, such as changes to power or [[torque]], as well as revised exterior elements and refreshed interior features. One such change included the introduction of [[Tesla Autopilot]]\u2014a partial vehicle automation [[advanced driver-assistance system]]\u2014which was released in 2015. To charge the Model S, Tesla operates [[Tesla Supercharger|a network of fast-charging stations]].\n\nIn 2015, the Model S was [[Plug-in electric vehicle#Top selling PEV models|the world's best-selling plug-in electric vehicle]]. It has been [[Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents#Tesla|the subject of multiple fires]], the first in 2013. The car has earned numerous accolades, including being named one of the Best 25 Inventions of the Year 2012 by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and receiving the Tech Car of the Year for 2012 award from ''[[CNET]]''. In 2014, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described the Model S as a \"car that changed the world\".<ref name=\"r288\">{{cite news | title=The top 10 cars that changed the world (and one that's about to) | url-access=subscription | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=December 19, 2014 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/picturegalleries/11304059/The-top-10-cars-that-changed-the-world-and-one-thats-about-to.html | access-date=July 27, 2024 | archive-date=October 13, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231013040955/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/picturegalleries/11304059/The-top-10-cars-that-changed-the-world-and-one-thats-about-to.html | url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Road & Track]]'' argued that, with the introduction of the Model S Plaid\u2014the high-performance version of the vehicle\u2014and features such as the yoke [[steering wheel]], Tesla managed to turn the Model S into \"perhaps one of the worst [cars in the world].\"<ref name=\"a940\">{{cite web | last=Perkins | first=Chris | title=Tesla Model S has lived long enough to see itself become a villain | website=[[Road & Track]] | date=November 3, 2023 | url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/reviews/a45688551/2023-tesla-model-s-plaid-pevoty-review/ | access-date=July 27, 2024 | archive-date=February 29, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240229202216/https://www.roadandtrack.com/reviews/a45688551/2023-tesla-model-s-plaid-pevoty-review/ | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nIn January 2007, a year before the company introduced its first vehicle, the [[battery electric vehicle|battery-electric]] [[Tesla Roadster (first generation)|Roadster]], the American automaker [[Tesla Motors]] opened a facility in [[Michigan]], employing sixty people to work on new projects, including a four-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]].<ref name=\"f115\">{{cite web | last=Rudgard | first=Olivia | title=Catching up with Tesla: How Elon Musk left rivals in the dust | website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | url-access=subscription | date=October 28, 2019 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/10/28/catching-tesla-elon-musk-battling-stay-ahead-car-giants/ | access-date=September 5, 2024 | archive-date=November 17, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231117183915/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/10/28/catching-tesla-elon-musk-battling-stay-ahead-car-giants/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"s729\">{{cite web | last=Mara | first=Janis | title=New electric cars spark interest all over Bay Area | website=[[East Bay Times]] | date=January 27, 2007 | url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/01/27/new-electric-cars-spark-interest-all-over-bay-area/ | access-date=July 28, 2024 | url-access=subscription | archive-date=July 28, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240728054225/https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/01/27/new-electric-cars-spark-interest-all-over-bay-area/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Beginning development under the [[codename]] \"WhiteStar\",{{sfn|Vance|2016|page=272}} Tesla initially planned for the car to have two powertrain options.

Both cars shared a [[chassis]], and the engineers assessed different aspects of the two vehicles, evaluating their positives and negatives. They ultimately preferred the CLS's styling and used it as the baseline for the Model S. After purchasing a CLS, they disassembled it, modified the [[Electric vehicle battery|battery pack]] of a [[Tesla Roadster (first generation)|Tesla Roadster]], cut out the CLS's floor, and integrated it with the battery pack. They subsequently put all of its electronics and systems in the [[trunk (car)|car's trunk]] and replaced the interior.

To save money, Tesla established its design center within a [[SpaceX]] factory\u2014a company also owned by Musk. As von Holzhausen began designing the exterior of the Model S, Tesla engineers initiated a project to construct another electric version of a CLS. They stripped it to its core, removed the body structure, and extended the [[wheelbase]] by {{convert|4|in|cm|spell=in}} to align with early Model-S specifications.
