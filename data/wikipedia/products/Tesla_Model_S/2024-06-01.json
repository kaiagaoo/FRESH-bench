The Model S features a [[Battery electric vehicle|battery-powered]] dual-motor, [[all-wheel drive]] layout, although earlier versions featured a rear-motor and [[rear-wheel drive]] layout.\n\nDevelopment of the Model S began prior to 2007, under the codename \"WhiteStar\". The Model S was officially announced on June 30, 2008, and a prototype vehicle was unveiled in March 2009. The Model S debuted on June 22, 2012.<ref name=\"MSlaunch4\" /> A revised, dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version, known as the 60D, debuted on October 9, 2014. The 60D was followed by the 70D, which made dual-motor and all-wheel drive the standard, followed by the 85D, P85D, and P90D. Along with these updates, Tesla offered the Autopilot driving assistance system. The first major design refresh came in April 2016 when the Model S was updated with a new front hood design. In October of the same year, hardware became standard that supports Tesla's Full Self Driving (FSD) capability. As part of the update, integrated standard cameras around the car were added. In February 2017 the Tesla Model S P100D debuted, which included a revised motor and was the first electric vehicle to have an EPA estimated range exceeding {{Convert|300|mi|km|0|abbr=out}}. The second major design refresh, codenamed \"Palladium\", was introduced in June 2021, offering a new \"Plaid\" performance model, along with a revised interior, powertrain, and suspension.\n\nThe Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking in any country, leading twice in [[Norway]], in September and December 2013<ref name=\"SalesNorway09201322\" /><ref name=\"NorwayTop122\" /><ref name=\"NorwayTop222\" /><ref name=\"NorwayTop322\" /> and in [[Denmark]] in December 2015.<ref name=\"Denmark201522\" /> Sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018.<ref name=\"ModelS200k\" /><ref name=\"Tesla1Q2018\" /><ref name=\"Tesla2Q2018\" /><ref name=\"Tesla3Q2018\" /> The Model S was the top-selling [[plug-in electric car]] worldwide in 2015 and 2016, although it was later surpassed by the [[Tesla Model 3|Model 3]].<ref name=\"US2016record\" /><ref name=\"Top10PEVs2016\" /><ref name=\"Top30PEVs20163\" /> Upon its release, the Model S received positive reviews, with praise for its acceleration and range, although initial models received criticism for their high cost and braking issues.{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Development ==\nThe Model S was developed by a team led by [[Franz von Holzhausen]], who previously worked for [[Mazda North American Operations]].<ref name=\"Wert22\" /> Holzhausen drew upon the design of the [[Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class|CLS]] series of cars.<ref name=\"BBv5T\" /> Codenamed \"WhiteStar\" prior to its official unveiling, the Model S was designed with an electric powertrain in mind, unlike other electric vehicles where the manufacturer swaps out an [[internal combustion engine]] with an electric motor.<ref name=\"lyANz\" /><ref name=\"Perlo3\" /><ref name=\"s4nNJ\" /> As a result, the Model S offers features such as a front trunk (\"frunk\") in addition to a rear trunk and an enlarged [[crumple zone]].<ref name=\"auto123\" />\n\nIn January 2007, Tesla announced plans to build consumer-level sedans starting in 2009;<ref name=\"DPNeA\" /> production was later delayed to 2011.<ref name=\"8tqWl\" /> The Model S was officially announced on June 30, 2008,<ref name=\"NghDl\" /><ref name=\"randt22\" /> and a prototype vehicle was displayed on March 26, 2009.<ref name=\"prototype22\" /> In May 2010, Tesla announced it would produce the Model S at the former [[NUMMI]] plant in [[Fremont, California]].<ref name=\"lGXrY\" />\n[[File:Tesla Model S (108) (cropped).JPG|left|thumb|Tesla Model S prototype at the 2009 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]]]\n\nThe Model S officially launched on June 22, 2012.

The driver stated that he hit something while exiting the [[HOV lane]].<ref name=\"ModelSfire012\" /><ref name=\"NtOG0\" /><ref name=\"nUbuE\" /> Tesla stated that the fire was caused by the \"direct impact of a large metallic object to one of the 16 [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] modules\", and that by design, the modules were separated by firewalls, limiting the fire to \"a small section in the front of the vehicle\".<ref name=\"ModelSfire012\" />\n\nThe module was evidently punctured by a \"curved section\" that fell off a truck and was recovered near the accident. Tesla stated that the debris punched a {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} diameter hole through the {{convert|.25|in|adj=on}} armor plate under the vehicle, applying force of some 25 [[ton]]s. Built-in vents directed the flames away from the vehicle so that the fire did not enter the passenger compartment. According to Tesla, the firefighters followed standard procedure; using water to extinguish the fire was correct,<ref name=\"Model S First Responder Guide2\" /> however, puncturing the metal firewall to gain access to the fire also allowed the flames to spread to the front trunk.<ref name=\"ModelSfire032\" /> Tesla also stated that because the battery pack contains \"only about 10% of the energy contained in a gasoline tank\", the effective combustion potential of a single module is only about 1% that of a conventional vehicle.<ref name=\"ModelSfire032\" />\n\nNHTSA reported, \"After reviewing all available data, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not found evidence at this time that would indicate the recent battery fire involving a Tesla Model S was the result of a vehicle safety defect or noncompliance with federal safety standards.\"<ref name=\"EiIoO\" /> The following month, the NHTSA opened a preliminary evaluation to determine \"the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes on model year 2013 Tesla Model S vehicles\".<ref name=\"NYT111920132\" /><ref name=\"Ntpy7\" /> On March 28, 2014, NHTSA closed its investigation, claiming that the (new) titanium under body shield and aluminum deflector plates, along with increased ground clearance, \"should reduce both the frequency of under body strikes and the resultant fire risk\".<ref name=\"NYTimesFedSafety\" />\n\n==== Subsequent fires ====\nOn November 6, 2013, a fire broke out after a Model S struck a [[tow hitch]] on the roadway, causing damage beneath the vehicle.<ref name=\"NYT1120132\" /> The incidents led Tesla to extend its warranty to cover fire damage and to apply a software update to increase ground clearance when operating at highway speed.<ref name=\"NYT111920132\" /><ref name=\"nydiT\" />\n\nAnother fire took place in Toronto, Canada, in February 2014. The Model S was parked in a garage and was not charging when the fire started. The origin of the fire is undetermined.<ref name=\"oX55P\" /> According to Tesla \"in this particular case, we don't yet know the precise cause, but have definitively determined that it did not originate in the battery, the charging system, the adapter or the electrical receptacle, as these components were untouched by the fire\".<ref name=\"KpYWJ\" />\n\nStarting with vehicle bodies manufactured {{as of|2014|03|06|lc=y}}, all units were outfitted with a triple underbody shield.

In June 2016, the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident, working with the [[Florida Highway Patrol]]. According to NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when a tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the driver and the car failed to apply the brakes.<ref name=\"AutopilotCrash012\" /><ref name=\"AutopilotCrash022\" /><ref name=\"AutopilotCrash032\" /> NHTSA's preliminary evaluation examined the design and performance of automated driving systems, which involved an estimated 25,000 cars.<ref name=\"wZhp3\" />\n\nAccording to Tesla, \"neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.\" The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, \"with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S.\" Tesla also stated that this was Tesla's first known Autopilot-related death in over {{convert|130|e6mi|e6km|0|abbr=unit}} driven by its customers while Autopilot was activated. According to Tesla a fatality occurred every {{convert|94|e6mi|e6km|-1|abbr=unit}} among all type of vehicles in the U.S.<ref name=\"AutopilotCrash012\" /><ref name=\"AutopilotCrash022\" /><ref name=\"cdwBO\" /> In January 2017, NTSB concluded Tesla was not at fault since the driver in the crash had seven seconds to see the truck and take action; the investigation revealed that the Tesla car crash rate dropped by 40 percent under autopilot.<ref name=\"u6Rbz\" /><ref name=\"rPYbx\" />\n\n=== NHTSA safety ===\nOn August 19, 2013, based on NHTSA safety ratings, a Tesla press release claimed that the Model S had achieved the best safety rating of any car ever tested. Tesla stated, \"NHTSA does not publish a star rating above 5, however safety levels better than 5 stars ''are'' captured in the overall Vehicle Safety Score (VSS) provided to manufacturers, where the Model S achieved a new combined record of 5.4 stars.\"<ref name=\"418y2\" /><ref name=\"Dvvxv\" /><ref name=\"PTiTH\" /><ref name=\"JFqj5\" /><ref name=\"cXd32\" /> However, a few days later NHTSA rebutted Tesla's claim, explaining that the rating for the Model S was equal to any other car receiving 5-stars, and claiming that the carmaker did not follow its advertising guidelines.<ref name=\"M1htQ\" /><ref name=\"FzmrD\" /><ref name=\"L7MGk\" />\n\nIn July 2017, the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) found that during front crash tests, the Model S safety belts let the driver's torso move too far forward, resulting in the head striking the steering wheel hard through the airbag. This problem was already pointed out in one of the IIHS's earlier tests, to which Tesla responded they would improve their safety belt design, which, according to the IIHS's latest tests, has not been done. The IIHS also gave the Model S the worst possible rating for its headlights.<ref name=\"nK2Xz\" /> The report caused Tesla to lose 6.4% of its stock value.<ref name=\"MarketWatchPlunge\" />\n\n== Issues and criticism ==\n=== Range limitation ===\n{{update|in the recent decade, the Supercharger network has expanded significantly and the new Model S has a 100 kWh battery pack, which has up to a 405 mile EPA range, one of the best among electric cars|date=December 2022}}\nOn February 8, 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a review by John M. Broder about a trip between Washington, D.C., and Boston using Tesla's Supercharger network. At the time it included only two stations on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Broder made a variety of critical claims about the battery's performance in cold weather and the distance between charging stations. The trip ended with the Model S carried on a [[flatbed truck]] to the [[Milford, Connecticut]], station.<ref name=\"Zu70H\" />\n\nTesla responded by publishing logs of the vehicle's charge levels and driving speed that contradicted Broder's account.<ref name=\"8aP5U\" /> Tesla implied that Broder's behavior forced the car to fail. Broder replied to the criticism, suggesting that the speed discrepancies may have been because the car had been equipped with [[Dub (wheel)|19-inch wheels rather than the specified 21-inch wheels]].<ref name=\"IdEQs\" /> In the midst of the controversy, a [[CNN]] reporter recreated Broder's trip without exhausting the battery. However, two differences distinguished the journeys. The weather was about {{cvt|10|F-change|0}} warmer and CNN completed the trip in one day; the ''Times'' let the car sit overnight while not plugged in.<ref name=\"EVtgU\" /> A reporter from [[CNBC]] also recreated the trip in one day without incidents.<ref name=\"Wu9Xg\" /> One week later, a group of Tesla owners recreated Broder's trip without problems.<ref name=\"qJlVp\" /><ref name=\"nQWR4\" />\n\nOn February 18, 2013, ''The New York Times'' [[Public Editor]] Margaret Sullivan published an editorial stating that Broder took \"casual and imprecise notes\" and used poor judgment, but she maintained that the article was written in good faith.

According to the magazine, Tesla did not take up the invitation to repeat the test, and seemed to refuse to offer vehicles for a second test.<ref name=\"XKzZU\" /><ref name=\"nwva8\" /> A test performed by another German publication (\"[[Die Welt]]\") supported the findings.<ref name=\"CWTKt\" />\n\n=== Power dissipation when not in use ===\nOlder versions of the system software suffered from power drain issues when the car wasn't being used, with the batteries losing 4.5&nbsp;kWh overnight (known commonly as \"vampire drain\").<ref name=\"Nwvcd\" /> System software v5.8 (v1.49.30), released December 12, 2013, reduced overnight energy loss substantially, to 1.1&nbsp;kWh per night, or around 3 miles.<ref name=\"vampire3\" />\n\n=== ''Consumer Reports''<nowiki/>' recommendation ===\nIn October 2015, two months after naming the Tesla 'the best car ever tested,' ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' declined to give the Tesla Model S a \"recommended\" designation, citing too many complaints from owners. Complaints ranged from misaligned doors and squeaky body, to total drive train failure and inoperable door handles. Tesla's shares dropped 15%, both because of the magazine's cut and because of concerns over the Tesla Model X luxury SUV.<ref name=\"CR20153\" /><ref name=\"92Tod\" /> Similarly, [[Edmunds.com]] found quality and safety issues in their long-term road test and \"amassed quite the repair r\u00e9sum\u00e9 during the last 17 months.\"<ref name=\"n7GIq\" /> Both Edmunds and ''Consumer Reports'' reported the vehicle stalling while driving.<ref name=\"jORTg\" />{{better source needed|date=June 2022}}\n\nIn their 2016 Annual Auto Reliability Survey, ''Consumer Reports'' improved the Model S rating to average reliability.
