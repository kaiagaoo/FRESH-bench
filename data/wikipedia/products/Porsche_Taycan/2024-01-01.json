A {{cvt|10.9|in|disp=flip}} screen to the right of the instrument cluster is the car's infotainment center. An optional screen to the right of the infotainment screen allows the front passenger to customise the infotainment system. On the centre console, a {{cvt|8.4|in|disp=flip}} portrait-oriented, touchpad-controlled screen shows the powertrain's status and advises the driver on using the car's power efficiently. In contrast with the all-digital layout, the dashboard features the classic Porsche clock at its top.\n\nThe exterior styling, by former Porsche Exterior Designer Mitja Borkert, is strongly influenced by the Mission E concept car, retaining most of its design elements except the \"[[Suicide door|suicide doors]]\" and [[Pillar (car)|B pillars]]. Design features of the Taycan include a retractable rear spoiler, retractable door handles, and an advanced regenerative braking system. Taking full advantage of its drivetrain layout, the Taycan combines the fundamental short-nosed front proportions of traditional Porsches with the stretched proportions of modern front-engine models towards the rear, providing clear design links to existing models. The front features four-point LED daytime running headlamps. At the rear, the car has a short notchback-style boot lid, housing a full-width light band serving as taillights and turn signals and providing access to one of two luggage compartments. The other compartment is under the bonnet, with a claimed capacity of nearly 100 litres. The Taycan Turbo and Turbo S models include carbon-fibre trim and 20-inch wheels.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nFile:2020 Porsche Taycan 4S 79kWh Rear.jpg|Rear view\nFile:Porsche Experience (48776297423).jpg|Interior\nFile:Porsche Taycan - 2022-08-10.jpg|View from the left side\n</gallery>\n\n=== Taycan Cross Turismo ===\nThe Taycan Cross Turismo is a lifted [[shooting brake]]/wagon version of the Taycan with additional body cladding, rugged black plastic trim, and other [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]]-like features, including an off-road Design package and 'Gravel' drive mode.

The shock absorber mounts, axle mounts and rear side members are forged aluminum; and all body panels, except the front and rear bumpers, are also made from aluminum to reduce weight. 37% of the car is made of aluminium.<ref>{{cite web |title=The body: Intelligent mix of materials for maximum strength|url=https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/taycan/body-18553.html |website=Porsche Newsroom |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Powertrain===\nThe Taycan uses a new battery-electric all-wheel-drive drivetrain with a permanent-magnet synchronous motor on each axle. At the front, power is sent to the wheels through a single-speed gearbox (8.05:1 [[gear ratio]]); and at the rear, through a two-speed transmission and a [[limited slip differential]]. The gearbox has a short planetary first gear (16:1) providing maximum acceleration, and a long-ratio second gear (8.05:1) delivering top speed and efficiency.<ref name=jalop2019-09-06>{{cite web |last1=Tracy |first1=David |title=An Extremely Detailed Look At The Porsche Taycan's Engineering Designed To Take On Tesla |url=https://jalopnik.com/an-extremely-detailed-look-at-the-porsche-taycans-engin-1837802533 |website=Jalopnik |language=en-us |date=6 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230023724/https://jalopnik.com/an-extremely-detailed-look-at-the-porsche-taycans-engin-1837802533 |archive-date=30 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPower comes from a 93&nbsp;kWh {{cvt|1389|lbs|kg|order=flip}} lithium-ion battery pack that doubles as a structural chassis component and keeps the center of gravity low.<ref name=jalop2019-09-06/> To increase rear-seat legroom, recesses called \"foot garages\" have been incorporated in the battery pack.

According to manufacturer estimates, the battery pack can be charged from 5% to 80% in 22.5 minutes in ideal situations, using an 800-volt DC fast charger with {{cvt|270|kW|PS hp|0}} of power. The Taycan is also backward compatible with existing 400-volt stations up to {{cvt|150|kW|PS hp|0}} using an onboard step-up converter that converts the 400-volt system to the car's 800-volt system. Charge times depend on weather conditions and infrastructure. When purchasing a Taycan, owners receive three years free access to the speed-charging infrastructure of [[IONITY]] in Europe or [[Electrify America]] in the United States, Porsche's joint venture partners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.porsche.com/international/aboutporsche/e-performance/charging-on-the-road/ |title=Porsche Charging options for on the road. - Porsche AG|website=Porsche AG - Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG|language=en-EN|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other electric vehicles, the Taycan has charging ports on both the driver's and passenger's sides. They cannot both be used simultaneously. For the European, American and other markets which use [[Combined Charging System|CCS]], AC sources can be connected to either side and DC sources can only be connected to the passenger's side. For the Japanese and Chinese markets which use completely different AC and DC connectors, the driver's side contains the AC charging port and the passenger's side contains the DC charging port. To reduce charge times at both hot and cold temperatures, the battery can be thermally preconditioned using a charging planner. Owners set a departure time in the planner, and the car automatically warms or cools the battery for optimal charging times. A charging dock and mobile charger, supplied with the car for home charging, utilize a 9.6-kW connector that charges the car in 11 hours. An energy manager, which can also be installed in a home's circuit panel, can manage the house's power flow; provide cost-optimising charging using solar power; and provide blackout protection by reducing the charge to the car if household appliances such as fridges or dryers turn on and exceed the panel's power threshold.<ref name=\"cnet\"/>\n\n===Aerodynamics===\nThe Taycan Turbo has a drag coefficient of {{cd|0.22}}, which the manufacturer claims is the lowest of any current Porsche model.
