This method prohibited the use of language associated with explicit content, such as sexual or pornographic themes, as well as extreme violence. Moreover, the system also banned certain individual words including religious and political figures such as \"Allah\" or \"Xi Jinping\". This practice occasionally stirred controversy due to perceived instances of censorship within the Midjourney platform.<ref>{{Cite web |last=McFadden |first=Christopher |date=2023-04-03 |title=Midjourney will no longer let you generate images of Xi Jinping |url=https://interestingengineering.com/culture/midjourney-bans-xi-jinping-images |access-date=2023-05-21 |website=interestingengineering.com |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nCommencing in May 2023, with subsequent updates post version 5, Midjourney transitioned to an AI-powered content moderation system. This advanced mechanism allowed for a more nuanced interpretation of user prompts by analyzing them in their entirety. It consequently facilitated the context-dependent use of words that had previously been prohibited. For instance, users can now prompt the AI to generate a portrait of \"Xi Jinping\". However, the system will prevent the generation of contentious images, such as depictions of global leaders, including Xi Jinping, in situations of arrest.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bastian |first=Matthias |date=2023-05-03 |title=Midjourney now has an easy mode and a new AI moderation system |url=https://the-decoder.com/midjourney-now-has-an-easy-mode-and-a-new-ai-moderation-system/ |access-date=2023-05-21 |website=THE DECODER |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Litigation==\nOn January 13, 2023, three artists&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;[[Sarah Andersen]], Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;filed a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit against [[Stability AI]], Midjourney, and [[DeviantArt]], claiming that these companies have infringed the rights of millions of artists, by training AI tools on five billion images scraped from the web, without the consent of the original artists.<ref name=\"verge2023\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/16/23557098/generative-ai-art-copyright-legal-lawsuit-stable-diffusion-midjourney-deviantart |title=AI art tools Stable Diffusion and Midjourney targeted with copyright lawsuit |first=James |last=Vincent |date=2023-01-16 |website=The Verge |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nThe legal action was initiated in San Francisco by attorney [[Matthew Butterick]] in partnership with the Joseph Saveri Law Firm, which is coincidentally the same team presently challenging [[Microsoft]], [[GitHub]], and [[OpenAI]] (developer of [[ChatGPT]] and image synthesizer [[DALL-E|DALL-E 2]]) in court.
