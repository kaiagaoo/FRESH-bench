To generate images, users use the {{code|/imagine}} command and type in a prompt; the bot then returns an image. Midjourney is also working on a web interface.{{cn|date=October 2022}} \n\n==Uses==\n\nFounder David Holz says he sees artists as customers, not competitors of Midjourney. Holz told ''The Register'' that artists use Midjourney for [[rapid prototyping]] of artistic concepts to show to clients before starting work themselves.<ref name=\"theregister-2022-08\" /> Because Midjourney's [[Training, validation, and test data sets|training set]] may include copyrighted artists' works{{Citation needed|date=December 2022}}, some artists have accused Midjourney of devaluing original creative work.<ref name=\"vice-2022-08\" /> Midjourney's terms of service includes a [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] takedown policy, allowing artists to request their work to be removed from the set, if they believe [[copyright infringement]] to be evident.<ref>https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/terms-of-service {{bare URL inline|date=December 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe advertising industry has been quick to embrace AI tools such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, among others.
