They are Apple\u2019s highest-end option in the AirPods lineup, sold alongside the base model [[AirPods]] and mid-range [[AirPods Pro]].\n\nThe main changes of the AirPods Max over the mid-range AirPods Pro are the over-ear design with larger speakers, inclusion of Apple's Digital Crown (found on the Apple Watch), more color options, and longer battery life.\n\n==Overview==\nApple announced AirPods Max on December 8, 2020 via a website refresh, and released them on December 15, 2020. AirPods Max features an over-ear [[headphone]] design.\n\nAirPods Max have an [[Apple H1|H1 chip]] in each ear cup,<ref name=\"macrumors\" /> which is also found in the second-generation [[AirPods]] and first-generation [[AirPods Pro]]. AirPods Max, like the AirPods Pro, come with Apple's [[Active noise control|Active Noise Cancellation]] technology for blocking outside noise, and Transparency mode for listening to sounds around users. The \"Digital Crown\", similar to that of the [[Apple Watch]], allows users to play or pause audio, control volume, skip tracks, control phone calls, and activate [[Siri]]. [[Proximity sensor|Proximity sensors]] automatically detect when they are on a user's head and play or pause audio accordingly. Spatial audio uses built-in [[Gyroscope|gyroscopes]] and [[Accelerometer|accelerometers]] to track movement of the user's head and provide what Apple describes as a \"theater-like\" experience.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Welch |first=Chris |date=2020-12-08 |title=Apple announces $549 AirPods Max noise-canceling headphones, coming December 15th |url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date |access-date=2020-12-08 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"macrumors\">{{Cite web |title=Apple Announces AirPods Max Over-Ear Headphones With Noise Cancellation, Priced at $549 |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/airpods-max |access-date=2020-12-08 |website=www.macrumors.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Sherr |first=Ian |title=Apple announces $549 AirPods Max over-ear headphones, preorders today, launch Dec. 15 |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-announces-549-airpods-max-over-ear-headphones-preorders-today-launch-dec-15 |access-date=2020-12-08 |website=CNET |language=en}}</ref>\n\nApple claims 20 hours of battery life, with five minutes of charging delivering 1.5 hours of listening time. AirPods Max are charged via the [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning port]]. The Lightning port can also be used for line-in audio, with Apple selling cables with [[USB|USB-A]], [[USB-C]] and [[Phone connector (audio)|3.5mm headphone]] ends.\n\nAirPods Max are bundled with a Smart Case for storing.<ref name=\"macrumors\" /> The Smart Case includes magnets that switch AirPods Max to low-power mode.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lovejoy |first=Ben |date=2020-12-17 |title=PSA: How to switch off AirPods Max without Apple 'bra' case |url=https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/17/how-to-switch-off-airpods-max |access-date=2022-05-21 |website=9to5Mac |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAirPods Max is available in five colors: Space Gray, Silver, Sky Blue, Green, and Pink. Users can select from these five colors separately for the ear cushions and external chassis for a total of 25 color combinations (or 125 if using two different ear cushion colors).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Here Are All 25 AirPods Max Color Combinations You Can Make With Swappable Ear Cushions |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/airpods-max-color-combinations |access-date=2020-12-08 |website=MacRumors |language=en}}</ref> \n\n==Compatibility==\nAirPods Max are compatible with any device that supports [[Bluetooth]], including [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and Windows devices, although certain features  such as [[Siri]] require an Apple device running [[IOS 14|iOS 14.3]], [[IPadOS 14|iPadOS 14.3]], [[watchOS 7|watchOS 7.2]], [[tvOS 14]] or [[macOS Big Sur]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Set up AirPods Max with your Mac and other Bluetooth devices |url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211887 |access-date=2021-07-11 |website=Apple Support |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{AirPods technical specifications}}\n\n== Criticism ==\n[[File:Apple airpods max with case.jpg|thumb|AirPods Max with Smart Case]]\nThe AirPods Max Smart Case's design has been mocked by technology reviewers, along with users on [[Twitter]] for its resemblance to that of a [[bra]] or [[Handbag|purse]].
