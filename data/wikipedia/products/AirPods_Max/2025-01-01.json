They are Apple's highest-end option in the AirPods lineup, sold alongside the base model [[AirPods]] and mid-range [[AirPods Pro]].\n\nThe main changes of the AirPods Max over the mid-range AirPods Pro are the over-ear design with larger speakers, inclusion of Apple's Digital Crown (found on the Apple Watch), more color options, and longer battery life.\n\n==Overview==\n\nApple announced AirPods Max on December 8, 2020 via a press release, and released them on December 15, 2020. AirPods Max features an over-ear [[headphone]] design.\n\nAirPods Max have an [[Apple H1|H1 chip]] in each ear cup,<ref name=\"macrumors\" /> which is also found in the second-generation [[AirPods]] and first-generation [[AirPods Pro]]. AirPods Max, like the AirPods Pro, come with Apple's [[Active noise control|Active Noise Cancellation]] technology for blocking outside noise, and Transparency mode for listening to sounds around users. The \"Digital Crown\", similar to that of the [[Apple Watch]], allows users to play or pause audio, control volume, skip tracks, control phone calls, and activate [[Siri]]. [[Proximity sensor|Proximity sensors]] automatically detect when they are on a user's head and play or pause audio accordingly. Spatial audio uses built-in [[Gyroscope|gyroscopes]] and [[Accelerometer|accelerometers]] to track movement of the user's head and provide what Apple describes as a \"theater-like\" experience.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Welch |first=Chris |date=2020-12-08 |title=Apple announces $549 AirPods Max noise-canceling headphones, coming December 15th |url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date |access-date=2020-12-08 |website=The Verge |language=en |archive-date=December 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208193833/https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"macrumors\">{{Cite web |title=Apple Announces AirPods Max Over-Ear Headphones With Noise Cancellation, Priced at $549 |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/airpods-max |access-date=2020-12-08 |website=www.macrumors.com |date=December 8, 2020 |archive-date=December 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208135741/https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/airpods-max/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Sherr |first=Ian |title=Apple announces $549 AirPods Max over-ear headphones, preorders today, launch Dec. 15 |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-announces-549-airpods-max-over-ear-headphones-preorders-today-launch-dec-15 |access-date=2020-12-08 |website=CNET |language=en |archive-date=December 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208140444/https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-announces-549-airpods-max-over-ear-headphones-preorders-today-launch-dec-15/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nApple claims 20 hours of battery life, with five minutes of charging delivering 1.5 hours of listening time.
