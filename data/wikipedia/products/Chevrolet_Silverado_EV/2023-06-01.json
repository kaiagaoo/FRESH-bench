Introduced in January 2022, the Silverado EV will go on sale in the fall 2023 for the 2024 model year in the [[North America|North American]] market.\n\nDespite using the [[Chevrolet Silverado|Silverado]] nameplate, the vehicle does not share its underpinnings with the [[Internal combustion engine|ICE]]-powered Silverado, as it is built on a narrower version of the dedicated electric [[Car platform|platform]] used by the [[GMC Hummer EV]]. It is the first Chevrolet-branded electric pickup truck after the experimental [[Chevrolet S-10 EV|S-10 EV]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gitlin|first=Jonathan M.|date=2022-01-05|title=Chevrolet shows off the 2024 Silverado EV, its first electric pickup|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/chevrolet-shows-off-the-2024-silverado-ev-its-first-electric-pickup/|access-date=2022-01-06|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nThe [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] counterpart, the '''GMC Sierra EV''' was introduced in October 2022 with a restyled exterior and interior design.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-10-20 |title=2024 GMC Sierra EV Is a Less Extreme Hummer EV and the First Electric Denali |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a41724848/2024-gmc-sierra-ev-revealed/ |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=Car and Driver |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n{{Advert section|date=May 2022}}\nThe Silverado EV was introduced at the [[Consumer Electronics Show#2022|2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES)]] on January 5, 2022. Instead of using the existing Silverado platform, it uses the electric-only BT1 platform with an [[Ultium]] battery. While the wheelbase and overall length are similar to the ICE-powered Silverado, the proportions are significantly altered which enables it to adopt a more aerodynamic exterior design and a forward-shifted cab to increase interior space.<ref>{{cite web|title=2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV Revealed: 400-Mile Range, Up To 664 HP|url=https://www.motor1.com/news/558749/2024-chevrolet-silverado-ev-debut/|access-date=2022-01-06|website=Motor1.com|language=en}}</ref> It is available in a four-door Crew Cab configuration.<ref>{{cite web|date=2022-01-05|title=2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV Debuts With 664 HP, 400 Mile Range, And The Avalanche's Midgate|url=https://www.carscoops.com/2022/01/2024-chevrolet-silverado-ev-debuts-with-664-hp-400-mile-range-and-the-avalanches-midgate/|access-date=2022-01-06|website=Carscoops|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\"media1\">{{cite web|date=2022-01-05|title=The Pickup Reimagined: Introducing the 2024 All-Electric Chevrolet Silverado|url=https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/ces/0105-2024-silverado.html|access-date=2022-01-08|website=media.gm.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAll models are powered by front and rear electric motors with optional 200 kWh battery and uses [[Independent suspension|independent]] front and rear suspension. The truck will initially have a towing capacity of {{cvt|8000|lbs|kg|0|abbr=on}}, but Chevrolet will offer a max tow package that will increase the figure up to {{cvt|20000|lbs|kg|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe truck features a midgate which is similar to the one in the [[Chevrolet Avalanche|Avalanche]], which allows the wall separating the bed from the cab to be lowered in a 60:40 split to increase the effective bed length while leaving room for a rear passenger. The rear glass is removable and can be stored in the folding section, further enlarging the opening. Combined with the tailgate, the 5.9 feet long bed is extendable to 10 feet 10 inches. The front hood hosts a front trunk capable of handling three large suitcases.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |last=Lago |first=Carlos |date=2022-01-05 |title=2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV Revealed with 664 HP, 400-Mile Range |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a38594208/2024-chevrolet-silverado-ev-revealed/ |access-date=2022-01-06 |website=Car and Driver |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nProduction will start in the Factory Zero assembly plant (formerly [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly|Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly]]) in the second quarter of 2023.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Trim levels ==\n[[File:2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV.jpg|left|thumb|2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV with its [[Trunk (car)|trunk]] being opened (otherwise known as a [[frunk]])]]\nTwo trim levels were available at its introduction, which are the base, fleet-oriented WT (work truck) and the flagship RST First Edition, while other trim levels between them will be released later. The WT has a power output of {{cvt|510|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|615|lbft|Nm kgm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} of torque, while the RST offers a power output of {{cvt|664|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|780|lbft|Nm kgm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.\n\nThe WT trim features a more basic appearance, silver-painted steel wheels, black front and rear bumpers and exterior accents, and a vinyl interior with rubberized floors, while the RST features a sporty appearance with large [[Aluminium alloy|aluminum-alloy]] wheels, color-keyed front and rear bumpers and exterior accents, a luxury leather-trimmed interior, and carpeted flooring with front and rear floor mats. Both models include a [[touchscreen]] [[infotainment system]] with [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] [[smartphone]] integration, as well as a large [[Thin Film Transistor]] (TFT) reconfigurable [[LCD]] full-color instrument cluster display screen. Also standard on both models are [[LED]] front [[headlamps]] and a dual-zone automatic climate control system. \n\nThe RST First Edition trim features a drive mode called Wide Open Watts, that enables {{convert|0-100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} time in less than 4.5 seconds. It also will come equipped with 24-inch wheels, four-wheel steering, an [[adaptive air suspension]] that can raise or lower the model up to {{cvt|2|in|mm|0|abbr=}}, and a Super Cruise [[Semi-autonomous driving|semi-autonomous]] driving system.\n\nGM expects about 400 miles of range on a full charge from both the WT and RST trims. The WT model is expected to arrive in spring of 2023, whereas the RST First Edition model will arrive in fall of 2023. Additional trim levels, such as the off-road oriented Trail Boss, will also debut in the future.<ref name=\"media1\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons cat}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://www.gmc.com/gmc-life/news/electric-sierra-denali Sierra Denali EV] (twin model)\n\n{{Chevrolet vehicles}}\n{{Chevrolet trucks timeline (North America) 1980 to date}}\n{{GMC vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Chevrolet trucks|Silverado EV]]\n[[Category:Pickup trucks]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2022]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Upcoming car models]]\n[[Category:Electric trucks]]"}
