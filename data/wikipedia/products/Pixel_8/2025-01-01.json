They serve as the successors to the [[Pixel 7]] and [[Pixel 7 Pro]], respectively. Visually, the phones resemble their respective predecessors, with incremental upgrades to their displays and performance. Powered by the third-generation [[Google Tensor]] [[system-on-chip]], Google placed heavy emphasis on their [[artificial intelligence]]\u2013powered features, especially in the realm of [[generative AI]] and [[Image editing|photo editing]].\n\nThe Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro were officially announced on October 4, 2023, at the annual [[Made by Google]] event and were released in the United States<!--Do not add other countries, this is an American product--> on October 12. They received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised both the hardware and software despite their modest upgrades. The phones' AI features, Google's historic promise of seven years of [[software updates]], and the Pro model's unconventional inclusion of a [[Infrared thermometer|temperature sensor]] received significant attention and was heavily scrutinized, drawing mixed reactions.\n\n== History ==\nIn May 2023, ''[[9to5Google]]'' reported that Google intended to launch the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro in late 2023.<ref name=\"PixelWatch2\" /> The phones were approved by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in August of that year.<ref name=\"FCC\" /> After previewing the phones in September,<ref name=\"Preview\" /> Google officially announced the phones on October 4, alongside the [[Pixel Watch 2]], at the annual [[Made by Google]] event.<ref name=\"Announcement\" /> Pre-orders became available the same day,<ref name=\"CNNHandsOn\" /> and the phones became available in 21 countries on October 12.<ref name=\"ArsLaunch\" /><ref name=\"Belgium\" /> Google hardware chief [[Rick Osterloh]] announced later that month that the company would begin manufacturing its Pixel phones in India beginning in 2024 with the Pixel 8, following [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s lead with the [[iPhone 15]] series.

A series of commercials, produced in collaboration with Robot Agency, featured numerous NBA athletes and personalities such as [[Jimmy Butler]], [[Giannis Antetokounmpo]], [[Thanasis Antetokounmpo]], [[Chiney Ogwumike]], [[Flau'jae Johnson]], Jamad Fiin, Chris Brickley, Cameron Look, [[Richard Jefferson]], and [[Crissa Jackson]].<ref name=\"NBA9to5\" /><ref name=\"NBASBJ\" /> Google also collaborated with ''[[The New York Times]]'' to capture [[Street style|street-style]] video for the publication's \"Style Outside\" column.<ref name=\"StyleOutsideNYT\" /><ref name=\"StyleOutsideGlossy\" />\n\nTo promote the introduction of the \"Mint\" color in January 2024, Google partnered with street artist Ricardo Gonzalez to paint over a Pixel 8 billboard in New York City.<ref name=\"Mural\" /> In February 2024, Google released a commercial titled \"Javier in Frame\" which advertised the Pixel 8's Guided Frame feature, ahead of its airing during [[Super Bowl LVIII]]. Directed by Adam Morse and telling the story of a blind man named Javier who uses Guided Frame to \"document important moments in his life\", the 60-second commercial marked Google's third [[Super Bowl commercial|Super Bowl spot]] in a row to market the Pixel.<ref name=\"JavierAdAge\" /><ref name=\"JavierAdweek\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical response ===\nIn early reactions, three aspects particularly piqued commentators' interest: the Pixel 8 Pro's temperature sensor, Google's promise of seven years of updates, and the heavy emphasis on AI. The temperature sensor drew varied reactions: some found it a potentially useful novelty,<ref name=\"CNNHandsOn\" /><ref name=\"TCImpressions\" /><ref name=\"EngadgetHandsOn\" /> while others were bewildered and dismissed it as a strange gimmick.<ref name=\"ArsLaunch\" /><ref name=\"MashableLaunch\" /><ref name=\"WhatsUp\" /> The response to Google's seven-year pledge was similarly divided: several journalists welcomed the move, hailing it as astonishing and monumental;<ref name=\"BiggestThing\" /><ref name=\"YourMove\" /><ref name=\"Rejoice\" /> others questioned whether Google would fulfill its promise.<ref name=\"Meaningless\" /><ref name=\"Trust\" /><ref name=\"GettingWeird\" />\n\n''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'s}} Chris Velazco opined that the phones reflected \"a deepening obsession with AI\",<ref name=\"Obsession\" /> with ''The Verge''{{'s}} Jon Porter describing the launch event as \"a parade of AI\", observing that the phrase \"AI\" had been invoked over fifty times.<ref name=\"Parade\" /> As the Pixel 8 was \"the first mainstream phone to bake generative AI directly into the photo creation process at no extra cost\", computer science professor [[Ren Ng]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] described it as a pivotal milestone in the area of imagery.<ref name=\"UhOh\" /> Nicole Nguyen of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' raised concerns with the implications of the Pixel 8's [[Image editing|photo editing]] features, fearing that it could lead to an influx in \"[[fauxtography]]\", the malicious manipulation of photographs.<ref name=\"Fauxtography\" /> The AI features themselves received mixed responses.
