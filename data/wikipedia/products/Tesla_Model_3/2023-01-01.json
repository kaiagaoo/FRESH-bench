finish on the two demo cars we saw\u2014perhaps not surprisingly\u2014was relatively poor.\" He said that there were quality issues at first with the Model X which led to some concern. \"This is going to be a much, much higher-volume car, and if there are any quality issues, that could overwhelm the service centers and undermine the Tesla brand.\" Nonetheless, Sacconaghi was impressed with the ride quality, performance and interior space, and concluded that the 3 \"risks cannibalizing the [much more expensive] Model S going forward.\"<ref>{{cite
