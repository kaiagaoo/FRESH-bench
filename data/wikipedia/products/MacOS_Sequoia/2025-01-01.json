It was announced at [[Worldwide Developers Conference#2024|WWDC 2024]] on June 10, 2024.<ref name=\"TheVergeInfo\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24173603/wwdc-2024-live-blog-apple-event-ios-18-ai |title=Apple's AI plans, iOS 18, and more at WWDC 2024 |date=June 10, 2024 |work=[[The Verge]] |access-date=June 10, 2024}}</ref> In line with Apple's practice of naming macOS releases after landmarks in [[California]], it is named after [[Sequoia National Park]], located in the [[Sierra Nevada]] mountain range.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Terech |first1=Kristina |last2=Hanson |first2=Matt |last3=Saxena |first3=Muskaan |date=2024-06-07 |title=macOS 15 Sequoia: launch date, latest news, rumors, and everything we know |url=https://www.techradar.com/computing/mac-os/macos-15 |access-date=2024-06-10 |work=TechRadar |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe first developer beta was released on June 10, 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-06-10 |title=Apple Releases First Betas of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, tvOS 18, watchOS 11, and visionOS 2 |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-first-developer-betas-new-software/ |access-date=2024-06-15 |website=MacRumors |language=en}}</ref> The first public beta was released on July 15, 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-15 |title=Apple Releases First macOS Sequoia Public Beta With iPhone Mirroring and More |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-releases-macos-sequoia-public-beta/ |access-date=2024-07-16 |website=MacRumors |language=en}}</ref> It was released on September 16, 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-16 |title=Apple Launches macOS Sequoia With iPhone Mirroring, Passwords App, Window Tiling Updates and More |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/apple-releases-macos-sequoia/ |access-date=2024-09-16 |website=MacRumors |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nmacOS Sequoia was announced by Senior Vice President of Software Engineering [[Craig Federighi]] at Apple's [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC) on June 10, 2024.<ref name=\"TheVergeInfo\"/> It was announced alongside [[iOS 18]], [[iPadOS 18]] and [[watchOS 11]].<ref>{{Cite press release |title=WWDC24 Highlights |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/wwdc24-highlights/ |access-date=2024-12-18 |website=Apple Newsroom}}</ref> 8 developer betas and 6 public betas were released.\n\n== Features ==\nmacOS Sequoia introduced several new features and improvements, mainly focused on productivity:\n\n* iPhone Mirroring, a feature to mirror and interact with content from an [[iPhone]] running [[iOS 18]] as a macOS window, has been introduced. It is supported on all Macs except the 2019 iMac, which lacks a [[Apple T2|T2 chip]].<ref name=\"TheVergeInfo\" /> This function is not available in the [[European Union]] due to the lack of conformity to the [[Digital Markets Act]] (DMA).<ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183251/apple-eu-delay-ai-screen-mirroring-shareplay-dma | title = Apple may delay AI features in the EU because of its big tech law | last = Lawler | first = Richard | date = June 21, 2024 | access-date = September 23, 2024 | work = [[The Verge]]}}</ref>\n* The [[Calculator (Apple)|Calculator]] app has been redesigned to be more similar to that of [[iOS]] and [[iPadOS]], including rounded buttons, departing from the design that has been used since [[OS X Yosemite]].\n* [[Notes (Apple)|Notes]] has been updated with the Math Notes feature, which can be used to calculate simple equations, evaluate expressions, and assign variables within the app.\n* [[Passwords (Apple)|Passwords]], a [[Cross-platform software|cross-platform]] [[password manager]] application, was introduced, which replaces [[Keychain (software)|Keychain]].<ref name=\"TheVergeInfo\" />\n* In [[System Settings]], individual menus have been rearranged and slightly redesigned to quickly access frequently used menus.\n* [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] has been revamped, including revamped reader mode (now called Reader), faster page load times, a new start page, a new option to hide a singular element on a webpage, and a brand new unified menu; these had previously been exclusive to compact mode on iOS/iPadOS.\n* macOS Sequoia includes the second iteration of [[Game Porting Toolkit]], a [[Windows API]] [[compatibility layer]] derived from [[Wine (software)|Wine]] and [[Crossover (software)|Crossover]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Warren |first1=Tom |title=Apple's new Proton-like tool can run Windows games on a Mac |url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23752164/apple-mac-gaming-game-porting-toolkit-windows-games-macos |website=The Verge |access-date=25 June 2024 |language=en |date=7 June 2023}}</ref> allowing developers to more easily port Windows games to macOS.<ref name=\"TheVergeInfo\" />\n* [[Apple Intelligence]] is available on all [[Apple silicon]] Macs and includes [[artificial intelligence]] features such as a revamped and redesigned [[Siri]], Writing Tools with which selected text can be proofread or have its tone changed, Smart Reply in [[Apple Mail|Mail]] to quickly draft email responses, and a system-wide integration with [[ChatGPT]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Apple Intelligence Preview |url=https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/ |access-date=2024-06-14 |website=Apple |language=en-US}}</ref>\n* Window tiling is now automatically suggested by macOS when dragging a window to the edges of the display, similar to the [[Windows Aero#Aero snap|Aero Snap]] feature included in [[Microsoft Windows]].\n* The Tips app is now an independent app from the rest of the operating system. The user interface (UI) has also been redesigned, and has replaced the previous Help system included in earlier versions of macOS. The app surfaces individual user guides for apps such as [[Freeform (Apple)|Freeform]], [[Pages (word processor)|Pages]], [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]], [[Notes (Apple)|Notes]], and [[Apple TV app|Apple TV]], and also surfaces user guides for any other devices a user may own, such as an [[iPhone]], [[Apple Watch]] or [[Apple TV]]. As an independent app, it can also be pinned to the Dock.\n\n== Supported hardware ==\nmacOS Sequoia supports Macs with [[Apple silicon]] and those with Intel's [[Skylake (microarchitecture)#Workstation processors|Xeon W]] and 8th-generation [[Coffee Lake]] chips or later. A Mac with an [[Apple M1|M1]] chip or later is required to use [[Apple Intelligence]]. macOS Sequoia supports every Mac that supports macOS Sonoma, with the exception of the 2018\u20132019 MacBook Air models with [[Kaby Lake#Amber Lake|Amber Lake]] chips. Similar to Sonoma, the 2019 iMac is the only supported [[Intel]] Mac that lacks a [[Apple T2|T2 security chip]]. macOS Sequoia is the first version of macOS to drop support for a Mac with a T2 security chip.\n\nThe following devices are compatible with macOS Sequoia:<ref name=\"preview\">{{Cite web |title=macOS Sequoia Preview |url=https://www.apple.com/macos/macos-sequoia-preview/ |access-date=2024-06-10 |website=Apple |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n* [[iMac]] (2019 and later)\n* [[iMac Pro]] (2017)\n* [[MacBook Air]] (2020 and later)\n* [[MacBook Pro]] (2018 and later)\n* [[Mac Mini]] (2018 and later)\n* [[Mac Pro]] (2019 and later)\n* [[Mac Studio]] (all models)\n\n=== Unofficial support ===\nBy using patch tools such as [https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/ OpenCore Legacy Patcher], macOS Sequoia can be unofficially installed on earlier models that are officially unsupported. Such models date back to the 2009 Mac Mini, 2008 MacBook Pro and 2007 iMac (after a [[Penryn (microprocessor)|Penryn]] CPU upgrade).<ref>OpenCore Legacy Patcher - https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases/1.0.0 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231005005841/https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases/1.0.0|date=October 5, 2023}}</ref>\n\n== Release history ==\nThe first developer beta of macOS Sequoia was released on June 10, 2024.
