The phone was praised on its design, but its downfall was its use of [[Android Donut|Android 1.6]] at a time when competitors were on 2.1. There was a great delay in the update of the firmware, due to the heavily skinned OS, as well as Timescape and Mediascape which needed to be reprogrammed every time an update was made. The phone also lacked pinch to zoom, but this was added later as well as HD video recording. \n\nThe [[X10 Mini]] and the [[X10 Mini Pro]] were, as the names suggest, smaller versions of the X10. These were received relatively well and proved to be very popular, as there were no other smartphones on the market at that time which were as small as the two.\n\nThe Z series smartphones continued the Xperia legacy with an omni-balance design and water resistance. On several Sony Xperia smartphones such as the [[Xperia Z]], the [[charging port]] is located at the top of the left edge, rather than popularly at the bottom center.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://de.ifixit.com/Anleitung/Sony+Xperia+Z+Charging+Port+-+Micro+USB+Replacement/102432 |website=iFixit |title=Sony Xperia Z Charging Port / Micro USB Replacement |first1=Alex |last1=Sander |date=19 January 2018 |access-date=11 February 2021 |archive-date=11 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210211214616/https://de.ifixit.com/Anleitung/Sony+Xperia+Z+Charging+Port+-+Micro+USB+Replacement/102432 |url-status=live }}</ref><!-- Should the charging port blurb be here? --> \n\nThe Xperia Z is the earliest known device to feature [[high dynamic range]] filming, and does it at 1080p.
