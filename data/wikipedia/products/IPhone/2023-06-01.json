The main hardware of the iPhone is the [[touchscreen]], with current models offering screens of 4.7 inches and larger. All iPhones include a rear-facing camera; the front-facing camera dates back to the [[iPhone 4]]. The [[iPhone 7]] Plus introduced multiple lenses to the rear-facing camera. A range of sensors are also included on the device, such as a [[proximity sensor]], [[Photodetector|ambient light sensor]], [[accelerometer]], [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic sensor]], [[magnetometer]], [[Face ID|facial recognition sensor]] or [[Touch ID|fingerprint sensor]] (depending on the model) and [[barometer]].
