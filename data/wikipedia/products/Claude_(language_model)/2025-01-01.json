Then the model is fine-tuned on these revised responses.<ref name=\"Anthropic-2023b\" />\n\nFor the reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) phase, responses are generated, and an AI compares their compliance with the constitution. This dataset of AI feedback is used to train a preference model that evaluates responses based on how much they satisfy the constitution. Claude is then fine-tuned to [[AI alignment|align]] with this preference model. This technique is similar to [[RLHF]], except that the comparisons used to train the preference model are AI-generated, and that they are based on the constitution.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Eliot |first=Lance |date=May 25, 2023 |title=Latest Generative AI Boldly Labeled As Constitutional AI Such As Claude By Anthropic Has Heart In The Right Place, Says AI Ethics And AI Law |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2023/05/25/latest-generative-ai-boldly-labeled-as-constitutional-ai-such-as-claude-by-anthropic-has-heart-in-the-right-place-says-ai-ethics-and-ai-law/ |access-date=March 27, 2024 |website=Forbes |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe \"constitution\" for Claude included 75 points, including sections from the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].<ref name=\"Bai-2022\" /><ref name=\"Time-2023\">{{Cite magazine |date=July 18, 2023 |title=What to Know About Claude 2, Anthropic's Rival to ChatGPT |url=https://time.com/6295523/claude-2-anthropic-chatgpt/ |access-date=January 23, 2024 |magazine=TIME |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Models ==\n[[File:Claude chatbot example screenshot.webp|thumb|upright=1.2|Screenshot of an example of Claude 3.5 Haiku answer describing [[Wikipedia]]]]\nThe name Claude was notably inspired by [[Claude Shannon]], a pioneer in artificial intelligence.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Roose |first=Kevin |date=July 11, 2023 |title=Inside the White-Hot Center of A.I.

Released alongside 3.5 Sonnet was the new Artifacts capability in which Claude was able to create code in a dedicated window in the interface and preview the rendered output in real time, such as SVG graphics or websites.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pierce |first=David |date=June 20, 2024 |title=Anthropic has a fast new AI model \u2014 and a clever new way to interact with chatbots |url=https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24181961/anthropic-claude-35-sonnet-model-ai-launch |access-date=June 20, 2024 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAn \"upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet\" was introduced on October 22, 2024, along with Claude 3.5 Haiku. A feature, \"computer use,\" was also unveiled in public beta. This capability enables Claude 3.5 Sonnet to interact with a computer's desktop environment, performing tasks such as moving the cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text, effectively mimicking human computer interactions. This development allows the AI to autonomously execute complex, multi-step tasks across various applications.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Introducing computer use, a new Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku |url=https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use |access-date=2024-10-25 |website=www.anthropic.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nClaude 2 received criticism for its stringent ethical alignment that may reduce usability and performance. Users have been refused assistance with benign requests, for example with the programming question \"How can I [[Kill (command)|kill]] all [[Python (programming language)|python]] processes in my [[ubuntu]] server?\" This has led to a debate over the \"alignment tax\" (the cost of ensuring an AI system is [[AI alignment|aligned]]) in AI development, with discussions centered on balancing ethical considerations and practical functionality.
