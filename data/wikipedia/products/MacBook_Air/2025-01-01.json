===\n[[File:Macbook Air 15 inch - 2 (blurred).jpg|thumb|A MacBook Air (15-inch, M2, 2023) running macOS Ventura]]\nOn June 6, 2022, during the 2022 [[Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)]], Apple announced their second-generation processor, called M2, with an improved performance versus the previous M1 processor. The first computer to receive this new chip was a radically redesigned MacBook Air.\n\nThe latest MacBook Air was redesigned away from the tapered body in 2022 to match the latest MacBook Pro models and upgraded to the [[Apple M2|M2]] processor. The new model was given a larger 13.6-inch screen and brought back [[MagSafe]], now the third iteration of Apple's magnetic laptop charger ports.\n\nThis complete redesign features a dramatically thinner, flat design, doing away with the familiar wedge shape chassis that MacBook Air was most known for having. The new MacBook Air takes on hardware design cues from the 14\" and 16\" MacBook Pro notebooks released on October 26, 2021, such as a thinner, lighter, flat chassis with 20% less volume than the previous MacBook Air. Other features include [[MagSafe]] 3, which also supports fast charging up to 50% in 30 minutes with a 67W or greater power adapter, a taller 13.6\" Liquid Retina display with 500 nits max brightness (25% brighter than the previous MacBook Air), a 1080p FaceTime Camera, a three-mic array with advanced beam-forming algorithms, a high-impedance headphone jack, four-speaker sound system with Spatial Audio, full height function keys, and a total of four finishes including Silver, Space Gray, Starlight (a silver-champagne gold color), and Midnight (a dark blue color). The Gold color has been discontinued and replaced by the Starlight color found with the introduction of the [[iPhone 13]] in 2021.\n\nOn June 5, 2023, during the 2023 [[Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)]], Apple announced the new 15-inch display size option for the M2 MacBook Air lineup, with the advanced six-speaker sound system along with the major technical features such as 1080p FaceTime camera and MagSafe charging. Ordering the 15-inch MacBook Air started on June 5, with the general availability having started on June 13.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Apple introduces the 15-inch MacBook Air |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/apple-introduces-the-15-inch-macbook-air/ |access-date=2023-06-06 |website=Apple Newsroom |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 2024, Apple announced a refreshed [[Apple M3|M3]] MacBook Air in both 13-inch and 15-inch sizes.
