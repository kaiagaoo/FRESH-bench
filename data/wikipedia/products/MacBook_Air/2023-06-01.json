The first computer to receive this new chip was a radically redesigned MacBook Air.\n\nThis complete redesign features a dramatically thinner, flat design, doing away with the familiar wedge shape chassis that MacBook Air was most known for having. The new MacBook Air takes on hardware design cues from the 14\" and 16\" MacBook Pro notebooks released on October 26, 2021, such as a thinner, lighter, flat chassis with 20% less volume than the previous MacBook Air. Other features include [[MagSafe]] 3, which also supports fast charging up to 50% in 30 minutes with a 67W or greater power adapter, a taller 13.6\" Liquid Retina display with 500 nits max brightness (25% brighter than the previous MacBook Air), a 1080p FaceTime Camera, a three-mic array with advanced beam-forming algorithms, a high-impedance headphone jack, four-speaker sound system with Spatial Audio, full height function keys, and a total of four finishes including Silver, Space Gray, Starlight (a silver-champagne color), and Midnight (a dark blue-black color). The Gold color has been discontinued and replaced by the Starlight color found with the introduction of the [[iPhone 13]] in 2021.\n\nAs of May 2023, Apple sells the MacBook Air (Flat Unibody) M2 starting at $1199 USD.\n\n== Supported operating systems ==\n=== macOS ===\n[[macOS Ventura]], the current release of macOS, will work with Wi-Fi and graphics acceleration on unsupported MacBook Air computers with a compatible patch utility.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Supported Models {{!}} OpenCore Legacy Patcher |url=https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/MODELS.html#macbook-air |access-date=2021-06-14 |website=dortania.github.io |archive-date=February 1, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220201094731/https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/MODELS.html#macbook-air |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible style=\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"16\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Supported macOS releases\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |OS release\n! colspan=\"13\" |Intel-based\n! colspan=\"2\" |Apple silicon\n|-\n! colspan=\"1\" |Early 2008\n! colspan=\"1\" |Late 2008\n! colspan=\"1\" |Mid 2009\n! colspan=\"1\" |Late 2010\n! colspan=\"1\" |Mid 2011\n! colspan=\"1\" |Mid 2012\n! colspan=\"1\" |Mid 2013\n! colspan=\"1\" |Early 2014\n! colspan=\"1\" |Early 2015\n! colspan=\"1\" |2017\n\n! colspan=\"1\" |2018\n! colspan=\"1\" |2019\n! colspan=\"1\" |2020\n! colspan=\"1\" |M1, 2020\n!M2, 2022\n|-\n!
