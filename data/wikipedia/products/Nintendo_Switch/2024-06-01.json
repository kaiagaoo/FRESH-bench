Released in the middle of the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth generation of home consoles]], the Switch succeeded the [[Wii U]] and competed with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox One]] and [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 4]]; it also competes with the [[Ninth generation of video game consoles|ninth-generation consoles]], Microsoft's [[Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X/S]] and Sony's [[PlayStation 5]]. \n\nThe Switch is a [[Tablet computer#Gaming tablet|tablet]] that can either be [[docking station|docked]] for [[home video game console|home console]] use or used as a [[handheld game console|portable device]], making it a [[Video game console#Hybrid video game consoles|hybrid console]]. Its wireless [[Joy-Con]] controllers, with standard buttons and directional [[analog stick]]s for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld-style play. They can also connect to a grip accessory to provide a traditional home console [[gamepad]] form, or be used individually in the hand like the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]], supporting local multiplayer modes. The [[Nintendo Switch system software|Switch's software]] supports [[online game|online gaming]] through internet connectivity, as well as local [[Wireless ad hoc network|wireless ad hoc]] connectivity with other consoles. Switch games and software are available on both physical [[flash storage|flash]]-based [[Nintendo game card|ROM cartridges]] and [[digital distribution of video games|digital distribution]] via [[Nintendo eShop]]; the system has no [[Regional lockout|region lockout]].{{efn|Switch units sold in China do have a regional lockout, limited to games published in China and those on the Chinese eShop.}} Two hardware revisions have been released: the handheld-only Switch Lite, released on September 20, 2019; and a higher-end version featuring an [[OLED]] screen, released on October 8, 2021.\n\nThe Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016. Known in development by its codename '''NX''', the concept came about as Nintendo's reaction to several quarters of financial losses into 2014, attributed to poor sales of the Wii U and market competition from [[mobile game]]s. Nintendo's then-president [[Satoru Iwata]] pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Switch's design was aimed at a wide demographic of players through multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on [[Nvidia]]'s [[Tegra]] line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing [[game engine]]s. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many [[Video game developer#Third-party developers|third-party developers and publishers]] to help build the Switch's game library alongside its first-party games, including many [[independent video game]] studios. While Nintendo initially anticipated around 100 games for its first year, over 320 from first-party, third-party, and independent developers were released by the end of 2017.\n\n{{As of|2024|March}}, the Nintendo Switch has shipped over 141&nbsp;million units worldwide. It is Nintendo's best-selling home console{{Efn|name=\"Home Console Note\"|Although the Switch is a hybrid game console, Nintendo refers to it as \"a home video game system that can also be used as a handheld\".<ref>{{cite web|title = Company History|access-date = September 30, 2022|url = https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/en/history/|archive-date = September 30, 2022|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220930180837/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/en/history/|url-status = live}}</ref>}} and the [[List of best-selling game consoles#Best-selling game consoles|third-best-selling game console of all time]], behind the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Nintendo DS]].

[[Nintendo of America]] president and [[Chief operating officer|COO]] [[Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9]] emphasized the console's appeal as a device that would provide gamers the option to play at home or on

establish unique and difficult-to-copy devices.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.fastcompany.com/3067343/innovation-agents/nintendo-switch | title = With Nintendo's Switch Game Console, New Ideas

concepts of the Switch extend from the \"lateral thinking with seasoned technology\" design philosophy of [[Gunpei Yokoi]] that Nintendo has used over the last couple of decades.<ref name=\"time miyamoto\" />\n\nThe commercial failure of the Wii U also pressured Nintendo in the Switch's development. Early sales of the Wii U were weak compared to the Wii, and major third-party studios like [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Ubisoft]] announced they would not support the console near the end of the Wii U's first year, further hampering its sales. According to Fils-Aim\u00e9, when it became apparent that the Wii U's life cycle performance would underperform the company's expectations, the Switch became a \"make or break product\" for Nintendo.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2021/01/30/reggie-switch-switch-wii-u/ | title = Reggie: Switch was a \"make or break product\" for Nintendo that \"luckily was a hit\" | date = January 30, 2021 | access-date = January 30, 2021 | work = [[VG247]] | archive-date = July 1, 2022 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220701033529/https://www.vg247.com/reggie-switch-switch-wii-u | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe design of the Switch was aimed to bridge the polarization of the gaming market at the time, creating a device that could play \"leisurely\" video games along with games that are aimed to be played \"deeply\", according to Shinya Takahashi and [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]], general manager and deputy general manager of Nintendo's [[Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development|Entertainment Planning & Development Division]] (EPD) respectively.<ref name=\"glixel history\" /> This approach also would apply to the cultural lifestyle and gaming differences between Japanese and Western players; Japanese players tend to play on the go and with social groups, while Western players tend to play at home by themselves.<ref name=\"time feb2017\" /> The design of the Switch would meet both cultures, and certain games, like ''[[1-2-Switch]]'', could potentially make social gaming more acceptable in Western culture.<ref name=\"time kimishima\" /> Two key elements that were set to address this mixed market were the ability for the unit to play either on a television screen or as a portable and the use of detachable controllers.<ref name=\"glixel history\" /> The \"Switch\" name was selected not only to refer to the console's ability to switch from handheld to home console modes, but to present \"the idea of being a 'switch' that will flip and change the way people experience entertainment in their daily lives\".<ref name=\"siliconera naming\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.siliconera.com/2016/12/07/nintendo-explains-switch-got-name-goal-reveal-trailer/ | title = Nintendo Explains How The Switch Got Its Name And What Their Goal Was With Its Reveal Trailer | author = Casey | date = December 7, 2016 | access-date = December 7, 2016 | website = [[Siliconera]] | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161208125224/http://www.siliconera.com/2016/12/07/nintendo-explains-switch-got-name-goal-reveal-trailer/ | archive-date = December 8, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nPart of the inspiration of the Switch's form and design was from feedback players had given Nintendo on the [[Wii Remote]], according to Shinya Takahashi. With the release of games like ''[[Wii Sports]]'' and ''[[Wii Fit]]'', players had asked Nintendo if they could make the Wii Remote in a smaller form factor, potentially strapped to a part of their body. This led to Nintendo envisioning what a smaller form-factor controller could provide in both hardware and gameplay, and it led to the idea of a console that was small enough with these new controllers to also be portable.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/the-nintendo-switch-joy-cons-and-even-labo-are-the-result-of-wii-era-feedback |title=The Nintendo Switch, Joy-Cons, and even Labo are the result of Wii-era feedback |first=Alissa |last=McAloon |date=February 9, 2018 |access-date=February 9, 2018 |website=[[Game Developer (website)|Game Developer]] |archive-date=August 27, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210827162952/https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/the-nintendo-switch-joy-cons-and-even-labo-are-the-result-of-wii-era-feedback |url-status=live }}</ref> Other concepts came out of critical consumer feedback of the Wii U. Fils-Aim\u00e9 said that one common criticism they had for the Wii U was that while players did enjoy using the [[Wii U GamePad]] and would want to play games on it anywhere, it became functionless if they moved a distance away from the main console. This served for Nintendo to design a home console that the player could take with them anywhere.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/nintendo-president-our-future-is-as-an-entertainment-company/ | title = Nintendo president: \"I compete for time,\" not against Xbox, PlayStation | first = Sam | last = Mackovech | date = October 3, 2018 | access-date = October 8, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] | archive-date = November 9, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201109042247/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/nintendo-president-our-future-is-as-an-entertainment-company/ | url-status = live }}</ref> Around five different prototypes were developed for the Switch before they finalized on the released design. This included developing different methods of how the Joy-Con controllers would physically connect to the console, including using magnets to hold them in place.<ref name=\"glixel history\" />\n\nIn addition to the form-factor design, Nintendo needed to balance the power and speed of the console's [[central processing unit]] with battery life and the unit's size, coupled with limited development resources and deadlines set by Nintendo's management. One choice made by the development team was to use an existing [[system on a chip]] (SOC) rather than creating their own as they had done on previous consoles. Koizumi said that this break from tradition was done to gain more third-party support for the console by using an SOC to which developers could easily port games. Nintendo was not focused on raw processing power but was instead looking to balance the overall features of the system, including battery life and size, as well as keeping in mind their limited development resources and timeline. Koizumi said, \"The most difficult part was on how to take an overall balance while we were getting entangled with all of those in complexity.\"<ref name=\"glixel history\" /> To achieve this balance, they did not opt to use the more powerful hardware they could have used, instead using a middle-ground approach to achieve their vision of the Switch.<ref>{{Cite magazine | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/28/the-switchs-architect-on-why-nintendos-consoles-are-different.aspx | title = The Switch's Architect On Why Nintendo's Consoles Are Different | first = Ben | last = Reeves | date = February 26, 2017 | access-date = March 1, 2017 | magazine = [[Game Informer]] | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170301082232/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/28/the-switchs-architect-on-why-nintendos-consoles-are-different.aspx | archive-date = March 1, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nKoizumi served as the general producer of the Switch during its development.<ref name=\"time feb2017\" /> According to Miyamoto, the Switch's development within Nintendo was headed by younger employees, with him saying \"it's really been them that have put this forward and designed this system\".<ref name=\"glixel miyamoto\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.glixel.com/news/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-didnt-lead-switch-development-w460944 | title = Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto Didn't Lead Switch Development | first = John | last = Davidson | date = January 12, 2017 | access-date = January 12, 2017 | website = [[Glixel]] | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170113170747/http://www.glixel.com/news/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-didnt-lead-switch-development-w460944 | archive-date = January 13, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes dec 2017\" /> Miyamoto said of the younger employees: \"I always look for designers who aren't super-passionate game fans.

{{convert|5.5|in|cm}} diagonally. Additionally, a regular [[directional pad]] replaces the four directional buttons on the integrated left Joy-Con. While using a smaller battery than the original Switch, the Switch Lite uses a more power-efficient chipset, the 16-nanometer Tegra X1+, to extend the estimated use time from 2.5 to 6.5 hours to 3\u20137 hours on a single battery charge.<ref name=\"theverge fcc lite\">{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/5/20755253/nintendo-switch-lite-smaller-battery-new-processor-fcc-filings | title = Nintendo Switch Lite FCC filings confirm a smaller battery, new processor, and Odin fixation | first = Cameron | last = Faulkner | date = August 5, 2019 | access-date = August 5, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] | archive-date = August 5, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190805222523/https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/5/20755253/nintendo-switch-lite-smaller-battery-new-processor-fcc-filings | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Nintendo's goal with the Switch Lite was to produce a sub {{USD|200}} unit, aimed at [[Gamer#Dedication spectrum|casual gamers]], to compete with gaming services that do not require a dedicated device. To achieve this, Nintendo negotiated on reduced prices from its component suppliers. Further, the ''Journal'' stated that Nintendo had gained [[Murata Manufacturing]] as a battery supplier in addition to [[TDK]], to lower costs by causing competition between the two companies.<ref name=\"wsj lite\">{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendo-seeks-to-sustain-switch-sales-with-stripped-down-console-11568975330 | title = Nintendo Seeks to Sustain Switch Sales With Stripped-Down Console | first = Takashi | last = Mochizuki | date = September 20, 2019 | access-date = September 20, 2019 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | archive-date = September 21, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190921214420/https://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendo-seeks-to-sustain-switch-sales-with-stripped-down-console-11568975330 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe Switch Lite normally only supports games that can be played in handheld mode, retaining features like the Switch's [[Accelerometer#Consumer electronics|gyroscopic sensors]], Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and [[Near-field communication|NFC]] compatibility.

of Nintendo Switch is more promising\" and spur further game development for the platform.<ref name=\"gibiz wii\" /> Kimishima said that a key goal in their production ramp up would be to make sure they have enough Switch inventory near the end of 2017 for holiday sales, as to avoid the issue with Wii shortages that occurred during its first holiday-season period, while balancing the near-term high demand.<ref name=\"gamasutra fy2016 qa\" /> According to Kimishima, Nintendo now believed that if they could reach 10&nbsp;million in Switch sales in 2017, they expected the Switch would have
