Unlike conventional approaches, Dynamic Caching ensures that only the precise amount of memory required for a task is used, thereby optimizing memory usage and potentially enhancing performance and efficiency. This is particularly beneficial for graphics-intensive tasks, where dynamic memory allocation can be critical.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Roston |first=Brittany |date=2023-10-31 |title=Apple Reveals 3nm M3 Chipset Family, With Pro And Max Available Right Out Of The Gate |url=https://www.slashgear.com/1434289/apple-m3-pro-max-cpus-3nm/ |access-date=2023-10-31 |website=SlashGear |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Memory ===\n\nThe M3's [[Unified Memory Architecture]]<!-- this link currently redirects to \"integrated graphics\", so this can be considered a placeholder for more detailed discussion --> is similar to the M2 generation; each M3 SoCs use 6,400 [[Transfer (computing)|MT/s]] [[LPDDR#LPDDR5 |LPDDR5 SDRAM]].  As with prior M series SoCs, this serves as both RAM and video RAM. The M3 has 8 controllers, the M3 Pro has 12 controllers and the M3 Max has 32 controllers. Each controller is 16-bits wide and is capable of accessing up to 4 GiB RAM.<ref name=\"anand\" />\n\nThe M3 Pro and 14-core M3 Max have lower memory bandwidth than the M1/M2 Pro and M1/M2 Max respectively.  The M3 Pro has a 192-bit memory bus where the M1 and M2 Pro had a 256-bit bus, resulting in only 150&nbsp;GB/sec bandwidth versus 200&nbsp;GB/sec for its predecessors.  The 14-core M3 Max only enables 24 out of the 32 controllers, therefore it has 300&nbsp;GB/sec vs. the 400&nbsp;GB/sec for all models of the M1 and M2 Max, while the 16-core M3 Max has the same 400&nbsp;GB/sec as the prior M1 and M2 Max models.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/apple-m3-pro-less-memory-bandwidth/ |title= Apple M3 Pro Chip Has 25% Less Memory Bandwidth Than M1/M2 Pro|author=Tim Hardwick|date=October 31, 2023| work =Mac Rumors}}</ref>\n\n=== Other features ===\nThe M3 contains dedicated [[AI accelerator|neural network hardware]] in a 16-core Neural Engine capable of executing 15.8 trillion operations per second.
