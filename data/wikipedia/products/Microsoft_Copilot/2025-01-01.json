Starting in 2024, this key replaces the [[menu key]] for licensed Windows-compatible keyboards.]]\n'''Microsoft Copilot''' is a [[generative artificial intelligence]] [[chatbot]] developed by [[Microsoft]]. Based on the [[GPT-4]] series of [[large language model]]s, it was launched in 2023 as Microsoft's primary replacement for the discontinued [[Cortana (virtual assistant)|Cortana]].\n\nThe service was introduced in February 2023 under the name ''Bing Chat'', as a built-in feature for [[Microsoft Bing]] and [[Microsoft Edge]]. Over the course of 2023, Microsoft began to unify the ''Copilot'' branding across its various chatbot products, cementing the \"[[copilot]]\" analogy. At its [[Microsoft Build#2023|Build 2023]] conference, Microsoft announced its plans to integrate Copilot into [[Windows 11]], allowing users to access it directly through the taskbar. In January 2024, a dedicated Copilot key was announced for Windows keyboards.\n\nCopilot utilizes the Microsoft Prometheus model, built upon [[OpenAI]]'s [[GPT-4]] foundational large language model, which in turn has been fine-tuned using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. Copilot's conversational interface style resembles that of [[ChatGPT]]. The chatbot is able to cite sources, create poems, generate songs, and use numerous languages and dialects.\n\nMicrosoft operates Copilot on a [[Freemium|freemium model]]. Users on its free tier can access most features, while priority access to newer features, including custom chatbot creation, is provided to paid subscribers under the \"Microsoft Copilot Pro\" paid subscription service. Several default chatbots are available in the free version of Microsoft Copilot, including the standard Copilot chatbot as well as Microsoft Designer, which is oriented towards using its Image Creator to [[Text-to-image model|generate images based on text prompts]].\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2019, Microsoft partnered with [[OpenAI]] and began investing billions of dollars into the organization.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 22, 2019 |title=Microsoft invests in and partners with OpenAI |url=https://openai.com/blog/microsoft-invests-in-and-partners-with-openai |language=en |access-date=March 17, 2023 |archive-date=February 28, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230228125554/https://openai.com/blog/microsoft-invests-in-and-partners-with-openai |url-status=live }}</ref> Since then, OpenAI systems have run on an [[Microsoft Azure|Azure]]-based [[supercomputer|supercomputing]] platform from Microsoft.<ref name=\"Langston 2023\">{{cite web | last=Langston | first=Jennifer | title=Microsoft announces new supercomputer, lays out vision for future AI work | website=Source | date=January 11, 2023 | quote=Built in collaboration with and exclusively for OpenAI | url=https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210180449/https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/ | archive-date=February 10, 2023 | url-status=live | access-date=February 10, 2023 }}</ref><ref name=\"Foley 2020\">{{cite web | last=Foley | first=Mary Jo | title=Microsoft builds a supercomputer for OpenAI for training massive AI models | website=ZDNET | date=May 19, 2020 | quote= | url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-builds-a-supercomputer-for-openai-for-training-massive-ai-models/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210180846/https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-builds-a-supercomputer-for-openai-for-training-massive-ai-models/ | archive-date=February 10, 2023 | url-status=live | access-date=February 10, 2023 }}</ref><ref name=\"Engadget 2020\">{{cite web | title=Microsoft's OpenAI supercomputer has 285,000 CPU cores, 10,000 GPUs | quote=Microsoft's OpenAI supercomputer has 285,000 CPU cores, 10,000 GPUs.
