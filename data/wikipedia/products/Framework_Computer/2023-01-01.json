The laptop has four expansion slots that can each accept one of seven expansion cards. These consist of USB-C, USB-A, DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0b, 256GB storage expansion, 1TB storage expansion, and MicroSD.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fix Consumer Electronics |url=https://frame.work/marketplace/expansion-cards |access-date=2022-08-30 |website=Framework |language=en}}</ref> A 2.5GbE Ethernet expansion card is currently under development. In addition, each expansion slot has a recessed USB-C port, which can both be used to connect expansion cards, or as a standard USB-C port, though connecting a USB-C expansion card allows for easier access to the port. The company launched the Expansion Card Developer Program to open card development, released documentation, [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] templates, and reference designs for Expansion Cards, all under open source licenses to make it easy for both hardware companies and individual makers to create new card designs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/ExpansionCards|title=Reference designs and documentation to create Expansion Cards for the Framework Laptop|via=github.com|author=Framework Computer}}</ref>\n\n==== Firmware ====\n\nThe laptop uses a proprietary [[BIOS]] firmware, InsydeH2O [[UEFI]] [[BIOS]] by [[Insyde Software]]<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 9, 2021|url=https://www.insyde.com/press_news/press-releases/insyde%C2%AE-software-powers-newly-launched-framework%E2%84%A2-modular-laptop|title=Insyde\u00ae Software Powers Newly Launched Framework\u2122 Modular Laptop|website=Insyde Software}}</ref> and an open sourced [[embedded controller]] (EC) firmware based on CrOS EC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/HEAD/README.md|title=CrOS EC (Embedded Controller)|website=chromium.googlesource.com}}</ref> by Framework.

The Marketplace also sells customization parts, including different colors of screen bezels, different keyboard layouts, and additional expansion cards.
