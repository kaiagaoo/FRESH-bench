[[Microsoft]]. Released on November 10, 2020, the higher-end Xbox Series X and lower-end Xbox Series S are part of the [[ninth generation of video game consoles]], which also includes [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 5]], released the same month.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rogers|first=Carter|title=Playstation 5, Xbox Series X Bring Sony-Microsoft Rivalry To A New Generation|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/12/933951775/playstation-5-xbox-series-x-bring-sony-microsoft-rivalry-to-a-new-generation|access-date=2020-11-13|website=NPR.org|language=en|archive-date=November 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113014820/https://www.npr.org/2020/11/12/933951775/playstation-5-xbox-series-x-bring-sony-microsoft-rivalry-to-a-new-generation|url-status=live}}</ref> They superseded the [[Xbox One]].\n\nIn early 2019, rumors emerged of a fourth generation of Xbox consoles (codenamed \"Scarlett\") that consisted of a high-end model (\"Anaconda\") and a lower-end model (\"Lockhart\"). Microsoft teased Anaconda in June 2019 during [[E3 2019]] and unveiled it as the Xbox Series X during [[The Game Awards 2019|The Game Awards]] in December. On September 8, 2020, Microsoft unveiled the Xbox Series S.\n\nLike the Xbox One, the consoles use an [[AMD]] 64-bit [[x86-64]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. Both models have [[solid-state drive]]s to reduce loading times, support for hardware-accelerated [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray-tracing]] and [[spatial audio]], the ability to convert games to [[high-dynamic-range rendering]] using [[machine learning]] (Auto HDR), support for [[HDMI 2.1]] [[variable refresh rate]] and low-latency modes, and updated [[Xbox Wireless Controller|controllers]]. Xbox Series X was designed to nominally render games in 2160p ([[4K resolution]]) at 60 [[frames per second]] (FPS). The lower-end, digital-only Xbox Series S, which has reduced specifications and does not include an optical drive, was designed to nominally render games in [[1440p]] at 60 FPS, with support for 4K [[video scaling]] and ray tracing.<ref name=\"wincentral series s\" />\n\nXbox Series X/S are [[backwards-compatible]] with nearly all Xbox One-compatible games and accessories (including [[Xbox 360]] and [[original Xbox]] games that were [[List of backward-compatible games for Xbox One and Series X/S|made backward-compatible with Xbox One]]);  the newer hardware gives games better performance and visuals. At launch, Microsoft encouraged a \"soft\" transition between generations, similar to [[PC gaming]], offering the \"Smart Delivery\" framework to allow publishers to provide upgraded versions of Xbox One titles with optimizations for Xbox Series X/S. Publishers are not required to use Smart Delivery and may publish Xbox Series X/S-exclusive titles if they choose. [[Electronic Arts]] is among the developers that do not use Smart Delivery.\n\nCritics praised the Xbox Series X/S for the hardware improvements over Xbox One and Microsoft's emphasis on cross-generation releases, but believed that the games available at launch did not fully use the hardware capabilities. Microsoft has not released sales data for the Xbox Series X/S but said on July 27, 2021, that they were the fastest-selling Xbox models to date. It was estimated that Microsoft had shipped at least 18.5 million units of the two consoles worldwide by December 2022.<ref name=\"Sales\">{{cite web |title=Xbox Series X/S has sold 18.5 million

Because of this, at launch, many did not feel these consoles truly represented the next generation of home consoles. The lack of significant launch-day exclusive titles designed to show off the new hardware capabilities, as well as the familiar controller shape and user interface, was considered by some to be disappointing given the next-generation focus of Sony's PlayStation 5. The Series X was generally considered the better unit when compared to the Series S, as the computation and space limitations of the latter made it a less user-friendly experience to navigate but still otherwise functional.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-series-x-s-review-round-up-critics-praise-hardware-but-bemoan-lack-of-exclusives/ | title = Xbox Series X/S review round-up: Critics praise hardware, but bemoan lack of exclusives | first = Tom | last = Ivan | date = November 5, 2020 | access-date = November 5, 2020 | work = [[Video Games Chronicle]] | archive-date = November 5, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201105171729/https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-series-x-s-review-round-up-critics-praise-hardware-but-bemoan-lack-of-exclusives/ | url-status = live }}</ref> ''[[Eurogamer]]''<nowiki/>'s Richard Leadbetter stated \"I love the hardware in terms of what I can potentially experience with it and the expert implementation of many of its forward-looking features\u2014but a console is defined by its games, and in that sense, I still feel that I barely know the machine at all.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-xbox-series-x-console-review | title = Xbox Series X review: next generation games machine, continuity console \u2013 or both? | first = Richard | last = Leadbetter | date = November 5, 2020 | access-date = November 5, 2020 | work = [[Eurogamer]] | archive-date = November 5, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201105140037/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-xbox-series-x-console-review | url-status = live }}</ref> Keza MacDonald of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that while there is no immediate driving force to buy the consoles at launch, \"there's not much to criticise: they do everything they promised to do, and they do it well.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/nov/05/xbox-series-x-s-review-game-gaming | title = Xbox Series X and Series S review: no-nonsense, next-generation gaming | first = Keza | last = MacDonald | date = November 5, 2020 | access-date = November 5, 2020 | work = [[The Guardian]] | archive-date = November 5, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201105140225/https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/nov/05/xbox-series-x-s-review-game-gaming | url-status = live }}</ref> ''[[Gamasutra]]''{{'s}} Kris Graft and Chris Kerr said that \"Microsoft has delivered two highly appealing entry points that can turn players into long-term customers, while at the same time erasing the idea of 'generations,' exposing people to more games, past, present and future.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/373176/A_tale_of_two_consoles_Xbox_Series_X_and_S_in_review.php | title = A tale of two consoles: Xbox Series X and S in review | first1 = Kris | last1 = Graft | first2 = Chris | last2 = Kerr | date = November 5, 2020 | access-date = November 5, 2020 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-date = November 5, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201105140258/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/373176/A_tale_of_two_consoles_Xbox_Series_X_and_S_in_review.php | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2021, Jordan Ram\u00e9e of ''GameSpot'' acknowledged that Xbox Series X and S had begun to see higher-profile console-exclusive releases since their launch (such as ''[[Forza Horizon 5]]'', ''[[Psychonauts 2]],'' and the third-party titles ''[[The Artful Escape]]'' and ''[[The Big Con]]''), and that Smart Delivery was a \"crucial\" feature of the consoles\u2014praising the system for being seamless and automatic unlike PlayStation 5, whose user interface \"did not make it abundantly clear which version of a game you were choosing to download and play, occasionally resulting in players accidentally putting the PS4 version of a game on their PS5.\" He also felt that migrating from an older Xbox One was easier than migrating from PS4 to PS5, citing Smart Delivery, automatic synchronization of save data, and maintaining the same user interface.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Xbox Series X{{!}}S \u2013 What Surprised Us Most, 1 Year Later |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-what-surprised-us-most-1-year-later/1100-6497983/ |access-date=2022-08-15 |website=GameSpot |language=en-US |archive-date=August 15, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220815195432/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-what-surprised-us-most-1-year-later/1100-6497983/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Sales ===\nMicrosoft announced that the Xbox Series X/S was the biggest Xbox console launch, with more consoles sold in more countries in its first 24 hours than any previous Xbox.
