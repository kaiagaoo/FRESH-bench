It is currently sold with 14-inch and 16-inch screens, all using [[Apple_silicon#M_series|Apple silicon M-series chips]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe original MacBook Pro used a similar design to the [[PowerBook G4]], but replaced the [[PowerPC G4]] chips with [[Intel Core]] processors, added a [[webcam]], and introduced the [[MagSafe]] power connector. The 15-inch model was introduced in January 2006; the 17-inch model in April. Later revisions added [[Intel Core 2]] Duo processors and [[LED-backlit LCD|LED-backlit displays]].\n\nThe unibody 15-inch model debuted in October 2008, with a 17-inch variant added in January 2009. In June of the same year, a 13-inch variant was added to the MacBook Pro lineup. Called the \"unibody\" model because its case was machined from a single piece of aluminum, it had a thinner flush display, a redesigned trackpad whose entire surface consisted of a single clickable button, and a redesigned keyboard. Updates brought [[List of Intel Core i5 processors|Intel Core i5]] and [[List of Intel Core i7 processors|i7]] processors and introduced Intel's [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]].\n\nThe Retina MacBook Pro was released in 2012: the 15-inch in June and a 13-inch model in October. It is thinner than its predecessor, made [[Solid-state drive|solid-state storage (SSD)]] standard, added [[HDMI]], and included a high-resolution [[Retina display]]. It eliminated [[Ethernet]], [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]] ports and the optical drive.\n\nThe Touch Bar MacBook Pro, released in October 2016, adopted [[USB-C]] for all data ports and power and included a shallower \"butterfly\"-mechanism keyboard. On all but the base model, the function keys were replaced with a touchscreen strip called the Touch Bar with a [[Touch ID]] sensor integrated into the power button.\n\nA November 2019 revision to the Touch Bar MacBook Pro introduced the Magic Keyboard, which uses a scissor-switch mechanism. The initial 16-inch model with a screen set in narrower bezels was followed by a 13-inch model in May 2020. This revision also modified the Touch Bar, as users were complaining about the ESC key disappearing and not being able to exit a computer window.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Phil Schiller Discusses 16-Inch MacBook Pro, Says Virtual Esc Key Was Number One Complaint About Touch Bar |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/13/phil-schiller-16-inch-macbook-pro-interview/ |access-date=2023-02-01 |website=MacRumors Forums |date=November 13, 2019 |language=en-US |archive-date=February 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230201212012/https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/13/phil-schiller-16-inch-macbook-pro-interview/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Therefore, it was put as a whole button as it was standard before Touch Bar Macs.\n\nAnother revision to the Touch Bar MacBook Pro was released in November 2020; it was the first MacBook Pro to feature an [[Apple silicon|Apple-designed system on a chip]], the [[Apple M1]]. In 2022, the Touch Bar MacBook Pro was updated to feature an [[Apple M2]] chip.\n\nThe 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros were released in October 2021. Powered by either [[Apple M1|M1 Pro or M1 Max chips]], they are the first to be available only with an [[Apple silicon]] system on a chip. These models re-introduced MagSafe, function keys, and some other elements that had been removed from the Touch Bar MacBook Pro.\n\nAlongside the [[MacBook Air#M2|redesigned M2 MacBook Air]], Apple refreshed the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros powered by either the [[Apple M2|M2 Pro or M2 Max chip]] in January of 2023. Later that year, in November 2023, Apple refreshed the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros with the [[Apple M3|M3 Pro and M3 Max chips]]. Apple also released a base model 14-inch Macbook Pro powered by the [[Apple M3]] chip to replace the discontinued base model 13-inch Touch Bar MacBook Pro.\n\n== Intel-based ==\n{{main|MacBook Pro (Intel-based)}}\n\n{{Anchor|First generation (Aluminum)}}\n=== Aluminum (2006\u20132008) ===\n\n{{multiple image\n | image1 = MacBook Pro.png\n | alt1 = The MacBook Pro 15\" in 2006\n | image2 = MacBook Pro 17.jpg\n | alt2 = First-generation 17-inch MacBook Pro\n | footer = The 15-inch and 17-inch Aluminum MacBook Pros\n}}\n\nThe original MacBook Pro used the design of the [[PowerBook G4]], but replaced the [[PowerPC G4]] chips with [[Intel Core]] processors,<ref name=\"early2006macworld\">{{cite web | last = Snell | first = Jason | date = February 25, 2006 | url = https://www.macworld.com/article/49555/2006/02/mbpromain.html | title = MacBook Pro/1.83{{nbsp}}GHz and 2.0{{nbsp}}GHz | work = [[MacWorld]] | access-date = April 18, 2010 | archive-date = April 3, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100403220351/http://www.macworld.com/article/49555/2006/02/mbpromain.html | url-status = live }}</ref>  added a built-in [[iSight]] camera, and introduced the [[MagSafe (Mac)|MagSafe]] power connector.
