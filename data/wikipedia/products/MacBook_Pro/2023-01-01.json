It is currently sold with 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch screens, all using variants of the [[Apple silicon|Apple-designed]] [[Apple M1|M1]] and [[Apple M2|M2]] [[System on a chip|system on a chip]].\n\nThe first-generation MacBook Pro used the design of the [[PowerBook G4]], but replaced the [[PowerPC G4]] chips with [[Intel Core]] [[central processing unit|processors]], added a [[webcam]], and introduced the [[MagSafe (Mac)|MagSafe]] power connector. The 15-inch model was introduced in January 2006; the 17-inch model in April. Later revisions added [[Intel Core 2]] Duo processors and [[LED-backlit LCD|LED-backlit displays]].\n\nThe second-generation model debuted in October 2008 in 13- and 15-inch variants, with a 17-inch variant added in January 2009. Called the \"unibody\" model because its case was machined from a single piece of aluminum, it had a thinner flush display, a redesigned trackpad whose entire surface consisted of a single clickable button, and a redesigned keyboard. Updates brought [[Intel Core i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] processors and introduced Intel's [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]].\n\nThe third-generation MacBook Pro was released in 2012: the 15-inch in June, a 13-inch model in October. It is thinner than its predecessor, made [[Solid-state drive|solid-state storage (SSD)]] standard, added [[HDMI]], and included a high-resolution [[Retina display]]. It eliminated [[Ethernet]] and [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]] ports and the optical drive.\n\nThe fourth-generation MacBook Pro, released in October 2016, adopted [[USB-C]] for all data ports and power and included a shallower \"butterfly\"-mechanism keyboard. On all but the base model, the function keys were replaced with a touchscreen strip called the Touch Bar with a [[Touch ID]] sensor integrated into the power button.\n\nA November 2019 revision to the fourth-generation<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|title=Apple Design Resources|url=https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/|access-date=2022-01-04|website=Apple Developer|language=en-US|archive-date=January 4, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220104000528/https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/|url-status=live}}</ref> MacBook Pro<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sandoval|first=Alex|date=September 4, 2020|title=Apple MacBook Pro 13 Review: Apple Delivers a Consistently Excellent Ultraportable Laptop|url=https://www.emchat.net/emchat/2020/9/4/apple-macbook-pro-13-review-apple-delivers-a-consistently-excellent-laptop|access-date=2020-12-20|website=E-Money Chat|language=en-US|archive-date=June 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602220348/https://www.emchat.net/emchat/2020/9/4/apple-macbook-pro-13-review-apple-delivers-a-consistently-excellent-laptop|url-status=live}}</ref> introduced the Magic Keyboard, which uses a scissor-switch mechanism. The initial 16-inch model with a screen set in narrower bezels was followed by a 13-inch model in May 2020.\n\nAnother revision to the fourth generation was released in November 2020; it was the first MacBook Pro to feature an [[Apple silicon|Apple-designed system on a chip]], the [[Apple M1]].\n\nThe fifth-generation<ref name=\":11\" /> MacBook Pro was released in October 2021 in 14- and 16-inch sizes. Powered by either [[Apple M1|M1 Pro or M1 Max chips]], they are the first to be available only with an [[Apple silicon]] system on a chip. This generation re-introduced MagSafe, function keys, and some other elements that had been removed from previous models.\n\nAlongside the [[MacBook_Air#Fourth_generation_(Flat_Unibody)|redesigned fourth-generation MacBook Air]], Apple rereleased the fourth-generation MacBook Pro to include the [[Apple M2 |Apple M2 chip]]. The model features the same chassis, albeit with changes to the system audio: speakers compatible with Spatial Audio and a headphone jack with support for [[High impedance|high-impedance]] headphones.\n\n== Intel-based ==\n{{main|MacBook Pro (Intel-based)}}\n\n=== First generation (Aluminum) ===\n{{multiple image\n | image1 = MacBook Pro.png\n | alt1 = The MacBook Pro 15\" in 2006\n | image2 = MacBook Pro 17.jpg\n | alt2 = First-generation 17-inch MacBook Pro\n | footer = The 15-inch and 17-inch Aluminum MacBook Pros\n}}\n\nThe first-generation MacBook Pro used the design of the [[PowerBook G4]], but replaced the [[PowerPC G4]] chips with [[Intel Core]] [[central processing unit|processors]],<ref name=\"early2006macworld\">{{cite web | last = Snell | first = Jason | date = February 25, 2006 | url = https://www.macworld.com/article/49555/2006/02/mbpromain.html | title = MacBook Pro/1.83{{nbsp}}GHz and 2.0{{nbsp}}GHz | work = [[MacWorld]] | access-date = April 18, 2010 | archive-date = April 3, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100403220351/http://www.macworld.com/article/49555/2006/02/mbpromain.html | url-status = live }}</ref>  added a built-in [[iSight]] [[webcam]], and introduced the [[MagSafe (Mac)|MagSafe]] power connector.
