[[Nilay Patel]] of ''The Verge'' praised the headset's design as being more premium and less \"goofy\"-looking than other existing VR headsets, felt that its displays were \"generally incredible\" in their sharpness and brightness, it had the highest-quality video passthrough he had seen on an MR headset yet (even while having a [[field of view]] narrower than the Meta Quest 3), and that its speakers had a \"convincing\" [[spatial audio]] effect. However, he felt that there was \"so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn't\", citing examples such as the passthrough cameras (which \"cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays\"), eye and hand tracking that was \"inconsistent\" and \"frustrating\" to use (with parts of the visionOS interface demanding precision that couldn't be met by the eye tracking system), visionOS lacking a window management tool similar to [[Expose (Mac OS X)|Expose]] or Stage Manager, and that the personas and EyeSight features were uncanny (with the latter's visibility hampered by a dim, low resolution display covered by reflective glass). Patel felt that Apple Vision Pro was meant to be a [[development kit]] for future AR glasses, as the device's current form was\u2014from technological and philosophical standpoints\u2014too limiting for Apple's ambitions, and \"may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Patel |first=Nilay |date=2024-01-30 |title=Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it's not |url=https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240201231349/https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price |archive-date=February 1, 2024 |access-date=2024-02-01 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref>\n\nJoanna Stern of ''The Wall Street Journal'' echoed this sentiment, arguing that it was \"the best mixed-reality headset I've ever tried\", and \"so much of what the Vision Pro can do feels [[Science fiction|sci-fi]]\", but that \"these companies know these aren't really the devices we want.
