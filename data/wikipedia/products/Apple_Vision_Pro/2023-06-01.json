While virtual reality is completely immersive, in which the user only sees computer-generated imagery, augmented reality adds computer-generated imagery in the context of the user's real physical surroundings. Mixed reality headsets, such as Microsoft's [[HoloLens 2]], combine both.<ref name=teases>{{Cite web |last1=McMillan |first1=Malcolm |title=Tim Cook teases Apple VR/AR headset strategy in new interview |work=Tom's Guide |date=2022-06-22 |url=https://www.tomsguide.com/news/tim-cook-teases-apple-vrar-headset-strategy-in-new-interview |language=en |access-date=2023-03-31 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has been developing augmented reality headsets since at least 2016, when CEO [[Tim Cook]] announced to investors large investments in the technology.{{r|nextbig}} Chief designer [[Jony Ive]] presented a concept video to company executives at a corporate retreat in 2018. The company historically did not launch emerging technologies but tended to enter and change markets proven to exist. This development period saw changes in design leadership, with Ive leaving in 2019 and his successor, Evans Hankey, leaving in early 2023.{{r|NYT}} Skeptical members of the augmented reality development project left the project with doubts of its potential and social effects.{{r|NYT|nextbig}} Others were fired for slow progress.

This headset would be supported by a hip pack battery and a \"reality dial\" to control the degree of the wearer's real-world shown on the display.

The company also planned for creative applications, such as letting creators draw images in freehand, with the headset tracking their hand gestures.{{r|NYT}} Apple additionally commissioned director [[Jon Favreau]] to create custom entertainment to be experienced on the headset.<ref name=nextbig>{{Cite news |last1=Mickle |first1=Tripp |last2=Chen |first2=Brian X. |title=Apple Starts Connecting the Dots for Its Next Big Thing |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2022-06-04 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/04/business/apple-virtual-reality-headset.html |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Other planned capabilities involve fitness, gaming, sports, books, and compatibility with most iPad apps,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gurman |first1=Mark |title=Apple's AR/VR Headset to Feature Sports, Gaming, iPad Apps and Workouts |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-18/apple-vr-ar-headset-apps-sports-tv-fitness-gaming-wellness-ipad-features |website=Bloomberg |access-date=9 May 2023 |language=en |date=18 April 2023}}</ref> a \"scattershot\" approach meant to hedge uncertainty about the device's [[killer app]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gurman |first1=Mark |title=Apple Will Take Scattershot Approach to Pitching AR/VR Headset |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-23/apple-s-ar-vr-headset-plans-ipad-apps-fitness-sports-viewing-gaming-music-lgtgopgx |website=Bloomberg |access-date=9 May 2023 |language=en |date=23 April 2023}}</ref> The company developed prescription lenses to use with the mixed reality headset, as the user cannot fit glasses under the headset.{{r|NYT}} Apple planned to set the device's entry point high, appealing to a business market rather than the general consumer,{{r|NYT}} and to ship far fewer initial devices than their prior product debuts: 1 million headsets (10 percent of the VR market), as opposed to 19 million first-generation [[Apple Watch]]es.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Patrick |last2=Bradshaw |first2=Tim |title=Tim Cook bets on Apple\u2019s mixed-reality headset to secure his legacy |url=https://www.ft.com/content/86b99549-0648-4c23-ab6e-642a4ba51dff |website=Financial Times |access-date=9 May 2023 |date=12 March 2023}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Apple hardware}}\n\n[[Category:Apple Inc. products]]\n[[Category:Augmented reality]]\n[[Category:Mixed reality]]\n[[Category:Virtual reality headsets]]"}
