They are no longer constrained to the [[Notification Center]]\u2014instead they can be placed anywhere on the desktop, and the widget picker has been redesigned to resemble the [[iOS]] and [[iPadOS]] versions of it.\n* The lock screen has been redesigned to include a date and time similar to iOS and iPadOS. The power buttons have become a context menu.\n* [[Videotelephony|Video-conferencing]] apps can overlay the presenter's [[webcam]] video on top of screen sharing.\n* App icons have been made more rounded.\n* The Spotlight search bar has been made more rounded, and its width has been decreased.\n* [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] changes:\n** Browsing profiles enable separate sets of [[Bookmark (digital)|bookmark]]s, [[Browser extension|extensions]], and [[HTTP cookie|cookies]], which can be used to separate, for example, a personal setup from a work one.\n** Password sharing lets multiple people have access to the same collection of website passwords, and update them as needed, with changes syncing across all enrolled devices.\n** Safari web apps let the user add any website to the [[Dock (macOS)|Dock]] and open it in a simplified Safari interface, just like an app. A similar feature is available in Google Chrome. This feature is somewhat different from [[progressive web app]]s since it does not require additional work from website developers.\n* [[Messages (Apple)|Messages]] changes:\n** More precise search filters: for example, the contact name can be combined with a search term to look for the term within a specific conversation.\n** Catch-up lets the user quickly jump to the first unread message in a conversation.\n** Tapback now appears as multiple icons instead of being a context menu.\n** [[iMessage]] [[Sticker (messaging)|sticker]]s have a new selection interface.\n*[[Apple TV app|Apple TV]] now has a sidebar instead of a top bar.\n* Game mode optimizes gaming performance by prioritizing gaming tasks and allocating more [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] and [[Central processing unit|CPU]] capacity to the game. It provides smoother frame rates for game play and reduced latency for   [[Bluetooth]] peripherals, such as wireless game controllers and [[AirPods]].\n* New slow-motion [[screensaver]]s of different locations worldwide. When logged in, they gradually slow down and become the desktop wallpaper.\n* Smoother animations for several areas such as the notification panel, the lock screen, and the show desktop gesture. The notifications now slide in with an ease-out motion, the lock screen now zooms in and out when unlocking and locking, the show desktop gesture has a new spring back animation.\n* Users can react with their hands and animations will pop up based on the [[Gesture recognition|hand gesture]].\n* [[AV1]] hardware decoding has been introduced on devices with AV1 hardware decoding support, such as Macs with SoCs from the [[Apple M3]] family.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-17-release-notes |title=Safari 17 Release Notes |website=Apple Developer |access-date=September 27, 2023 |archive-date=September 21, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230921153353/https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-17-release-notes |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-the-most-advanced-chips-for-a-personal-computer/ | title=Apple unveils M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max, the most advanced chips for a personal computer | date=October 30, 2023 | publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] | access-date=October 31, 2023 | archive-date=October 31, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231031105701/https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-the-most-advanced-chips-for-a-personal-computer/ | url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Print Center, a utility application returning from [[Mac OS X Tiger]], was reintroduced for managing print jobs, viewing different printer queues, and pausing or deleting print jobs.\n* The text cursor now looks more like its iOS counterpart. It is bolder, has a smooth blinking motion, and its color follows the current app's accent color. It also briefly displays an indicator that shows the current input language when the user switches keyboard languages. This indicator can also signal helpful input details like when Caps Lock is on.\n* Videos now encode faster in [[Final Cut Pro]], Compressor, and third-party video applications on Mac computers using M1 Ultra or M2 Ultra. \n* The startup screen is now slightly different, with the loading bar at the bottom being lowered.\n\n=== Gaming ===\nAlongside macOS Sonoma, Apple announced developer tools for porting [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] games to macOS. The Game Porting Toolkit (GPTK), derived from [[Wine (software)|Wine]] and released in beta, translates Windows [[application programming interface]] (API) calls to equivalent macOS APIs, allowing developers to run unmodified versions of their [[x86]] Windows [[DirectX]] games on macOS. Mac users have been able to use the Game Porting Toolkit to run a number of [[DirectX 12]] games; tech news outlets have compared the tool to [[Valve Corporation]]'s [[Proton (software)|Proton]] [[compatibility layer]] for [[Linux]]. Apple also released a Metal Shader Converter that converts shaders to Apple's [[Metal (API)|Metal]] graphics [[API]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Warren |first=Tom |date=June 7, 2023 |title=Apple's new Proton-like tool can run Windows games on a Mac |work=[[The Verge]] |url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23752164/apple-mac-gaming-game-porting-toolkit-windows-games-macos |access-date=June 8, 2023 |archive-date=June 8, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230608130055/https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23752164/apple-mac-gaming-game-porting-toolkit-windows-games-macos |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Purdy |first1=Kevin |title=Apple has a Proton-like Game Porting Toolkit for getting Windows games on Mac |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/ |website=Ars Technica |access-date=June 8, 2023 |language=en-us |date=June 7, 2023 |archive-date=June 8, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230608142344/https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA DigitalFoundry review of the first beta of Game Porting Toolkit found it \"impressive\", with few graphical glitches and full support for console controllers instead of the keyboard, though they found that frame rates were around half of what they would be on Windows, and that many games were not supported.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mackenzie |first=Oliver |date=July 4, 2023 |title=Is Mac on the verge of a gaming revolution? |language=en |work=Eurogamer.net |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-is-mac-on-the-verge-of-a-gaming-revolution-cyberpunk-hogwarts-and-dead-space-tested-w-game-porting-toolkit |access-date=September 1, 2023 |archive-date=September 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901063956/https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-is-mac-on-the-verge-of-a-gaming-revolution-cyberpunk-hogwarts-and-dead-space-tested-w-game-porting-toolkit |url-status=live }}</ref> During the Sonoma beta, updates to the Game Porting Toolkit brought support for [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] games and around 20% better performance.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wegmann |first=Eugen |date=July 5, 2023 |title=macOS Sonoma: Game Porting Toolkit weckt Hoffnungen auf Mac-Gaming |url=https://www.macwelt.de/article/1980362/macos-sonoma-game-porting-toolkit-weckt-hoffnungen-auf-mac-gaming.html |access-date=September 1, 2023 |website=Macwelt |language=de |archive-date=September 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901063956/https://www.macwelt.de/article/1980362/macos-sonoma-game-porting-toolkit-weckt-hoffnungen-auf-mac-gaming.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAccording to reporter Peter Cohen, Game Mode and the Game Porting Toolkit are improvements but do not indicate the kind of \"sea change\" in Apple's priorities and culture that are needed to build a true Mac gaming ecosystem. Cohen says that the problem with Mac gaming is not in the ability to port games, but in a lack of a \"business case\" for game publishers to do so, due to the Mac's low [[Market share analysis|market share]], the cost of supporting a port, and uncertain demand for Mac games when many Mac users also own consoles or gaming PCs.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cohen |first=Peter |date=August 31, 2023 |title=Apple needs to deliver more than Game Mode and the Porting Toolkit |url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/08/31/game-mode-isnt-enough-to-bring-gaming-to-macos-and-apple-needs-to-do-more |access-date=September 1, 2023 |website=AppleInsider |language=en |archive-date=September 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901063958/https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/08/31/game-mode-isnt-enough-to-bring-gaming-to-macos-and-apple-needs-to-do-more |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cohen |first=Peter |date=July 3, 2023 |title=Game Porting Toolkit in macOS Sonoma won't fix what's broken with Mac games |url=https://www.imore.com/mac/macos/game-porting-toolkit-in-macos-sonoma-wont-fix-whats-broken-with-mac-games |access-date=September 1, 2023 |website=iMore |language=en |archive-date=September 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901063956/https://www.imore.com/mac/macos/game-porting-toolkit-in-macos-sonoma-wont-fix-whats-broken-with-mac-games |url-status=live }}</ref> [[YouTuber]] Snazzy Labs issued similar criticisms,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Voorhees |first=John |date=July 3, 2023 |title=Snazzy Labs on the Trouble with Mac Gaming |url=https://www.macstories.net/linked/snazzy-labs-on-the-trouble-with-mac-gaming/ |access-date=September 1, 2023 |language=en-US |archive-date=September 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901063956/https://www.macstories.net/linked/snazzy-labs-on-the-trouble-with-mac-gaming/ |url-status=live }}</ref> which journalist John Siracusa agreed with.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Siracusa |first=John |date=July 3, 2023 |title=I'm not linking this @snazzyq video *just* because it agrees with everything I've been saying for years on @atpfm about Apple and gaming\u2026but it's also not a coincidence that so many knowledgeable people have the same thoughts on the subject. |url=https://mastodon.social/@siracusa/110650944362480116 |access-date=September 1, 2023 |website=Mastodon |language=en |archive-date=September 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901063956/https://mastodon.social/@siracusa/110650944362480116 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Removed features ===\n* Support for legacy [[Apple Mail|Mail]] plug-ins has been removed.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 14, 2023 |title=macOS Sonoma Drops Support for Legacy Mail App Plug-ins |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/14/macos-sonoma-drops-legacy-mail-app-plug-ins/ |access-date=August 14, 2023 |website=MacRumors |language=en |archive-date=August 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230814215625/https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/14/macos-sonoma-drops-legacy-mail-app-plug-ins/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* System API support for converting [[PostScript]] and [[Encapsulated PostScript]] files to PDF format has been removed, following previous changes in macOS Ventura that removed support for viewing and converting PostScript and Encapsulated PostScript files within [[Preview (macOS)|Preview]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=hoakley |date=September 25, 2023 |title=PostScript's sudden death in Sonoma |url=https://eclecticlight.co/2023/09/25/postscripts-sudden-death-in-sonoma/ |access-date=September 25, 2023 |website=The Eclectic Light Company |language=en |archive-date=September 25, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925064759/https://eclecticlight.co/2023/09/25/postscripts-sudden-death-in-sonoma/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Supported hardware ==\nmacOS Sonoma supports Macs with [[Apple silicon]] and Intel's [[Skylake (microarchitecture)#Workstation processors|Xeon-W]] and 8th-generation [[Coffee Lake]]/[[Kaby Lake#Amber Lake|Amber Lake]] chips or later,<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Kubiv |first1=Halyna |title=macOS 14 Sonoma: Diese Macs erhalten kein Update mehr |url=https://www.macwelt.de/article/1944902/macos-14-sonoma-kein-update-fuer-diese-macs.html |magazine=[[Macworld|Macwelt]] |access-date=June 8, 2023 |language=de |date=June 7, 2023 |archive-date=June 7, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230607141332/https://www.macwelt.de/article/1944902/macos-14-sonoma-kein-update-fuer-diese-macs.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and drops support for various models released in 2017, officially marking the end of support for Macs without Retina display and the 12-inch MacBook.
