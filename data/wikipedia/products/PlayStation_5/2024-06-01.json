It was announced as the successor to the [[PlayStation 4]] in April 2019, was launched on November 12, 2020, in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, and was released worldwide one week later. The PS5 is part of the [[ninth generation of video game consoles]], along with [[Microsoft Gaming|Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X/S]] consoles, which were released in the same month.\n\nThe base model includes an [[optical disc drive]] compatible with [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] discs. The Digital Edition lacks this drive, as a lower-cost model for buying games only through [[digital distribution of video games|download]]. The two variants were launched simultaneously. Slimmer hardware revisions of both models replaced the original models on sale in November 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-10-10 |title=New look for PS5 console this holiday season |url=https://blog.playstation.com/2023/10/10/new-look-for-ps5-console-this-holiday-season/ |access-date=2023-10-29 |website=PlayStation.Blog |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation 5's main hardware features include a [[solid-state drive]] customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance, an [[AMD]] [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] capable of [[4K resolution]] display at up to 120 [[Frame rate|frames per second]], hardware-accelerated [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] for realistic lighting and reflections, and the Tempest Engine for hardware-accelerated [[3D audio effect]]s.

This entailed regularly visiting Sony's first-party developers at two-year intervals to find out what concerns they had with shortcomings in Sony's current hardware and how such hardware could be improved in console refreshes or for the next generation. This feedback directly influenced the priorities of the console development team. During the development of the PlayStation 5, a central challenge revolved around addressing the length of loading times for games.<ref name=\"wapost ps5 release\"/> Cerny said several developers, including [[Epic Games]]' [[Tim Sweeney (game developer)|Tim Sweeney]], told him that standard I/O speed of [[hard disk drive]]s was now a limiting factor in pushing game development.<ref>{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJkx-OLgLzo  | archive-url= https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/cJkx-OLgLzo| url-status=live | archive-date=2021-11-20 | title= How PlayStation 5 Was Built (feat.

The top of the screen has a row of applications, and two upper tabs to switch between showing games or media apps. Selecting a game reveals individual activities such as a specific level or multiplayer mode. PlayStation Store is no longer a standalone application and is now fully integrated into the home screen user interface.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.androidheadlines.com/sony-ps5-ui-design-playstation-5.html|title=Why Sony's PS5 UI Is A Masterclass In Design|last=Diaz|first=Justin|work=Android Headlines|date=October 15, 2020|access-date=October 16, 2020|archive-date=October 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020130927/https://www.androidheadlines.com/sony-ps5-ui-design-playstation-5.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe most significant departure from the PS4 interface is the introduction of the Control Center, accessed from the bottom of the screen by pressing the PS button. The Control Center is divided into two sections. The upper portion is a row of cards suggesting actions based on the current game or recent actions such as a group chat. Game-related cards may present players with gameplay information such as a progress report toward completing specific missions, or listing game challenges with an option to jump directly to them. [[PlayStation Plus]] subscribers see game activity cards with hints, tips, screenshots, or videos detailing how to complete the activity. System-level items may present the player with options such as PlayStation Store sale information, or recent screenshots taken by the user to be shared. These features are available for PS5 games or for updated PS4 games. The lower portion of the Control Center contains a customizable horizontal row of icons, including notifications, status updates, friends list, and system settings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517426/playstation-5-ps5-ui-menu-sony-video-watch-first-look|title=Sony gives in-depth look at PlayStation 5 UI in new video|first=Chaim|last=Gartenberg|date=October 15, 2020|access-date=October 15, 2020|work=[[The Verge]]|archive-date=October 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201015180817/https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517426/playstation-5-ps5-ui-menu-sony-video-watch-first-look|url-status=live}}</ref> According to internal materials reviewed by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', the strategy behind this \"activities\"-focused UI was to help players in committing time towards games particularly [[single-player video game]]s which Sony felt were thriving on the PlayStation console environment.
