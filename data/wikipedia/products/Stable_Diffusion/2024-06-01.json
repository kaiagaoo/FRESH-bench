It duplicates the weights of neural network blocks into a \"locked\" copy and a \"trainable\" copy. The \"trainable\" copy learns the desired condition, while the \"locked\" copy preserves the original model. This approach ensures that training with small datasets of image pairs does not compromise the integrity of production-ready diffusion models. The \"zero convolution\" is a 1\u00d71 convolution with both weight and bias initialized to zero. Before training, all zero convolutions produce zero output, preventing any distortion caused by ControlNet. No layer is trained from scratch; the process is still fine-tuning, keeping the original model secure. This method enables training on small-scale or even personal devices.\n\n== Releases ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Version number\n!Release date\n!Notes\n|-\n|1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4<ref>{{Cite web |title=CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 \u00b7 Hugging Face |url=https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230111161920/https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 |archive-date=January 11, 2023 |access-date=2023-08-17 |website=huggingface.co}}</ref>\n|August 2022\n|All released by CompVis.
