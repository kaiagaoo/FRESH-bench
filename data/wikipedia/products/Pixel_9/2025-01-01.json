They serve as the successor to the [[Pixel 8]] and [[Pixel 8 Pro]], respectively. Sporting a redesigned appearance and powered by the fourth-generation [[Google Tensor]] [[system-on-chip]], the phones are heavily integrated with [[Gemini (chatbot)|Gemini]]-branded [[artificial intelligence]] features.\n\nThe Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL were officially announced on August 13, 2024, at the annual [[Made by Google]] event, and were released in the United States<!--Do not add other countries, this is an American product--> on August 22 and September 4.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Pixel 9 & Pixel 9 Pro Hands-On Impressions (ShoAndTech) (2160p 24fps VP9 LQ-160kbit Opus)-00.02.08.000.png|thumb|left|The Pixel 9 ({{abbr|R|right}}) and 9 Pro XL ({{abbr|L|left}}), both in \"Porcelain\" color]]\nThe Pixel 9 series was approved by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in July 2024.<ref name=\"FCC\" /> After previewing the Pro model the same month,<ref name=\"TeaserAP\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Google officially announced the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL on August 13, alongside the [[Pixel 9 Pro Fold]] and [[Pixel Watch 3]], at the annual [[Made by Google]] event.<ref name=\"WiredLaunch\" /> Numerous observers noted the unusually early timing of the launch event, which was traditionally held in October after [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s annual launch of the new [[iPhone]]. Commentators described this as an attempt to \"outshine\" Apple, its longtime rival, and demonstrate its [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) prowess.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"GetJump\" /><ref name=\"StartingLine\" /><ref name=\"ToThePunch\" /><ref name=\"WiredLaunch\" /><ref name=\"WhySoEarly\" /><ref name=\"AIRace\" /><ref name=\"RenewedPush\" />}} Several also took note of Google's usually frequent veiled attacks targeting Apple.<ref name=\"Dinged\" /><ref name=\"AIRace\" /> All three phones became available for pre-order the same day; the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL were made available on August 22 while the Pro will be available on September 4, the latter alongside the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, in 32 countries.<ref name=\"NYTLaunch\" /><ref name=\"Countries\" />\n\n== Specifications ==\n\n=== Design ===\nThe Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL feature a redesigned appearance while retaining the overall [[design language]] that began with the [[Pixel 6]] series, with the edges now flat rather than curved and the camera bar taking the shape of \"an elongated, free-floating [...] oval\".<ref name=\"ProShow\" /><ref name=\"LoveHate\" /> They are each available in four colors:<ref name=\"WiredLaunch\" />\n\n<div class=\"overflowbugx\" style=\"overflow:auto; width:auto\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width:70em; height:18em;\"\n|+ {{Screen reader-only|Color options for the Pixel 8 series}}<!-- Hex codes pulled from Google Store website -->\n! colspan=\"4\" |Pixel 9\n|rowspan=3 style=\"font-size:70%;\" | \n! colspan=\"4\" |Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL\n|-\n| [[File:Google Pixel 9 (Peony) rear.svg|72px|frameless|alt=Diagram of a Pixel 9 smartphone in pink.]]\n| [[File:Google Pixel 9 (Wintergreen) rear.svg|72px|frameless|alt=Diagram of a Pixel 9 smartphone in green.]]\n| [[File:Google Pixel 9 (Porcelain) rear.svg|72px|frameless|alt=Diagram of a Pixel 9 smartphone in white.]]\n| [[File:Google Pixel 9 (Obsidian) rear.svg|72px|frameless|alt=Diagram of a Pixel 9 smartphone in black.]]\n| [[File:Google Pixel 9 Pro (Porcelain) rear.svg|72px|frameless|alt=Diagram of a Pixel 9 Pro smartphone in white.]]\n| [[File:Google Pixel 9 Pro (Rose Quartz) rear.svg|72px|frameless|alt=Diagram of a Pixel 9 Pro smartphone in pink.]]\n| [[File:Google Pixel 9 Pro (Hazel) rear.svg|72px|frameless|alt=Diagram of a Pixel 9 Pro smartphone in gray.]]\n| [[File:Google Pixel 9 Pro (Obsidian) rear.svg|72px|frameless|alt=Diagram of a Pixel 9 Pro smartphone in black.]]\n|-\n| {{Color icon|#FF9CA9|}} Peony\n| {{Color icon|#D7EAD7|}} Wintergreen\n| {{Color icon|#EFEBE8|}} Porcelain\n| {{Color icon|#343434|}} Obsidian\n| {{Color icon|#F5F1EC|}} Porcelain\n| {{Color icon|#F4DDEC|}} Rose Quartz\n| {{Color icon|#949997|}} Hazel\n| {{Color icon|#343434|}} Obsidian\n|}</div>\n\n=== Hardware ===\nIn a departure from previous generations, the Pixel 9 series was offered in three models: the base model, a \"Pro\" model, and a new \"Pro XL\" model.

Dubbed \"Satellite SOS\", Google partnered with [[satellite network]] provider Skylo and SOS dispatch center [[Garmin]] on the feature, which was made available for free for two years.<ref name=\"Satellite9to5\" /><ref name=\"SatelliteWired\" /><ref name=\"SatelliteZDNET\" /> Tensor G4 is also the first SoC to run [[Gemini Nano]], a version of the [[Gemini (language model)|Gemini]] [[large language model]] (LLM), with [[multimodality]].<ref name=\"GeminiNano\" />\n\n=== Software ===\nAs with prior Pixel generations, the Pixel 9 series is equipped with numerous AI-powered features, with the [[Associated Press]] calling it a \"vessel for the AI technology that is expected to reshape the way people live and work\".<ref name=\"AIRace\" /> Google dedicated the first half-hour of its launch event discussing its advances in the field before unveiling its new devices.<ref name=\"Overshadowed\" /> [[Gemini (chatbot)|Gemini]], a generative AI\u2013powered [[chatbot]] launched in 2023 in response to [[OpenAI]]'s [[ChatGPT]], was frequently spotlighted, replacing the [[Google Assistant]] as the new default [[virtual assistant]] on Pixel and heavily integrating into the Pixel 9 series.<ref name=\"TrainWreck\" /><ref name=\"AIPowered\" /> In order to facilitate on-device AI processing, the [[RAM]] on the Pixel 9 series was substantially increased.<ref name=\"AIPowered\" /><ref name=\"EngadgetLaunch\" /> Google also debuted Gemini Live, a new voice chat mode powered by the [[Imagen (Google Brain)|Imagen 3]] [[text-to-image model]].<ref name=\"GeminiLiveVerge\" /><ref name=\"GeminiLiveWSJ\" />\n\nOther AI-powered features included Pixel Studio, an [[Artificial intelligence art|image generation]] app; Pixel Screenshots, a screenshot management and analysis app; Add Me, the ability to retroactively add subjects to photos; Pixel Weather, a new [[weather forecast]] app; Call Notes, which summarizes phone calls while running on-device; and miscellaneous camera updates.<ref name=\"AIFeaturesTC\" /><ref name=\"AIFeaturesVerge\" /><ref name=\"AIFeaturesWired\" /> Breaking with tradition, the Pixel 9 series was shipped with the year-old [[Android 14]] rather than [[Android 15]], likely due to the earlier-than-usual timeframe;<ref name=\"Android15Engadget\" /><ref name=\"Android159to5\" /> the phones were updated with Android 15 via a \"Pixel Drop\" software update, formerly known as Feature Drops, on October 15.<ref name=\"Android15Verge\" /> Continuing the [[Pixel 8]]'s trend, the phones will receive seven years of major OS upgrades, with support extending to 2031.<ref name=\"WiredLaunch\" /><ref name=\"TCLaunch\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nAn \"after party\" livestream hosted by actress [[Keke Palmer]] and featuring celebrity guest appearances followed the Made by Google event.<ref name=\"AfterParty\" /> Days after the phones' launch, Google generated controversy after several [[social media influencers]] part of the seven-year-old #TeamPixel marketing program posted screenshots of a new clause stipulating that participants must not show preference for competitors when creating content with the Pixel 9. Missing context led to confusion online regarding the extent of the restriction, which only applied to #TeamPixel influencers. Google later apologized and removed the clause from the agreement.<ref name=\"TeamPixelVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeamPixelMashable\" /><ref name=\"TeamPixelInc\" />\n\n== Reception ==\nIn his initial reaction to the Pixel 9 series, ''Android Police''{{'s}} Rajesh Pandey praised the overall design but disliked the iPhone-esque flat edges and polished metal frame.<ref name=\"LoveHate\" /> His colleague Taylor Kerns questioned the absence of an \"XL\" version of the base model,<ref name=\"XLHole\" /> while Rebecca Isaacs of ''[[Forbes]]'' welcomed the addition of small-sized Pro model and the enhanced build quality.<ref name=\"ForbesHandsOn\" /> Pandey and Kerns' colleague Will Sattelberg concurred but had mixed reactions to the AI-powered features.<ref name=\"AndroidPoliceHandsOn\" /> Allison Johnson of ''[[The Verge]]'' was impressed by the camera features, writing in a headline, \"The Pixel 9 Pro XL showed me the future of AI photography\".<ref name=\"VergeHandsOn\" /> Writing for ''[[Mashable]]'', Kimberly Gedeon was drawn to the design of the 9 Pro XL, praising the upgraded Super Res Zoom feature and AI-powered features.<ref name=\"MashableHandsOn\" /> ''[[PCMag]]''{{'s}} Iyaz Akhtar called the rear design of the phones \"divisive\" but \"sleek\".<ref name=\"PCMagHandsOn\" /> Kyle Barr of ''[[Gizmodo]]'' and Philip Michaels of ''[[Tom's Guide]]'' both found themselves particularly attracted to the Pixel Screenshots app.<ref name=\"GizmodoHandsOn\" /><ref name=\"TomsGuideHandsOn\" /> Kerry Wan of ''[[ZDNET]]'' predicted that the phones would be a \"[[sleeper hit]]\".<ref name=\"ZDNETHandsOn\" />\n\nThe Pixel 9's Tensor G4 processor has also received mixed reviews.
