Inc.]], first introduced on January 27, 2010. The iPad range consists of the original iPad lineup and the flagship products [[iPad Mini]], [[iPad Air]], and [[iPad Pro]].\n\nThe iPhone's iOS [[operating system]] (OS) was initially used for the iPad but in September 2019, its OS was switched to a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of iOS called iPadOS that has better support for the device's hardware and its user interface is customized for the tablets' larger screens. The iPad's [[App Store (iOS/iPadOS)|App Store]] is subject to application and [[Digital rights management|content approval]]. Many older devices are susceptible to [[IOS jailbreaking|jailbreaking]], which circumvents these restrictions. The [[IPad (1st generation)|original iPad]] was well-received for its software and was recognized as one of the most-influential inventions of 2010.\nAs of the third quarter of 2021, iPad had a market share of 34.6%; beside personal use, the iPad is used in the business, education, healthcare, and technology sectors. There are two variants of iPad; one has only [[Wi-Fi]] and one has support for [[cellular network]]s. [[List of iPad accessories|Accessories for the iPad]] include the [[Apple Pencil]], [[Smart Case]], [[Smart Keyboard]], [[Smart Keyboard Folio]], [[Magic Keyboard for iPad|Magic Keyboard]], and several adapters.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Apple Newton-IMG 0454-cropped.jpg|thumb|The [[Apple Newton|Newton MessagePad]], 1993|alt=A black tablet with a black stylus]]\n\nApple co-founder and CEO [[Steve Jobs]] said in a 1983 speech: \"What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes{{Nbsp}}... and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don't have to hook up to anything and you're in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers\".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Panzarino |first=Matthew |date=October 2, 2012 |title=Rare full recording of 1983 Steve Jobs speech reveals Apple had been working on iPad for 27 years |url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/02/rare-full-recording-of-1983-steve-jobs-speech-reveals-apple-had-been-working-on-ipad-for-27-years |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004223549/http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/02/rare-full-recording-of-1983-steve-jobs-speech-reveals-apple-had-been-working-on-ipad-for-27-years/ |archive-date=October 4, 2012 |access-date=October 2, 2012 |website=The Next Web}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Apple worked on the [[Newton MessagePad]], a tablet-like [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA). John Sculley, Apple's chief executive officer, led the development. The MessagePad was poorly received for its indecipherable [[handwriting recognition]] feature and was discontinued at the direction of Jobs, who returned to Apple in 1998 after an internal power struggle. Apple also prototyped a [[PowerBook Duo]]\u2013based tablet computer but decided not to release it to avoid hurting MessagePad sales.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Stone |first=Brad |author-link=Brad Stone (journalist) |date=September 28, 2009 |title=Apple Rehires a Developer of Its Newton Tablet |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/28/apple-rehires-newton-and-nike-marketing-whiz/ |url-status=live |access-date=March 28, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109030537/https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/28/apple-rehires-newton-and-nike-marketing-whiz/ |archive-date=November 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Smykil |first=Jeff |date=December 1, 2006 |title=Four Apple prototypes I've never heard of |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2006/11/6141/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518102012/https://arstechnica.com/apple/2006/11/6141/ |archive-date=May 18, 2017 |access-date=March 28, 2017 |website=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Huddleston |first=Tom Jr. |date=September 1, 2018 |title=Remember these failed Apple products?

In May 2005, Apple filed US Design Patent No. D504,889 that included an illustration depicting a man touching and using a tablet device.

Double-clicking the Home Button or swiping up from the bottom of the screen and pausing will display all currently active spaces. Each space can feature a single app, or a Split View featuring two apps. The user can also swipe left or right on the Home Indicator to go between spaces at any time, or swipe left/right with four fingers.<ref name=\"pcmag.com\">{{Cite web |title=How to Use Multitasking on Your iPad |url=https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/use-multitasking-on-your-ipad |access-date=February 10, 2022 |website=PC Magazine |language=en |archive-date=February 10, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220210044347/https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/use-multitasking-on-your-ipad |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn iPadOS, while using an app, swiping up slightly from the bottom edge of the screen will summon the Dock, where apps stored within can be dragged to different areas of the current space to be opened in either Split View or Slide Over. Dragging an app to the left or right edge of the screen will create a Split View, which will allow both apps to be used side by side. The size of the two apps in Split View can be adjusted by dragging a pill-shaped icon in the center of the vertical divider and dragging the divider all the way to one side of the screen closes the respective app. If the user drags an app from the dock over the current app, it will create a floating window called Slide Over which can be dragged to either the left or right side of the screen. A Slide Over window can be hidden by swiping it off the right side of the screen, and swiping left from the right edge of the screen will restore it. Slide Over apps can also be cycled between by swiping left or right on the Home Indicator in the Slide Over window and pulling up on it will open an app switcher for Slide Over windows. A pill-shaped icon at the top of apps in Split View or Slide Over allows them to be switched in an out of Split View and Slide Over.<ref name=\"pcmag.com\" />\n\n== Model support status ==\n{{Further|List of iPad models}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Legend:\n|{{Legend inline|#ff9999|{{abbr|Obsolete|Device is discontinued more than 7 years ago and no longer provide hardware support and services from Apple worldwide}}|border=1px solid #aaa}}\n|{{Legend inline|#ffdddd|{{abbr|Vintage|Device is discontinued between 5 and 7 years ago and hardware support and services provided only on Apple in the United States and Turkey}}|border=1px solid #aaa}}\n|{{Legend inline|#ddd|{{abbr|Unsupported|Discontinued device that is no longer receiving major OS updates.}}|border=1px solid #aaa}}\n|{{Legend inline|#f8eaba|{{abbr|Discontinued|Discontinued older device versions, not currently being sold.}}|border=1px solid #aaa}}\n|{{Legend inline|#d4f4b4|{{abbr|Current|Current versions of devices being sold.}}|border=1px solid #aaa}}\n|{{Legend inline|#c1e6f5|{{abbr|Upcoming|Announced device that is yet to be released.}}|border=1px solid #aaa}}\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

not employ [[digital rights management]] (DRM), but the OS prevents users from copying or transferring certain content outside of Apple's platform without authorization, such as TV shows, movies, and apps. Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process and control of the platform itself could stifle software innovation. Of particular concern to [[digital rights]] advocates is Apple's ability to remotely disable or delete apps on any iPad at any time.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Bobbie |date=February 1, 2010 |title=Apple iPad will choke innovation, say open internet advocates |work=The Guardian |location=UK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/01/apple-ipad-choke-innovation |url-status=live |access-date=February 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316141036/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/01/apple-ipad-choke-innovation |archive-date=March 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=January 31, 2010 |title=Apple's Trend Away From Tinkering |url=http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/01/31/1657233/Apples-Trend-Away-From-Tinkering |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208164828/http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/01/31/1657233/Apples-Trend-Away-From-Tinkering |archive-date=February 8, 2010 |access-date=February 12, 2010 |website=[[Slashdot]]}}</ref><ref name=\"criticism-eff\">{{Cite web |date=March 9, 2010 |title=All Your Apps Are Belong to Apple: The iPhone Developer Program License Agreement |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/iphone-developer-program-license-agreement-all |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414130610/http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/iphone-developer-program-license-agreement-all |archive-date=April 14, 2010 |access-date=April 17, 2010 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]}}</ref>\n\nDigital rights advocates, including the [[Free Software Foundation]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lee |first=Matt |date=May 19, 2011 |title=Apple's iOS: smaller package, bigger restrictions |url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/iphone |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123074718/http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/iphone |archive-date=January 23, 2013 |access-date=January 28, 2013 |website=[[Free Software Foundation]]}}</ref> [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]],<ref name=\"criticism-eff\" /> and computer engineer and activist [[Brewster Kahle]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Johnson |first=Bobbie |date=February 1, 2010 |title=Apple iPad will choke innovation, say open internet advocates |url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/01/apple-ipad-choke-innovation |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220130223333/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/01/apple-ipad-choke-innovation |archive-date=January 30, 2022 |access-date=February 4, 2022 |website=[[The Guardian]] |language=en}}</ref> have criticized the iPad for its digital rights restrictions.
