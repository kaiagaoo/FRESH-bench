According to Kevin Lynch, the team felt people spent too much time on their phone, nagged by notifications, and a watch would provide \"that level of engagement [...] in a way that's a little more human, a little more at the moment when you're with somebody\".<ref name=\"wired.com\" />\n\nIn July 2013, ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that Apple had begun hiring more employees to work on the smartwatch, and that it was targeting a retail release in late 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 14, 2013 |title=Apple on iWatch hiring blitz ahead of possible late 2014 launch, says Financial Times |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522898/apple-on-iwatch-hiring-blitz-and-could-launch-next-year-says/in/4286985 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715104924/http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522898/apple-on-iwatch-hiring-blitz-and-could-launch-next-year-says/in/4286985 |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |access-date=July 15, 2015 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref>\n\nThe software evolved more quickly than the hardware. To test it, the team created its first prototype, an iPhone strapped to the wrist with Velcro, which showed the Apple watch software in its true size and an onscreen watch crown for input. The crown was later turned into a physical dongle plugged into the headphone jack. Early on, the user interface and bundled apps were inspired by the iPhone, but they were too complex and underwent three rounds of redesigns, to avoid awkwardly long interactions that would annoy users. The team worked on notification vibrations and sounds for more than a year, attempting to make them reflect the nature of different notifications. They also added a way to show a contextual menu by pressing the display more deeply, called Force Touch. In contrast with Apple's usually narrow design options, the team thought a watch would need to appeal to users' diverse tastes in fashion, so they opted to give a choice of bands, models (like the gold-plated Apple Watch Edition) and watch faces.<ref name=\"wired.com\" />\n\n== Unveiling and release ==\n\nIn April 2014, Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] told ''The Wall Street Journal'' that the company was planning to launch new products that year, but revealed no specifics.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wakabayashi |first=Daisuke |date=April 24, 2014 |title=Apple's Cook on New Products: 'Take the Time to Get It Right' |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/04/24/apples-cook-on-new-products-take-the-time-to-get-it-right |url-status=live |access-date=July 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715150709/http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/04/24/apples-cook-on-new-products-take-the-time-to-get-it-right |archive-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2014, [[Reuters]] reported that production of a smartwatch product was expected to begin in July for an October release.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 19, 2014 |title=Apple's iWatch may launch in October with 2.5-inch screen, says Reuters |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/19/5825178/apple-iwatch-could-launch-in-october/in/4286985 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308231328/https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/19/5825178/apple-iwatch-could-launch-in-october/in/4286985 |archive-date=March 8, 2018 |access-date=August 30, 2017}}{{Subscription required}}</ref>\n\nDuring a September 2014 press event where the [[iPhone 6]] was also presented, the new watch product was introduced by Tim Cook's \"one more thing\" section.
