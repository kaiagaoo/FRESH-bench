It succeeded [[Windows 10]] (2015) and is available for free for any Windows 10 devices that meet the new Windows 11 system requirements.\n\nWindows 11 features major changes to the [[Windows shell]] influenced by the canceled [[Windows 10X]], including a redesigned [[Start menu]], the replacement of its \"live tiles\" with a separate \"Widgets\" panel on the [[taskbar]], the ability to create tiled sets of windows that can be minimized and restored from the taskbar as a group, and new gaming technologies inherited from [[Xbox Series X and Series S]] such as [[high-dynamic-range video|Auto HDR]] and [[DirectStorage]] on compatible hardware. [[Internet Explorer]] (IE) has been replaced by the [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]]-based [[Microsoft Edge]] as the default web browser, like its predecessor, [[Windows 10]], and [[Microsoft Teams]] is integrated into the Windows shell. Microsoft also announced plans to allow more flexibility in software that can be distributed via the [[Microsoft Store]] and to support [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[mobile app|apps]] on Windows 11 (including a partnership with [[Amazon Appstore|Amazon]] to make its [[app store]] available for the function).\n\nCiting security considerations, the system requirements for Windows 11 were increased over Windows 10. Microsoft only officially supports the operating system on devices using an [[Coffee Lake|eighth-generation]] [[Intel Core]] CPU or newer (with some minor exceptions), a [[Zen+|second-generation]] [[Ryzen|AMD Ryzen]] CPU or newer, or a [[List of Qualcomm Snapdragon systems on chips#Mobile Compute Platforms|Qualcomm Snapdragon 850]] [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[System on a chip|system-on-chip]] or newer, with [[UEFI]] and [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM) 2.0 supported and enabled (although Microsoft may provide exceptions to the TPM 2.0 requirement for OEMs). While the OS can be installed on unsupported processors, Microsoft does not guarantee the availability of [[Windows Update|updates]]. Windows 11 removed support for [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] [[x86]] and 32-bit ARM CPUs and devices that use [[BIOS]] firmware.\n\nWindows 11 has received a mostly positive reception. Pre-release coverage of the operating system focused on its stricter hardware requirements, with discussions over whether they were legitimately intended to improve the security of Windows or as a ploy to [[upsell]] customers to newer devices and over the [[e-waste]] associated with the changes. Upon release, it was praised for its improved visual design, window management, and stronger focus on security, but was criticized for various modifications to aspects of its user interface that were seen as worse than its predecessor; some were seen as an attempt to dissuade users from switching to competing applications.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Warren |first=Tom |date=August 18, 2021 |title=Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11 |url=https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes |access-date=January 10, 2023 |website=[[The Verge]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2023|10}}, Windows 11, at 24.42% worldwide,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Worldwide |url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202106-202310 |access-date=October 8, 2023 |website=StatCounter Global Stats |language=en}}</ref> is the second most popular Windows version in use, with its predecessor Windows 10 at three times the market share.

It is bundled with applications such as [[Microsoft Office]] for [[Microsoft 365]], ''[[Minecraft Education Edition]]'', and Flipgrid, while [[OneDrive]] is used to save files by default. Windows 11 SE does not include Microsoft Store; third-party software is provisioned or installed by administrators.

The 38 fully-localized Language Pack (LP) languages were available as both lp.cab and .appx packages, while the remaining 72 partially-localized Language Interface Pack (LIP) languages were only available as .appx packages.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rudra |first=Rittwika |date=September 16, 2021 |title=Update to language imaging in Windows 11 |url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-language-imaging-in-windows-11/ba-p/2758043 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220126045009/https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-language-imaging-in-windows-11/ba-p/2758043 |archive-date=January 26, 2022 |access-date=January 26, 2022 |website=Microsoft Communities |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith Windows 11, that process has changed. Five new LP languages were added \u2014 Catalan, Basque, Galician, Indonesian, and Vietnamese \u2014 bringing the total number of LP languages to 43. Furthermore, these 43 languages can only be imaged using lp.cab packages. This is to ensure a fully supported language-imaging and cumulative update experience.\n\nThe remaining 67 LIP languages that are LXP-based will move to a self-service model, and can only be added by Windows users themselves via the Microsoft Store and Windows Settings apps, not during the Windows imaging process. Any user, not just admins, can now add both the display language and its features, which can help users in business environments, but these exact options for languages (both LP and LIP) still depend on the OEM and mobile operator.\n\n==Updates and support==\nLike Windows 10, Windows 11 follows Microsoft's Modern Lifecycle Policy. Each annual feature update has its own support lifecycle: two years for the Home and Pro editions, and three years for the Education and Enterprise editions. Microsoft has stated that Windows 11 provides no lifecycle guarantee if it has been installed on a machine that does not meet its minimum hardware requirements.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bott |first=Ed |date=December 19, 2022 |title=When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/ |access-date=March 29, 2023 |website=ZDNet |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWindows 11 receives annual major updates, though Microsoft sometimes adds major features in mid-cycle releases.

Cunningham concluded that \"as I've dug into [Windows 11] and learned its ins and outs for this review, I've warmed to it more\", but argued that the OS was facing similar \"public perception\" issues to [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 8]].
