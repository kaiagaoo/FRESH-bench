latest major release of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows NT]] operating system, released on October 5, 2021. It succeeded [[Windows 10]] (2015), and is available for free for any Windows 10 devices that meet the new [[Windows 11#System requirements|Windows 11 system requirements]].\n\nWindows 11 features major changes to the [[Windows shell]] influenced by the canceled [[Windows 10X]], including a redesigned [[Start menu]], the replacement of its \"live tiles\" with a separate \"Widgets\" panel on the [[taskbar]], the ability to create tiled sets of windows that can be minimized and restored from the taskbar as a group, and new gaming technologies inherited from [[Xbox Series X and Series S]] such as Auto [[high-dynamic-range video|HDR]] and [[DirectStorage]] on compatible hardware. [[Internet Explorer]] (IE) has been replaced by the [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]]-based [[Microsoft Edge]] as the default web browser, like its predecessor, Windows 10, and [[Microsoft Teams]] is integrated into the Windows shell. Microsoft also announced plans to allow more flexibility in software that can be distributed via the [[Microsoft Store]] and to support [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps on Windows 11 (including a partnership with [[Amazon Appstore|Amazon]] to make its [[app store]] available for the purpose).\n\nCiting security considerations, the system requirements for Windows 11 were increased over Windows 10; Microsoft only officially supports the operating system on devices using an [[Coffee Lake|eighth-generation Intel Core]] CPU or newer (with some minor exceptions), a [[Zen+|second-generation AMD Ryzen]] CPU or newer, or a [[List of Qualcomm Snapdragon systems on chips#Mobile Compute Platforms|Qualcomm Snapdragon 850]] ARM system-on-chip or newer, with [[UEFI]] and [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM) 2.0 supported and enabled. Although, there are some exceptions to these requirements (see {{section link||System requirements}} for details). While the OS can be installed on devices with unsupported configurations, Microsoft does not guarantee the availability of [[Windows Update|updates]]. Furthermore, Windows 11 completely removes support for [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] CPUs, including both 32-bit x86 and 32-bit ARM processors, ensuring compatibility only with 64-bit [[x86-64]] and [[ARM64]] processors.\n\nWindows 11 received a mixed reception at launch. Pre-release coverage of the operating system focused on its stricter hardware requirements, with discussions over whether they were legitimately intended to improve the security of Windows, or as a ploy to [[upsell]] customers to newer devices, and over the [[e-waste]] associated with the changes. Upon release, it was praised for its improved visual design, window management, and stronger focus on security, but was criticized for various modifications to aspects of its user interface that were seen as worse than its predecessor; some were seen as an attempt to dissuade users from switching to competing applications.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Warren |first=Tom |date=August 18, 2021 |title=Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11 |url=https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes |access-date=January 10, 2023 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref> Additionally, some users have pointed out disadvantages such as the removal of features like the ability to move the taskbar and increased system requirements that may exclude older devices.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Raymond |first=Daniel |date=January 21, 2024 |title=Top 10 Disadvantages of Windows 11 |url=https://projectmanagers.net/top-10-cons-disadvantages-of-windows-11/ |access-date=September 2, 2024 |website=[[ProjectManagers.net]]}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2024|11}}, Windows 11, accounting for 35% of Windows installations worldwide,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Worldwide |url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202106-202410 |access-date=September 30, 2024 |website=StatCounter Global Stats}}</ref> is the second most popular Windows version in use, with its predecessor Windows 10 still being the most used version in virtually all countries (with [[Guyana]] being an exception, where Windows 11 is the most used<ref>{{Cite web |title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Guyana |url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/guyana/#monthly-202309-202408 |access-date=2024-09-30 |website=StatCounter Global Stats |language=en}}</ref><!-- Possibly in Fiji too; all exceptional countries might be a fluctuations/unreliable data like Chile was: <ref>{{Cite web |title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Chile |url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/chile/ |access-date=2024-07-19 |website=StatCounter Global Stats |language=en}}</ref> https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/chile/#monthly-202307-202406 https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/chile/#quarterly-202401-202402 and https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/guyana/#monthly-202307-202406 and Equatorial Guinea) -->), with it globally at over 2 times the market share.

The 38 fully-localized Language Pack (LP) languages were available as both lp.cab and .appx packages, while the remaining 72 partially-localized Language Interface Pack (LIP) languages were only available as .appx packages.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rudra |first=Rittwika |date=September 16, 2021 |title=Update to language imaging in Windows 11 |url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-language-imaging-in-windows-11/ba-p/2758043 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220126045009/https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-language-imaging-in-windows-11/ba-p/2758043 |archive-date=January 26, 2022 |access-date=January 26, 2022 |website=Microsoft Communities}}</ref>\n\nWith Windows 11, that process has changed. Five new LP languages were added \u2014 Catalan, Basque, Galician, Indonesian, and Vietnamese \u2014 bringing the total number of LP languages to 43. Furthermore, these 43 languages can only be imaged using lp.cab packages. This is to ensure a fully supported language-imaging and cumulative update experience.\n\nThe remaining 67 LIP languages that are LXP-based will move to a self-service model, and can only be added by Windows users themselves via the Microsoft Store and Windows Settings apps, not during the Windows imaging process. Any user, not just admins, can now add both the display language and its features, which can help users in business environments, but these exact options for languages (both LP and LIP) still depend on the OEM and mobile operator.\n\n== Updates and support ==\n{{main|Windows 11 version history}}\nLike Windows 10, Windows 11 follows Microsoft's Modern Lifecycle Policy. Each annual feature update has its own support lifecycle: two years for the Home and Pro editions, and three years for the Education and Enterprise editions.

He praised the improvements to its visual design (describing the new \"Mica\" appearance as reminiscent of the visual appearance of [[iOS]] and [[macOS]], and arguing that Microsoft had \"[made] a serious effort\" at making the user-facing aspects of Windows 11 more consistent visually. He also praised window management, performance (assessed as being equivalent to if not better than Windows 10), other \"beneficial tweaks\". Criticism was raised towards Widgets' lack of support for third-party content, thus limiting it to Microsoft services only, regressions in taskbar functionality and customization. He also noted the inability to easily select default applications for common tasks such as web browsing, as it requires the user to select the browser application for each [[File format|file type]] individually. Apart from the user interface, system requirements and Microsoft's unclear justification for its processor compatibility criteria remained a major sticking point for him. While some of the system requirements have brought greater public attention to hardware security features present on modern PCs, he argued that these could already be employed on Windows 10, albeit optionally. Cunningham concluded that \"as I've dug into [Windows 11] and learned its ins and outs for this review, I've warmed to it more\", but argued that the OS was facing similar \"public perception\" issues to [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 8]]. However, he noted that 11 did not have as many performance issues or bugs as Vista had upon its release, nor was as \"disjointed\" as 8, and recommended that users who were unsure about the upgrade should stay on Windows 10 in anticipation of future updates to 11.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web |last=Cunningham |first=Andrew |date=October 4, 2021 |title=Windows 11: The Ars Technica review |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-the-ars-technica-review/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005012526/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-the-ars-technica-review/ |archive-date=October 5, 2021 |access-date=October 5, 2021 |website=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref>\n\nTom Warren of ''[[The Verge]]'' described Windows 11 as being akin to a house in the middle of renovations, but that \"actually using Windows 11 for the past few months hasn't felt as controversial as I had expected\"\u2014praising its updated user interface as being more modern and reminiscent of [[iOS]] and [[ChromeOS]], the new start menu for feeling less cluttered than the [[Windows 10]] iteration, updates to some of its stock applications, and Snap Assist. Warren noted that he rarely used the Widgets panel or [[Microsoft Teams]], citing that he preferred the weather display that later versions of [[Windows 10]] offered, and did not use Teams to communicate with his friends and family. He also acknowledged the expansion of the [[Microsoft Store]] to include more \"traditional\" desktop applications. However, he felt that Windows 11 still felt like a work in progress, noting [[User interface|UI]] inconsistencies (such as dark mode and new [[context menu]] designs not being uniform across all dialogues and applications, and the [[Universal Windows Platform apps|UWP]] Settings app still falling back upon legacy [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] applets for certain settings), regressions to the [[taskbar]] (including the inability to move it, drag files onto taskbar buttons to focus the corresponding application, and the clock only shown on the primary display in [[multi-monitor]] configurations), and promised features (such as dynamic refresh rate support and a universal microphone mute button) not being present on the initial release. Overall, he concluded that \"I wouldn't rush out to upgrade to Windows 11, but I also wouldn't avoid it. After all, Windows 11 still feels familiar and underneath all the [[User interface|UI]] changes, it's the same [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] we've had for decades.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Warren |first=Tom |date=October 4, 2021 |title=Windows 11 review: a familiar home that's still being renovated |url=https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211004234808/https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review |archive-date=October 4, 2021 |access-date=October 5, 2021 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref>\n\nMark Hatchman of ''[[PC World]]'' was more critical of Windows 11, arguing that it \"sacrifices productivity for personality, but without cohesion\", commenting upon changes such as the inability to use local \"offline\" accounts on Windows 11 Home, regressions to the [[taskbar]], a \"functionally worse\" [[start menu]], [[Microsoft Teams]] integration having privacy implications and being a ploy to coerce users into switching to the service, [[File Explorer]] obscuring common functions under unclear icons, forcing users to scroll through many options to discourage changing the default web browser from Microsoft Edge, and that the OS \"anecdotally feels less responsive, slower, and heavier than Windows 10\". He concluded that Windows 11 \"feels practical and productive, but less so than its predecessor in many aspects\", while its best features were either \"hidden deeper within\", required specific hardware (DirectStorage, Auto HDR) or were not available on launch (Android app support).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=October 4, 2021 |title=Windows 11 review: An unnecessary replacement for Windows 10 |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/539183/windows-11-review-an-unnecessary-replacement-for-windows-10.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005002142/https://www.pcworld.com/article/539183/windows-11-review-an-unnecessary-replacement-for-windows-10.html |archive-date=October 5, 2021 |access-date=October 5, 2021 |website=[[PCWorld]]}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of operating systems]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Official website}}\n*[https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information Windows 11 release information] from Microsoft\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box\n| title  = Windows 11\n| years  = 2021\n| before = [[Windows 10]]\n| after  = ''TBA''\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Microsoft Windows family}}\n{{Microsoft Windows components}}\n{{Windows 11 version history}}\n\n[[Category:Windows 11| ]]\n[[Category:Windows NT|11]]\n[[Category:2021 software]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system)]]\n[[Category:ARM operating systems]]\n[[Category:Proprietary operating systems]]\n[[Category:Tablet operating systems]]\n[[Category:X86-64 operating systems]]\n[[Category:Microsoft Windows]]"}
