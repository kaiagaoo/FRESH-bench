It is a free upgrade to its predecessor, [[Windows 10]] (2015), and is available for any Windows 10 devices that meet the new Windows 11 system requirements.\n\nWindows 11 features major changes to the Windows [[shell (computing)|shell]] influenced by the canceled [[Windows 10X]], including a redesigned [[Start menu]], the replacement of its \"live tiles\" with a separate \"Widgets\" panel on the [[taskbar]], the ability to create tiled sets of windows that can be minimized and restored from the taskbar as a group, and new gaming technologies inherited from [[Xbox Series X and Series S]] such as [[high-dynamic-range video|Auto HDR]] and [[DirectStorage]] on compatible hardware. [[Internet Explorer]] (IE) has been replaced by the [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]]-based [[Microsoft Edge]] as the default web browser, like its predecessor, [[Windows 10]], and [[Microsoft Teams]] is integrated into the Windows shell. Microsoft also announced plans to allow more flexibility in software that can be distributed via the [[Microsoft Store]] and to support [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[mobile app|apps]] on Windows 11 (including a partnership with [[Amazon Appstore|Amazon]] to make its [[app store]] available for the function).\n\nCiting security considerations, the system requirements for Windows 11 were increased over Windows 10. Microsoft only officially supports the operating system on devices using an [[Coffee Lake|eighth-generation]] [[Intel Core]] CPU or newer (with some minor exceptions), a second-generation [[Ryzen|AMD Ryzen]] CPU or newer, or a [[List of Qualcomm Snapdragon processors#Snapdragon 835, 850, 7c, 7c Gen 2, 8c, 8cx and 8cx Gen 2|Qualcomm Snapdragon 850]] [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[System on a chip|system-on-chip]] or newer, with [[UEFI secure boot]] and [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM) 2.0 supported and enabled (although Microsoft may provide exceptions to the TPM 2.0 requirement for OEMs). While the OS can be installed on unsupported processors, Microsoft does not guarantee the availability of [[Windows Update|updates]]. Windows 11 removed support for [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] [[x86]] CPUs and devices that use [[BIOS]] firmware.\n\nWindows 11 received a mixed reception at launch. Pre-release coverage of the operating system focused on its stricter hardware requirements, with discussions over whether they were legitimately intended to improve the security of Windows or as a ploy to [[upsell]] customers to newer devices and over the [[e-waste]] associated with the changes. Upon release, it was praised for its improved visual design, window management, and a stronger focus on security, but was criticized for various modifications to aspects of its user interface that were seen as worse than its predecessor, as an attempt to dissuade users from switching to competing applications.<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11]</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nAt the 2015 [[Microsoft Ignite|Ignite conference]], Microsoft employee Jerry Nixon stated that [[Windows 10]] would be the \"last version of Windows\", a statement that Microsoft confirmed was \"reflective\" of its view.<ref>{{cite web |date=April 30, 2015 |title=Windows forever: Windows 10 builds will continue even after Microsoft ships it |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2917474/windows-forever-windows-10-builds-will-continue-even-after-microsoft-ships-it.html |access-date=June 16, 2021 |website=PCWorld |archive-date=March 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210302150358/https://www.pcworld.com/article/2917474/windows-forever-windows-10-builds-will-continue-even-after-microsoft-ships-it.html |url-status=live |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Windows 10 Takes Its Place as Microsoft's 'Forever OS' |url=https://redmondmag.com/blogs/scott-bekker/2019/01/windows-10-microsofts-forever-os.aspx |access-date=June 16, 2021 |website=Redmondmag |archive-date=April 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210409165315/https://redmondmag.com/blogs/scott-bekker/2019/01/windows-10-microsofts-forever-os.aspx |url-status=live |language=en-US}}</ref> The operating system was considered [[Software as a service|to be a service]], with new builds and updates to be released over time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.informationweek.com/software/operating-systems/windows-10-microsoft-attempts-a-saas-model/a/d-id/1321473 |title=Windows 10: Microsoft Attempts A SaaS Model |last1=Loeb |first1=Larry |date=July 28, 2015 |work=InformationWeek |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508071939/https://www.informationweek.com/software/operating-systems/windows-10-microsoft-attempts-a-saas-model/a/d-id/1321473 |archive-date=May 8, 2021 |access-date=June 27, 2021 |url-status=live |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, Microsoft announced \"[[Windows 10 editions|Windows 10X]]\", a future edition of Windows 10 designed exclusively for [[dual-touchscreen]] devices such as the then-upcoming [[Surface Neo]].

It is bundled with applications such as [[Microsoft Office]] for [[Microsoft 365]], ''[[Minecraft Education Edition]]'', and Flipgrid, while [[OneDrive]] is used to save files by default. Windows 11 SE does not include Microsoft Store; third-party software is provisioned or installed by administrators.

Criticism was raised towards Widgets' lack of support for third-party content (thus limiting it to Microsoft services only), regressions in taskbar functionality and customization, the inability to easily select default applications for common tasks such as web browsing (now requiring the user to select the browser application for each [[File format|file type]] individually), and Microsoft's unclear justification for its processor compatibility criteria. Cunningham concluded that \"as I've dug into [Windows 11] and learned its ins and outs for this review, I've warmed to it more\", but argued that the OS was facing similar \"public perception\" issues to [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 8]]. However, he noted that 11 did not have as many performance issues or bugs as Vista had upon its release, nor was as \"disjointed\" as 8, and recommended that users who were unsure about the upgrade should stay on Windows 10 in anticipation of future updates to 11.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web |last=Cunningham |first=Andrew |date=October 4, 2021 |title=Windows 11: The Ars Technica review |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-the-ars-technica-review/ |access-date=October 5, 2021 |website=Ars Technica |language=en-US |archive-date=October 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005012526/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-the-ars-technica-review/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nTom Warren of ''[[The Verge]]'' described Windows 11 as being akin to a house in the middle of renovations, but that \"actually using Windows 11 for the past few months hasn't felt as controversial as I had expected\"\u2014praising its updated user interface as being more modern and reminiscent of iOS and [[ChromeOS]], the new start menu for feeling less cluttered than the Windows 10 iteration, updates to some of its stock applications, and Snap Assist. Warren noted that he rarely used the Widgets panel or Microsoft Teams, citing that he preferred the weather display that later versions of Windows 10 offered, and didn't use Teams to communicate with his friends and family. He also acknowledged the expansion of Microsoft Store to include more \"traditional\" desktop applications. However, he felt that Windows 11 still felt like a work in progress, noting UI inconsistencies (such as dark mode and new context menu designs not being uniform across all dialogues and applications, and the modern Settings app still falling back upon legacy [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] applets for certain settings), regressions to the taskbar (including the inability to move it, drag files onto taskbar buttons to focus the corresponding application, and the clock only shown on the primary display in multi-monitor configurations), and promised features (such as dynamic refresh rate support and a universal microphone mute button) not being present on the initial release. Overall, he concluded that \"I wouldn't rush out to upgrade to Windows 11, but I also wouldn't avoid it.
