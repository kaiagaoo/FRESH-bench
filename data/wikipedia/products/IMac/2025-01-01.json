Introduced by [[Steve Jobs]] in August 1998 when the company was financially troubled, the computer was an inexpensive, consumer-oriented computer that would easily connect to the Internet. Since that time, it has remained a primary part of Apple's consumer desktop offerings and evolved through seven distinct forms.\n\nThe design of the iMac has been seen as both controversial and trendsetting. From its introduction, the computer has eschewed many entrenched legacy technologies, notably becoming an early adopter of the [[USB port]], and removing [[floppy disk]] and later [[optical disc]] drives.\n\nIn its original form, the [[iMac G3]] had a [[gumdrop]], [[ADM-3A#ADM-3|ADM-3]] or [[Oval#Egg shape|egg-shaped]] look, with a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitor, mainly enclosed by a colored, [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]] plastic case. The second major revision, the [[iMac G4]], moved a design with a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth revisions, the [[iMac G5]] and the [[iMac (Intel-based)|Intel iMac]], placed all the components immediately behind the display in a plastic casing, creating a slim unified design that tilts only up and down on a simple metal base. The fifth, sixth and seventh revisions swapped the plastic enclosure for metal and became progressively thinner over each revision.\n\nThe most recent revision, the [[IMac (Apple silicon)|Apple Silicon iMac]], uses Apple's own processors (silicon) and is {{Convert|11.5|mm|sp=us}} thick. Between 2017 and 2021, Apple also sold a workstation-class version of the computer called the [[iMac Pro]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Timeline of the product Apple iMac.svg|thumb|600x600px|The timeline of iMac from 1998 to 2021, comparing it with the original [[Macintosh 128K]] (1984). This chart shows the change in the physical characteristics and appearance of the product.]]\nApple was facing bankruptcy in the mid-1990s, with its market share cannibalized by Windows-based PCs and Macintosh clones. The company had tried and failed to ship a modern operating system for its hardware. Looking instead for an outside product to acquire, Apple announced its purchase of [[NeXT|NexT, Inc.]] in 1996. Alongside Next's products and software came [[Steve Jobs]], Apple's co-founder who had been ousted from the company years earlier. Jobs initially was brought on at Apple as an adviser, but Jobs replaced [[Gil Amelio]] as interim CEO in 1997 and began a reorganization of the company. He reduced Apple's multitude of confusing computer options to just four: one laptop and one desktop model for consumers, and another laptop and desktop model for professionals. What became the iMac began as Apple's effort to develop the consumer desktop to fill that product gap.{{cn|date=August 2024}}\n\nApple's head of design [[Jony Ive]] and the rest of the design team developed sketches for a distinctive, [[all-in-one computer]] that was to be a [[legacy-free PC]] focused on ease of use and internet connectivity. The design team made the new computer colorful and translucent, built around a cathode-ray tube display wrapped in a curved plastic case. Ad agency director [[Ken Segall]] suggested the \"iMac\" name: it was short, had \"Mac\" in it, and the \"i\" prefix suggested the internet. Jobs initially hated it, but the name ultimately stuck.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Segall |first=Ken |title=Insanely simple: the obsession that drives Apple's success |publisher=The Penguin Group |date=2013 |isbn=978-1-5918-4621-5 |edition=2nd}}</ref>{{rp|109\u2013110}} Apple later [[Internet-related prefixes#\"i-\"|adopted the 'i' prefix]] across its consumer hardware and software lines, such as [[iPod]], [[iBook]] (later MacBook), [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and various pieces of software such as the [[iLife]], [[iCloud]] suite and [[iWork]] and the company's media player/store, [[iTunes]].{{cn|date=August 2024}}\n[[File:IMac_M4_2024.jpg|thumb|Three of the seven iMac colors available in 2024\u2014blue, green and pink\u2014with corresponding Magic Keyboards]]\nDespite mixed reviews from the tech press, the iMac was a major commercial success at a time when Apple desperately needed a hit product.<ref name=\"sixcolors_2020_12_28\">{{Cite web |last=Snell |first=Jason |date=December 28, 2020 |title=20 Macs for 2020: #1 \u2013 iMac G3|url=https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/12/20-macs-for-2020-1-imac-g3 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230112065737/https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/12/20-macs-for-2020-1-imac-g3 |archive-date=January 12, 2023 |access-date=November 21, 2022 |website=Six Colors}}</ref> The iMac ultimately sold more than six million units, being revised multiple times and appearing in 13 different colors and patterns.{{cn|date=August 2024}} The iMac was \"designed to make it easy for home users to connect to the Internet.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=McIntosh |first=Jane |title=History of the World in 1,000 Objects |last2=Chrisp |first2=Peter |last3=Parker |first3=Philip |last4=Gibson |first4=Carrie |last5=Grant |first5=R.

Inspired by a sunflower, the [[iMac G4]] put the computer in a semi-hemispherical base, with the display sitting above it on a stainless steel arm. The arm allowed the display to be easily tilted, rotated, and raised and lowered by a touch. The exuberant colors of the old iMac was replaced by stark white.{{cn|date=August 2024}}\n\nEver-increasing screen sizes led Apple to make the [[iMac G5]] a more conservative design, with the components of the computer attached to the back of the display and raised above the resting surface with an aluminum foot.{{cn|date=August 2024}}\n\nBy 2005, it had become more and more apparent that IBM's development for the desktop implementation of PowerPC was grinding to a halt. Apple announced at the [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] that it would be [[Mac transition to Intel processors|switching the Macintosh to the x86 architecture]] and Intel's line of Core processors. The first Intel-equipped Macs were unveiled on January 10, 2006: the MacBook Pro and a new iMac, which outwardly looked identical to the iMac G5. Within nine months, Apple had smoothly transitioned the entire Macintosh line to Intel. The Intel-based iMac was redesigned in 2007 with an aluminum enclosure, which was gradually refined and slimmed down in the following years. In 2014, the iMac added high-resolution \"[[Retina Display|retina]]\" 4K and 5K displays, and a more powerful, professional-oriented model, the [[iMac Pro]], was introduced in 2017.\n\nApple announced a shift [[Mac transition to Apple silicon|from Intel processors to its own Apple Silicon]] in June 2020. Apple announced redesigned iMacs with a 24-inch display and [[Apple M1]] chip in April 2021. These new models harkened back to the colorful iMac G3s, coming in seven colors. The iMacs were updated in 2023 to use the [[Apple M3]] chip.<ref name=\"2023-10-31_V\">[https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938867/apple-m3-imac-macbook-pro-biggest-announcements-m3 Apple \u2018Scary Fast\u2019 Mac launch event: the 4 biggest announcements], Emma Roth, [[The Verge]], October 31, 2023</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n\nThe [[iMac G3|original iMac]] was the first [[legacy-free PC]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Spooner |first=John G. |date=December 16, 1999 |title=Compaq Hopes to Follow the iMac |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/compaq-hopes-to-follow-the-imac/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703171130/http://www.zdnet.com/news/compaq-hopes-to-follow-the-imac/104658 |archive-date=July 3, 2014 |access-date=September 19, 2014 |website=[[ZDNet]]}}</ref> It was the first Macintosh computer to have a [[USB]] port but no [[floppy disk drive]]. Subsequently, all Macs have included USB. Via the USB port, hardware makers could make products compatible with both x86 PCs and Macs. Previously, Macintosh users had to seek out certain hardware, such as keyboards and mice specifically tailored for the \"old world\" Mac's unique [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]] interface and printers and modems with [[Mini-DIN connector#8-pin|MiniDIN-8]] serial ports. Only a limited number of models from certain manufacturers were made with these interfaces and often came at a premium price. USB, being cross-platform, has allowed Macintosh users to select from a large selection of devices marketed for the [[Wintel]] PC platform, such as [[USB hub|hubs]], [[image scanner|scanners]], [[data storage device|storage devices]], [[USB flash drives]], and [[Mouse (computing)|mice]]. After the iMac, Apple continued to remove older peripheral interfaces and floppy drives from the rest of its product line.\n\nBorrowing from the 1997 [[Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh]], the various LCD-based iMac designs continued the [[All-in-one PC|all-in-one]] concept first envisioned in Apple's original Macintosh computer. The successful iMac allowed Apple to continue targeting the [[Power Macintosh]] line at the high-end of the market. This foreshadowed a similar strategy in the notebook market when the iMac-like [[iBook]] was released in 1999. Since then, the company has continued this strategy of differentiating the consumer versus professional product lines. Apple's focus on design has allowed each of its subsequent products to create a distinctive identity. Apple avoided using the beige colors that were then common in the PC industry. The company would later drift from the multicolored designs of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The latter part of the decade saw Apple using [[Anodizing|anodized]] aluminum; glass; and white, black, and clear [[polycarbonate]] plastics among its build materials. Today many PCs are more design-conscious than before the iMac's introduction, with multi-shaded design schemes being common, and some desktops and laptops available in colorful, decorative patterns.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 15, 2008 |title=Eight ways the iMac changed computing |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/135017/2008/08/imacanniversary.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222091746/http://www.macworld.com/article/135017/2008/08/imacanniversary.html |archive-date=December 22, 2011 |access-date=August 27, 2008 |website=[[Macworld]]}}</ref>\n\nApple's use of translucent, candy-colored plastics inspired similar [[industrial design]]s in other consumer products.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Edwards |first=Benj |date=September 15, 2008 |title=10 Years of Cuddly, Friendly iMacs |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/09/gallery-imac-anniversary/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220092946/https://www.wired.com/2008/09/gallery-imac-anniversary/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016 |access-date=December 10, 2016 |magazine=Wired}}</ref> Apple's later introduction of the iPod, iBook G3 (Dual USB), and iMac G4 (all featuring snowy-white plastic), inspired similar designs in other companies' consumer electronics products.

In ''The Mythical Midrange Mac Minitower'', Dan Frakes of ''Macworld'' suggests that with the iMac occupying the midrange of Apple's product line, Apple has little to offer consumers who want some ability to expand or upgrade their computers, but do not need (or cannot afford) the [[Mac Pro]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Frakes |first=Dan |title=The Mythical Midrange Mac Minitower |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/58562/2007/06/midrangemac.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911201909/http://www.macworld.com/article/58562/2007/06/midrangemac.html |archive-date=September 11, 2010 |access-date=July 6, 2011 |website=Macworld}}</ref> For example, iMac's integration of monitor and computer, while convenient, commits the owner to replace both at the same time.

Models after iMac G5 (excluding the August 7, 2007, iMac update{{According to whom|date=March 2022}}) made it difficult for the end-user to replace the hard disk or optical drive, and Apple's warranty explicitly forbids upgrading the socketed CPU. While conceding the possibility of a [[mini-tower]] cannibalizing sales from the Mac Pro, Frakes argues there is enough frustration with iMac's limitations to make such a proposition worthwhile. This disparity has become more pronounced after the G4 era since the bottom-end Power Mac G5 (with one brief exception) and Mac Pro models have all been priced in the US$1999\u20132499$ range, while base model Power Macs G4s and earlier were US$1299\u20131799.
