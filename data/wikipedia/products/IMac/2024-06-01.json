Introduced by [[Steve Jobs]] in August 1998 when the company was financially troubled, the computer was an inexpensive, consumer-oriented computer that would easily connect to the Internet. Since that time, it has remained a primary part of Apple's consumer desktop offerings and evolved through seven distinct forms.\n\nThe design of the iMac has been seen as both controversial and trendsetting. From its introduction, the computer has eschewed many entrenched legacy technologies, notably becoming an early adopter of the [[USB port]], and removing [[floppy disk]] and later [[optical disc]] drives.\n\nIn its original form, the [[iMac G3]] had a [[gumdrop]] or [[Oval#Egg shape|egg-shaped]] look, with a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitor, mainly enclosed by a colored, [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]] plastic case. The second major revision, the [[iMac G4]], moved a design with a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth revisions, the [[iMac G5]] and the [[iMac (Intel-based)|Intel iMac]], placed all the components immediately behind the display in a plastic casing, creating a slim unified design that tilts only up and down on a simple metal base. The fifth, sixth and seventh revisions swapped the plastic enclosure for metal and became progressively thinner over each revision.\n\nThe most recent revision, the [[IMac (Apple silicon)|Apple Silicon iMac]], uses Apple's own processors (silicon) and is {{Convert|11.5|mm|sp=us}} thick. Between 2017 and 2021, Apple also sold a workstation-class version of the computer called the [[iMac Pro]].\n\n== Timeline of iMac models ==\n{{Timeline of iMac models|headerextension=}}\n{{For-text|more detailed timelines|the articles for each individual generation}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n|-\n!

Opinions were divided over Apple's drastic changes to the Macintosh hardware. At the time, Apple had suffered a series of setbacks as consumers increasingly opted for [[Wintel]] (Windows PCs with Intel CPUs) machines instead of Apple's [[Performa]] models. Many in the industry thought that \"beleaguered\" Apple would soon be forced to start selling computers with a custom interface built on top of one or more potential operating system bases, such as [[Taligent]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], or [[Windows 98]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Apple Confidential: The Day They Almost Decided To Put Windows On The Mac Instead Of OS X! |url=http://macspeedzone.com/archive/art/con/be.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624175316/http://www.macspeedzone.com/archive/art/con/be.shtml |archive-date=June 24, 2013 |access-date=March 11, 2015 |quote=Hancock ordered her staff to consider Microsoft's Windows, Sun Microsystems' Solaris, and even the ill-fated Taligent, which Apple had handed off to partner IBM in December 1995.

Apple announced at the [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] that it would be [[Mac transition to Intel processors|switching the Macintosh to the x86 architecture]] and Intel's line of Core processors. The first Intel-equipped Macs were unveiled on January 10, 2006: the Intel iMac and the introductory MacBook Pro. Within nine months, Apple had smoothly transitioned the entire Macintosh line to Intel. One of the highly touted side benefits of this switch was the ability to run Windows on Mac hardware. \n\nOn July 27, 2010, Apple updated its line of iMacs to feature the new Intel Core \"i-series\" processors across the line. The 21.5\" models now feature the [[Intel Core i3|Core i3]] processor, but these are upgradable to the Core i5. The high-end 27\" features a [[Intel Core i5|Quad-Core i5]] processor, which is upgradable to a [[Intel Core i7|Quad-Core i7]]. On this date, Apple also announced its new \"[[Apple Magic Trackpad]]\" peripheral, a trackpad similar to that of the MacBook Pro for use with iMac or any other Apple computer. Apple also introduced a AA NiMH battery charger intended to simplify the use of batteries in these peripherals. Apple offers an option to use a solid-state drive instead of a large mechanical drive.\n\nOn May 3, 2011, Apple updated its iMac line with the introduction of Intel [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] technology and Intel Core [[Intel Core i5|i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] [[Sandy Bridge]] processors as well as a 1 mega pixel [[high definition video|high definition]] [[iSight|FaceTime]] camera, features which were first introduced in the [[MacBook Pro]] line in February 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 3, 2011 |title=Apple Announces New iMac With Next Generation Quad-Core Processors, Graphics & Thunderbolt I/O Technology |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/05/03imac.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623030009/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/05/03imac.html |archive-date=June 23, 2011 |access-date=July 6, 2011 |publisher=Apple}}</ref>\n\nOn October 23, 2012, a new iMac was announced (for a November/December release) with a substantially thinner edge, new Apple [[Fusion Drive]], faster processors (Intel Core [[Intel Core i5|i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]]) and graphics along with updates to the ports, but with the same overall depth (stand depth: 8 inches (20.3&nbsp; cm)). To reduce the edge, the [[SuperDrive]] was removed on these iMacs.\n\nOn October 16, 2014, a new version of the 27-inch (69&nbsp; cm) iMac was announced, whose main feature is a \"[[Retina Display|Retina 5K]]\" display at a resolution of 5120 \u00d7 2880 pixels.<ref name=\"Retina5KPixels\">{{Cite web |title=Apple \u2013 iMac with Retina 5K display \u2013 Features |url=https://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/features/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224121738/https://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/features/ |archive-date=February 24, 2015 |access-date=February 24, 2015 |publisher=Apple Inc}}</ref> The new model also includes a new [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|processor]], [[AMD Radeon Rx 200 Series|graphics chip]], and [[Input/output|I/O]], along with several new [[Computer data storage|storage]] options.

For the first time, the iMac can support 6-core or 8-core Intel processors. Apple claims the 21.5-inch model is up to 60% faster than the previous model, and the 27-inch is up to 2.4 times faster. The exterior of the machine remained the same as the previous model.\n\nOn August 4, 2020, Apple refreshed the iMac models. The smaller 21.5-inch model was updated with SSDs standard. The 27-inch model received 10th generation Intel chips, a T2 Security chip, a 1080p camera, studio-quality microphone, an option for nano-textured glass, as well as SSDs standard.

Subsequently, all Macs have included USB. Via the USB port, hardware makers could make products compatible with both x86 PCs and Macs. Previously, Macintosh users had to seek out certain hardware, such as keyboards and mice specifically tailored for the \"old world\" Mac's unique [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]] interface and printers and modems with [[Mini-DIN connector#8-pin|MiniDIN-8]] serial ports. Only a limited number of models from certain manufacturers were made with these interfaces and often came at a premium price. USB, being cross-platform, has allowed Macintosh users to select from a large selection of devices marketed for the [[Wintel]] PC platform, such as [[USB hub|hubs]], [[image scanner|scanners]], [[data storage device|storage devices]], [[USB flash drives]], and [[Mouse (computing)|mice]]. After the iMac, Apple continued to remove older peripheral interfaces and floppy drives from the rest of its product line.\n\nBorrowing from the 1997 [[Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh]], the various LCD-based iMac designs continued the [[All-in-one PC|all-in-one]] concept first envisioned in Apple's original Macintosh computer. The successful iMac allowed Apple to continue targeting the [[Power Macintosh]] line at the high-end of the market. This foreshadowed a similar strategy in the notebook market when the iMac-like [[iBook]] was released in 1999. Since then, the company has continued this strategy of differentiating the consumer versus professional product lines. Apple's focus on design has allowed each of its subsequent products to create a distinctive identity. Apple avoided using the beige colors that were then common in the PC industry. The company would later drift from the multicolored designs of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The latter part of the decade saw Apple using [[Anodizing|anodized]] aluminum; glass; and white, black, and clear [[polycarbonate]] plastics among their build materials. Today many PCs are more design-conscious than before the iMac's introduction, with multi-shaded design schemes being common, and some desktops and laptops available in colorful, decorative patterns.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 15, 2008 |title=Eight ways the iMac changed computing |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/135017/2008/08/imacanniversary.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222091746/http://www.macworld.com/article/135017/2008/08/imacanniversary.html |archive-date=December 22, 2011 |access-date=August 27, 2008 |website=[[Macworld]]}}</ref>\n\nApple's use of translucent, candy-colored plastics inspired similar [[industrial design]]s in other consumer products.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Edwards |first=Benj |date=September 15, 2008 |title=10 Years of Cuddly, Friendly iMacs |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/09/gallery-imac-anniversary/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220092946/https://www.wired.com/2008/09/gallery-imac-anniversary/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016 |access-date=December 10, 2016 |magazine=Wired}}</ref> Apple's later introduction of the iPod, iBook G3 (Dual USB), and iMac G4 (all featuring snowy-white plastic), inspired similar designs in other companies' consumer electronics products.

In ''The Mythical Midrange Mac Minitower'', Dan Frakes of ''Macworld'' suggests that with the iMac occupying the midrange of Apple's product line, Apple has little to offer consumers who want some ability to expand or upgrade their computers, but do not need (or cannot afford) the [[Mac Pro]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Frakes |first=Dan |title=The Mythical Midrange Mac Minitower |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/58562/2007/06/midrangemac.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911201909/http://www.macworld.com/article/58562/2007/06/midrangemac.html |archive-date=September 11, 2010 |access-date=July 6, 2011 |website=Macworld}}</ref> For example, iMac's integration of monitor and computer, while convenient, commits the owner to replace both at the same time.

Models after iMac G5 (excluding the August 7, 2007, iMac update{{According to whom|date=March 2022}}) made it difficult for the end-user to replace the hard disk or optical drive, and Apple's warranty explicitly forbids upgrading the socketed CPU. While conceding the possibility of a [[mini-tower]] cannibalizing sales from the Mac Pro, Frakes argues there is enough frustration with iMac's limitations to make such a proposition worthwhile. This disparity has become more pronounced after the G4 era since the bottom-end Power Mac G5 (with one brief exception) and Mac Pro models have all been priced in the US$1999\u20132499$ range, while base model Power Macs G4s and earlier were US$1299\u20131799.
