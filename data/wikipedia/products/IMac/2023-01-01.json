The second major revision, the [[iMac G4]], moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth major revisions, the [[iMac G5]] and the [[iMac (Intel-based)|Intel iMac]] respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only up and down on a simple metal base.\n\nThe fifth major revision (mid-2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was thinner and used [[anodized aluminum]] and a glass panel over the entire front. The seventh major revision (late 2012) uses a different display unit, omits the [[SuperDrive]], and uses different production techniques from the older unibody versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older models, with an edge thickness of 5.9&nbsp; mm (but the same maximum depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup and includes [[solid-state drive]] (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple [[Fusion Drive]], a hybrid of solid-state and hard disk drives.

Opinions were divided over Apple's drastic changes to the Macintosh hardware. At the time, Apple had suffered a series of setbacks as consumers increasingly opted for [[Wintel]] (Windows PCs with Intel CPUs) machines instead of Apple's [[Performa]] models. Many in the industry thought that \"beleaguered\" Apple would soon be forced to start selling computers with a custom interface built on top of one or more potential operating system bases, such as [[Taligent]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], or [[Windows 98]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macspeedzone.com/archive/art/con/be.shtml|title=Apple Confidential: The Day They Almost Decided To Put Windows On The Mac Instead Of OS X!|quote=Hancock ordered her staff to consider Microsoft's Windows, Sun Microsystems' Solaris, and even the ill-fated Taligent, which Apple had handed off to partner IBM in December 1995.

Apple announced at the [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] that it would be [[Mac transition to Intel processors|switching the Macintosh to the x86 architecture]] and Intel's line of Core processors. The first Intel-equipped Macs were unveiled on January 10, 2006: the Intel iMac and the introductory MacBook Pro. Within nine months, Apple had smoothly transitioned the entire Macintosh line to Intel. One of the highly touted side benefits of this switch was the ability to run Windows on Mac hardware. [[File:Timeline of the product Apple iMac.svg|thumb|600x600px|The timeline of iMac from 1998 to 2021, comparing it with the original [[Macintosh 128K]] (1984). This chart shows the change in the physical characteristics and appearance of the product.]]\n\nOn July 27, 2010, Apple updated its line of iMacs to feature the new Intel Core \"i-series\" processors across the line. The 21.5\" models now feature the [[Intel Core i3|Core i3]] processor, but these are upgradable to the Core i5. The high-end 27\" features a [[Intel Core i5|Quad-Core i5]] processor, which is upgradable to a [[Intel Core i7|Quad-Core i7]]. On this date, Apple also announced its new \"[[Apple Magic Trackpad]]\" peripheral, a trackpad similar to that of the MacBook Pro for use with iMac or any other Apple computer. Apple also introduced a AA NiMH battery charger intended to simplify the use of batteries in these peripherals. Apple offers an option to use a solid-state drive instead of a large mechanical drive.\n\nOn May 3, 2011, Apple updated its iMac line with the introduction of Intel [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] technology and Intel Core [[Intel Core i5|i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] [[Sandy Bridge]] processors as well as a 1 mega pixel [[high definition video|high definition]] [[iSight|FaceTime]] camera, features which were first introduced in the [[MacBook Pro]] line in February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/05/03imac.html |title=Apple Announces New iMac With Next Generation Quad-Core Processors, Graphics & Thunderbolt I/O Technology |publisher=Apple |date=May 3, 2011 |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn October 23, 2012, a new iMac was announced (for a November/December release) with a substantially thinner edge, new Apple [[Fusion Drive]], faster processors (Intel Core [[Intel Core i5|i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]]) and graphics along with updates to the ports, but with the same overall depth (stand depth: 8 inches (20.3&nbsp; cm)). To reduce the edge, the [[SuperDrive]] was removed on these iMacs.\n\nOn October 16, 2014, a new version of the 27-inch (69&nbsp; cm) iMac was announced, whose main feature is a \"[[Retina Display|Retina 5K]]\" display at a resolution of 5120 \u00d7 2880 pixels.<ref name=Retina5KPixels>{{cite web|title=Apple \u2013 iMac with Retina 5K display \u2013 Features|url=https://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/features/|publisher=Apple Inc |access-date=24 February 2015}}</ref> The new model also includes a new [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|processor]], [[AMD Radeon Rx 200 Series|graphics chip]], and [[Input/output|I/O]], along with several new [[Computer data storage|storage]] options. This computer was designed with professional photographers and video editors in mind, with the 5K resolution allowing 4K video to be played at its native resolution in Final Cut Pro, with room for toolbars on the side.\n\nOn June 6, 2017, Apple\u2019s 21.5-inch iMac, which has a \"Retina 4K\" display at a resolution of 4096\u2009\u00d7\u20092304 pixels, and the latest Intel 7th generation i5 processor, was announced. The iMac has Turbo Boost up to 3.6 GHz supported, and a 1&nbsp;TB hard drive. Apple\u2019s iMac with 4K display has Intel Core i5 quad-core processor with 3&nbsp;GHz or 3.4 GHz clock speed. The RAM on board is 8&nbsp;GB, and it will support a Turbo boost of up to 3.8 GHz. This iMac has options of 1&nbsp;TB hard drive or 1&nbsp;TB Fusion Drive. This 21.5-inch iMac also has the option of Radeon Pro 555 with 2&nbsp;GB of video RAM for graphics or a Radeon Pro 560 with 4&nbsp;GB of video RAM. Apple\u2019s 27-inch iMac with the 5K display comes with the quad-core Intel Core i5 processor, which is clocked at 3.4 GHz, 3.5 GHz, or 3.8 GHz.

Unlike most other Apple releases, Apple opted not to announce the iMac at an event; instead, they updated the specs and released a press statement. For the first time, the iMac can support 6-core or 8-core Intel processors. Apple claims the 21.5-inch model is up to 60% faster than the previous model, and the 27-inch is up to 2.4 times faster. The exterior of the machine remained the same as the previous model.\n\nOn August 4, 2020, Apple refreshed the iMac models. The smaller 21.5-inch model was updated with SSDs standard. The 27-inch model received 10th generation Intel chips, a T2 Security chip, a 1080p camera, studio-quality microphone, an option for nano-textured glass, as well as SSDs standard. The 27-inch model now has SSDs soldered to the motherboard, which means the storage is no longer replaceable, and in order to replace a hard drive the entire motherboard must be replaced and any data on the drive will be wiped.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-05|title=iMac 27 \"2020: SSDs arrive soldered|url=https://www.world-today-news.com/imac-27-2020-ssds-arrive-soldered/|access-date=2020-09-09|website=World Today News|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn April 20, 2021, Apple announced redesigned iMacs with a 24-inch display, new colors (7), updated cameras, and the inclusion of the [[Apple M1]] chip.\n\n== Influence ==\n\nThe [[iMac G3|original iMac]] was the first [[legacy-free PC]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Compaq Hopes to Follow the iMac|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/compaq-hopes-to-follow-the-imac/104658|first=John G.|last=Spooner|date=December 16, 1999|work=[[ZDNet]]}}</ref> It was the first Macintosh computer to have a [[USB]] port but no [[floppy disk drive]]. Subsequently, all Macs have included USB. Via the USB port, hardware makers could make products compatible with both x86 PCs and Macs. Previously, Macintosh users had to seek out certain hardware, such as keyboards and mice specifically tailored for the \"old world\" Mac's unique [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]] interface and printers and modems with [[Mini-DIN connector#8-pin|MiniDIN-8]] serial ports. Only a limited number of models from certain manufacturers were made with these interfaces and often came at a premium price. USB, being cross-platform, has allowed Macintosh users to select from a large selection of devices marketed for the [[Wintel]] PC platform, such as [[USB hub|hubs]], [[image scanner|scanners]], [[data storage device|storage devices]], [[USB flash drives]], and [[Mouse (computing)|mice]]. After the iMac, Apple continued to remove older peripheral interfaces and floppy drives from the rest of its product line.\n\nBorrowing from the 1997 [[Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh]], the various LCD-based iMac designs continued the [[All-in-one PC|all-in-one]] concept first envisioned in Apple's original Macintosh computer. The successful iMac allowed Apple to continue targeting the [[Power Macintosh]] line at the high-end of the market. This foreshadowed a similar strategy in the notebook market when the iMac-like [[iBook]] was released in 1999. Since then, the company has continued this strategy of differentiating the consumer versus professional product lines. Apple's focus on design has allowed each of its subsequent products to create a distinctive identity. Apple avoided using the beige colors that were then common in the PC industry. The company would later drift from the multicolored designs of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The latter part of the decade saw Apple using [[Anodizing|anodized]] aluminum; glass; and white, black, and clear [[polycarbonate]] plastics among their build materials. Today many PCs are more design-conscious than before the iMac's introduction, with multi-shaded design schemes being common, and some desktops and laptops available in colorful, decorative patterns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/135017/2008/08/imacanniversary.html |title=Eight ways the iMac changed computing |access-date=August 27, 2008 |work=[[Macworld]] |date=August 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nApple's use of translucent, candy-colored plastics inspired similar [[industrial design]]s in other consumer products.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/09/gallery-imac-anniversary/ |title=10 Years of Cuddly, Friendly iMacs |magazine=Wired |first=Benj |last=Edwards |date=September 15, 2008}}</ref> Apple's later introduction of the iPod, iBook G3 (Dual USB), and iMac G4 (all featuring snowy-white plastic), inspired similar designs in other companies' consumer electronics products.

While conceding the possibility of a [[mini-tower]] cannibalizing sales from the Mac Pro, Frakes argues there is enough frustration with iMac's limitations to make such a proposition worthwhile. This disparity has become more pronounced after the G4 era since the bottom-end Power Mac G5 (with one brief exception) and Mac Pro models have all been priced in the US$1999\u20132499$ range, while base model Power Macs G4s and earlier were US$1299\u20131799. The current generation iMac has Intel 5th generation i5 and i7 processors, ranging from quad-core 2.7 GHz i5 to a quad-core 3.4 GHz i7 processor,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/imac/specs/ |title=iMac Technical Specifications |date=December 10, 2012}}</ref> however it is possible to upgrade the 2010 edition of the iMac quite easily.<ref>{{cite
