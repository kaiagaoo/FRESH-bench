Released on February 25, 2022, the Steam Deck can be played as a handheld or connected to a monitor in the same manner as the [[Nintendo Switch]]. It is an [[x86-64#Microarchitecture levels|x86-64-v3]] device running [[SteamOS]], with integrated gaming inputs designed to play the full [[Steam (service)|Steam]] library, including [[Windows]] PC games via the [[Linux]]-based [[Proton (software)|Proton]] [[compatibility layer]]. The system is an open platform, allowing users to install compatible non-Steam games or [[operating system]]s on the device.\n\n==History==\nValve's first foray into hardware was with the [[Steam Machine (hardware platform)|Steam Machine]], a computer specification based on the [[Linux]]-derived [[SteamOS]] that could be adopted by any computer manufacturer to make systems optimized for running Steam and games from it. Introduced in 2015, the platform did not sell well and Valve quietly pulled back on it by April 2018, but stated they remained committed to providing some type of open-hardware platform.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-04-its-true-steam-machines-arent-exactly-flying-off-the-shelves | title = \"It's true Steam Machines aren't exactly flying off the shelves\" | first = Tom | last= Phillips | date = April 4, 2018 | access-date = April 4, 2018 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> Steam Deck designer Scott Dalton said \"there was always kind of this classic [[chicken and egg problem]] with the Steam Machine\", as it required the adoption of Linux by both gamers and game developers to reach a critical interest in the machines to draw manufacturers in making them.<ref name=\"ign steam machines\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-valve-explains-how-it-learned-from-past-mistakes | title = Valve Explains How The Failure of Steam Machines Helped Build The Steam Deck | first= Tom | last = Marks | date = July 30, 2021 | accessdate = July 30, 2021 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> The lack of Linux game availability during the lifetime of Steam Machines led Valve to invest development into Proton, a Linux-based compatibility layer to allow most Windows\u2013based applications and games to be run on Linux without modification.<ref name=\"ign steam machines\"/>\n\nOther factors from the Steam Machine line worked their way into the conception of the Steam Deck. The [[Steam Controller]] was developed by Valve as part of the Steam Machine line. Some of the early prototypes of the controller included a small LCD screen within the middle of the controller which could be programmed as a second screen alongside the game that the user was playing. One idea from this prototype was to include the [[Steam Link]], a hardware device capable of streaming game content from a computer running Steam to a different monitor, here routing that output to the small LCD on the controller. This was later considered by Valve a very early concept behind the Steam Deck.<ref name=\"ign steam machines\"/> Further, their experience with trying to convince other manufacturers to produce Steam Machines led Valve to realize that it was better to develop all their hardware internally. Dalton said, \"More and more it just became kind of clear, the more of this we are doing internally, the more we can kind of make a complete package.\"<ref name=\"ign steam machines\"/>\n\nRumors that Valve was working on a portable gaming unit had emerged in May 2021, based on updates made within the Steam code pointing towards a new \"SteamPal\" device, and comments made by Gabe Newell related to Valve developing games for consoles. ''[[Ars Technica]]'' had been able to confirm that new hardware was in development at Valve.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/exclusive-valve-is-making-a-switch-like-portable-gaming-pc/ | title = Exclusive: Valve is making a Switch-like portable gaming PC | first=  Sam | last=  Mackovech | date = May 25, 2021 | accessdate = July 15, 2021 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref>\n\nValve revealed the Steam Deck on July 15, 2021.
