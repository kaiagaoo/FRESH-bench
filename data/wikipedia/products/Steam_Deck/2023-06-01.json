The device uses Valve's [[Linux distribution]] [[SteamOS]], which incorporates the namesake [[Steam (service)|Steam]] storefront. SteamOS uses Valve's [[Proton (software)|Proton]] [[compatibility layer]], allowing users to run [[Windows]] applications and games. In addition to handheld use, the Steam Deck can be connected to a [[TV]] or [[computer monitor|monitor]] through a [[docking station]] and be used like a [[desktop computer]] or [[home video game console]]. In desktop mode, users are allowed to install [[Linux]]-based third-party applications.\n\n==History==\nValve's [[Steam Machine (hardware platform)|Steam Machine]] series of gaming computers using [[Linux]]-derived [[SteamOS]] was introduced in 2015, which worked their way into the conception of the Steam Deck. Valve quietly pulled back on it by April 2018, but stated they remained committed to providing some type of open-hardware platform.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Phillips |first=Tom |date=April 4, 2018 |title='It's true Steam Machines aren't exactly flying off the shelves' |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-04-its-true-steam-machines-arent-exactly-flying-off-the-shelves |access-date=April 4, 2018 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> Steam Deck designer Scott Dalton said \"there was always kind of this classic [[chicken and egg problem]] with the Steam Machine\", as it required the adoption of Linux by both gamers and game developers to reach a critical interest in the machines to draw manufacturers in making them.<ref name=\"ign steam machines\">{{Cite web |last=Marks |first=Tom |date=July 30, 2021 |title=Valve Explains How The Failure of Steam Machines Helped Build The Steam Deck |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-valve-explains-how-it-learned-from-past-mistakes |access-date=July 30, 2021 |website=[[IGN]]}}</ref> The lack of Linux game availability during the lifetime of Steam Machines led Valve to invest development into [[Proton (software)|Proton]], a Linux compatibility layer to allow Windows\u2013based games to be run on Linux without modification.<ref name=\"ign steam machines\" /> Some of the early prototypes of Valve's [[Steam Controller]], also released in 2015, included a small LCD screen within the middle of the controller which could be programmed as a second screen alongside the game that the user was playing. One idea from this prototype was to include the [[Steam Link]], a device capable of streaming game content from a computer running Steam to a different monitor, here routing that output to the small LCD on the controller. This was later considered by Valve a very early concept behind the Steam Deck.<ref name=\"ign steam machines\" /> Further, their experience with trying to convince other manufacturers to produce Steam Machines led Valve to realize that it was better to develop all their hardware internally. Dalton said, \"More and more it just became kind of clear, the more of this we are doing internally, the more we can kind of make a complete package.\"<ref name=\"ign steam machines\" /> Rumors that Valve was working on a portable gaming unit had emerged in May 2021, based on updates made within the Steam code pointing towards a new \"SteamPal\" device, and comments made by Gabe Newell related to Valve developing games for consoles.
