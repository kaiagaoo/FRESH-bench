The 48-volt system reduces 84% of wiring harness mass for high-powered loads<ref name=\"Munro Live 2023\"/>{{rp|16:15}} at the expense of thicker insulation and fitting more DC-to-DC converters distributed in the ECUs to supply other voltages where needed, most of them with small power demand. The overall increase in vehicle power demand due to many more electrical loads are better served by the 48-volt system.  \n\nIn order to accelerate the adoption by other automakers of a 48&nbsp;V system voltage for automobiles, Tesla offered a \"48-volt electrical system whitepaper to all industry leaders. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] CEO [[Jim Farley (businessman)|Jim Farley]] confirmed it got a copy and agreed to 'help the supply base move into the 48-volt future.'\" Tesla plans to migrate over time more of its low-voltage components with high power draw to 48&nbsp;V in upcoming vehicle models, as well as the [[Optimus (robot)|Optimus robot]].<ref name=\"autoev20231215\">{{Cite news |date=December 10, 2023 |title=5 Tesla Cybertruck Features That Didn't Make It Into Production and Five No One Saw Coming |work=AutoEvolution |url=https://www.autoevolution.com/news/5-tesla-cybertruck-features-that-didn-t-make-it-into-production-and-five-no-one-saw-coming-225831.html |access-date=December 15, 2023 |archive-date=December 15, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231215201237/https://www.autoevolution.com/news/5-tesla-cybertruck-features-that-didn-t-make-it-into-production-and-five-no-one-saw-coming-225831.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"inevs20230311\">{{Cite news |date=March 11, 2023 |title=Tesla Confirms The Switch To 48 Volt System |work=InsideEVs |url=https://insideevs.com/news/656775/tesla-switch-48v-voltage-system/ |access-date=December 21, 2023 |archive-date=December 11, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231211212253/https://insideevs.com/news/656775/tesla-switch-48v-voltage-system/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Control and feedback ===\n\nTesla is using [[Etherloop]], a [[gigabit Ethernet]] 2-wire loop, bi-directional physical network\u2014with a proprietary [[Time slicing (digital broadcasting)|time-sliced]], [[network protocol]]\u2014for [[near real-time]] control and [[feedback]] in Cybertruck. The wire loop is used for all motor vehicle subsystems, including [[steer-by-wire]], motor controls, all [[Controller Area Network|vehicle controllers]], plus [[vehicle audio]] with [[Active noise control|active road-noise cancellation]]. Tesla can obtain millisecond-scale latency with microsecond-scale synchronizaton, plus redundant control, since if one path is broken or defective, the data is moving bi-directionally over the physical loop and can be routed over the alternate path. The transition to an Etherloop vehicle architecture has dramatically reduced the total amount of wiring going across the vehicle by 68 percent (from 490 to 155 wires) even though the number of endpoints increased 35 percent (from 273 to 368 endpoints) compared with Tesla's previous newest vehicle, the [[Tesla Model Y|Model Y]]. Average wire length is also much shorter, while total bandwidth is ~200x the traditional 500 kb/s data rate of traditional vehicle controllers. Moving to the Etherloop architecture resulted in significant cost savings per vehicle built while increasing reliability and enhancing debug & service capabilities.<ref name=trati20231211>{{cite news |title=Tesla executives detail Cybertruck 'Etherloop' wiring system |url=https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-executives-cybertruck-etherloop-wiring/ |work=Teslarati |date=11 December 2023 |access-date=28 December 2023 |archive-date=28 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231228192743/https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-executives-cybertruck-etherloop-wiring/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Munro Live 2023\"/>{{rp|13:20\u201320:51}}\n\n=== Cargo bed ===\n[[File:Tesla Cybertruck unveiling.jpg|thumb|right|Rear view, 2019 prototype]]\nThe cargo bed is {{cvt|72|in}} long and {{cvt|48|in}} wide.
