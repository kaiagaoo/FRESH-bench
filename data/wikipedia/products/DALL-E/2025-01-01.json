In the following year, its successor DALL-E 2 was released. DALL-E 3 was released natively into [[ChatGPT]] for ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise customers in October 2023,<ref name=\"David-2023\" /> with availability via OpenAI's API<ref name=\"platform.openai.com\" /> and \"Labs\" platform provided in early November.<ref name=\"Niles-2023\" /> Microsoft implemented the model in Bing's Image Creator tool and plans to implement it into their Designer app.<ref name=\"Mehdi-2023\" />\n\n== History and background ==\nDALL-E was revealed by OpenAI in a blog post on 5 January 2021, and uses a version of [[GPT-3]]<ref name=\"vb\" /> modified to generate images.\n\nOn 6 April 2022, OpenAI announced DALL-E 2, a successor designed to generate more realistic images at higher resolutions that \"can combine concepts, attributes, and styles\".<ref name=\"OpenAI-2\" /> On 20 July 2022, DALL-E 2 entered into a beta phase with invitations sent to 1 million waitlisted individuals;<ref name=\"OpenAI-2022b\" /> users could generate a certain number of images for free every month and may purchase more.<ref name=\"Allyn-2022\" /> Access had previously been restricted to pre-selected users for a research preview due to concerns about [[Ethics of artificial intelligence|ethics]] and safety.<ref name=\"labs.openai.com\" /><ref name=\"Guardian-2022\" /> On 28 September 2022, DALL-E 2 was opened to everyone and the waitlist requirement was removed.<ref name=\"OpenAI-2022c\" /> In September 2023, OpenAI announced their latest image model, DALL-E 3, capable of understanding \"significantly more nuance and detail\" than previous iterations.<ref name=\"OpenAI\" /> In early November 2022, OpenAI released DALL-E 2 as an [[API]], allowing developers to integrate the model into their own applications. [[Microsoft]] unveiled their implementation of DALL-E 2 in their Designer app and Image Creator tool included in [[Microsoft Bing|Bing]] and [[Microsoft Edge]].<ref name=\"OpenAI-2022d\" /> The API operates on a cost-per-image basis, with prices varying depending on image resolution. Volume discounts are available to companies working with OpenAI's enterprise team.<ref name=\"Wiggers-2022\" />\n\nThe software's name is a [[portmanteau]] of the names of animated robot [[Pixar]] character [[WALL-E (character)|WALL-E]] and the Catalan surrealist artist [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]].<ref name=\"tc\" /><ref name=\"vb\" />\n\nIn February 2024, OpenAI began adding watermarks to DALL-E generated images, containing metadata in the C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) standard promoted by the [[Content Authenticity Initiative]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Growcoot |first=Matt |date=2024-02-08 |title=AI Images Generated on DALL-E Now Contain the Content Authenticity Tag |url=https://petapixel.com/2024/02/08/ai-images-generated-on-dall-e-now-contain-the-content-authenticity-tag/ |access-date=2024-04-04 |website=[[PetaPixel]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Technology ==\nThe first [[generative pre-trained transformer]] (GPT) model was initially developed by OpenAI in 2018,<ref name=\"Radford-2018\" /> using a [[Transformer (machine learning model)|Transformer]] architecture. The first iteration, GPT-1,<ref name=\"GPT-2023\" /> was scaled up to produce [[GPT-2]] in 2019;<ref name=\"Radford-2019\" /> in 2020, it was scaled up again to produce [[GPT-3]], with 175 billion parameters.<ref name=\"Brown-2020\" /><ref name=\"vb\" /><ref name=\"dallepaper\" />\n\n=== DALL-E ===\nDALL-E has three components: a discrete [[Variational autoencoder|VAE]], an autoregressive decoder-only Transformer (12 billion parameters) similar to GPT-3, and a CLIP pair of image encoder and text encoder.<ref name=\"Ramesh-2022\" />\n\nThe discrete VAE can convert an image to a sequence of tokens, and conversely, convert a sequence of tokens back to an image. This is necessary as the Transformer does not directly process image data.<ref name=\"Ramesh-2022\" />\n\nThe input to the Transformer model is a sequence of tokenized image caption followed by tokenized image patches. The image caption is in English, tokenized by [[byte pair encoding]] (vocabulary size 16384), and can be up to 256 tokens long. Each image is a 256\u00d7256 RGB image, divided into 32\u00d732 patches of 4\u00d74 each. Each patch is then converted by a discrete [[variational autoencoder]] to a token (vocabulary size 8192).<ref name=\"Ramesh-2022\" />\n\nDALL-E was developed and announced to the public in conjunction with [[Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training|CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)]].<ref name=\"Heaven-2021\" /> CLIP is a separate model based on [[contrastive learning]] that was trained on 400 million pairs of images with text captions [[Web scraping|scraped]] from the Internet. Its role is to \"understand and rank\" DALL-E's output by predicting which caption from a list of 32,768 captions randomly selected from the dataset (of which one was the correct answer) is most appropriate for an image.<ref>{{Cite conference |last1=Radford |first1=Alec |last2=Kim |first2=Jong Wook |last3=Hallacy |first3=Chris |last4=Ramesh |first4=Aditya |last5=Goh |first5=Gabriel |last6=Agarwal |first6=Sandhini |last7=Sastry |first7=Girish |last8=Askell |first8=Amanda |last9=Mishkin |first9=Pamela |display-authors=3 |date=2021-07-01 |title=Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision |url=https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/radford21a |conference=Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning |language=en |publisher=PMLR |pages=8748\u20138763 |last10=Clark |first10=Jack |last11=Krueger |first11=Gretchen |last12=Sutskever |first12=Ilya}}</ref>\n\nA trained CLIP pair is used to filter a larger initial list of images generated by DALL-E to select the image that is closest to the text prompt.<ref name=\"Ramesh-2022\" />\n\n=== DALL-E 2 ===\nDALL-E 2 uses 3.5 billion parameters, a smaller number than its predecessor.<ref name=\"Ramesh-2022\" /> Instead of an autoregressive Transformer, DALL-E 2 uses a [[diffusion model]] conditioned on CLIP image embeddings, which, during inference, are generated from CLIP text embeddings by a prior model.<ref name=\"Ramesh-2022\" /> This is the same architecture as that of [[Stable Diffusion]], released a few months later.\n\n== Capabilities ==\nDALL-E can generate imagery in multiple styles, including [[photorealistic]] imagery, [[paintings]], and [[emoji]].<ref name=\"vb\" /> It can \"manipulate and rearrange\" objects in its images,<ref name=\"vb\" /> and can correctly place design elements in novel compositions without explicit instruction. Thom Dunn writing for ''[[Boing Boing|BoingBoing]]'' remarked that \"For example, when asked to draw a daikon radish blowing its nose, sipping a latte, or riding a unicycle, DALL-E often draws the handkerchief, hands, and feet in plausible locations.\"<ref name=\"boing\" /> DALL-E showed the ability to \"fill in the blanks\" to infer appropriate details without specific prompts, such as adding Christmas imagery to prompts commonly associated with the celebration,<ref name=\"extreme\" /> and appropriately placed shadows to images that did not mention them.<ref name=\"engadget\" /> Furthermore, DALL-E exhibits a broad understanding of visual and design trends.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\nDALL-E can produce images for a wide variety of arbitrary descriptions from various viewpoints<ref name=\"Marcus-2022\" /> with only rare failures.<ref name=\"tc\" /> Mark Riedl, an associate professor at the [[Georgia Tech]] School of Interactive Computing, found that DALL-E could blend concepts (described as a key element of human [[creativity]]).<ref name=\"cnbc\" /><ref name=\"bbc\" />\n\nIts visual reasoning ability is sufficient to solve [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's Matrices]] (visual tests often administered to humans to measure intelligence).<ref name=\"dale\" /><ref name=\"OpenAI-2021\" />\n\n[[File:DALL-E 3 AI image of an avocado speaking.png|thumb|An image of accurate text generated by DALL-E 3 based on the text prompt \"An illustration of an avocado sitting in a therapist's chair, saying 'I just feel so empty inside' with a pit-sized hole in its center. The therapist, a spoon, scribbles notes\"]]\nDALL-E 3 follows complex prompts with more accuracy and detail than its predecessors, and is able to generate more coherent and accurate text.<ref name=\"Edwards-2023\" /><ref name=\"OpenAI\" /> DALL-E 3 is integrated into ChatGPT Plus.<ref name=\"OpenAI\" />\n\n=== Image modification ===\n{{multiple image\n| align             = \n| width             = 130\n| image1            = DALL-E 2 variation 1.png\n| image2            = DALL-E 2 variation 2.png\n| footer            = Two \"variations\" of ''[[Girl With a Pearl Earring]]'' generated with DALL-E 2\n}}\nGiven an existing image, DALL-E 2 can produce \"variations\" of the image as individual outputs based on the original, as well as edit the image to modify or expand upon it. DALL-E 2's \"inpainting\" and \"outpainting\" use context from an image to fill in missing areas using a [[Artistic medium|medium]] consistent with the original, following a given prompt.\n\nFor example, this can be used to insert a new subject into an image, or expand an image beyond its original borders.<ref name=\"Coldewey-2022\" /> According to OpenAI, \"Outpainting takes into account the image\u2019s existing visual elements \u2014 including shadows, reflections, and textures \u2014 to maintain the context of the original image.\"<ref name=\"OpenAI-2022\" />\n\n=== Technical limitations ===\nDALL-E 2's language understanding has limits. It is sometimes unable to distinguish \"A yellow book and a red vase\" from \"A red book and a yellow vase\" or \"A panda making latte art\" from \"Latte art of a panda\".<ref name=\"Saharia-2022\" /> It generates images of \"an astronaut riding a horse\" when presented with the prompt \"a horse riding an astronaut\".<ref name=\"Marcus-2022a\" /> It also fails to generate the correct images in a variety of circumstances. Requesting more than three objects, negation, numbers, and [[Conjunction (grammar)|connected sentences]] may result in mistakes, and object features may appear on the wrong object.<ref name=\"Marcus-2022\" /> Additional limitations include handling text \u2014 which, even with legible lettering, almost invariably results in dream-like gibberish \u2014 and its limited capacity to address scientific information, such as astronomy or medical imagery.<ref name=\"Strickland-2022\" />\n[[File:AI_tanuki_Japanese_text.jpg|thumb|An attempt to generate [[Japanese language|Japanese]] text using the prompt \"a person pointing at a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]], with a speech bubble that says '\u3053\u308c\u306f\u72f8\u3067\u3059\uff01'\", which results in the text being rendered with nonsensical [[kanji]] and [[kana]]]]\n\n== Ethical concerns ==\nDALL-E 2's reliance on public datasets influences its results and leads to [[algorithmic bias]] in some cases, such as generating higher numbers of men than women for requests that do not mention gender.<ref name=\"Strickland-2022\" /> DALL-E 2's training data was filtered to remove violent and sexual imagery, but this was found to increase bias in some cases such as reducing the frequency of women being generated.<ref name=\"OpenAI-2022a\" /> OpenAI hypothesize that this may be because women were more likely to be sexualized in training data which caused the filter to influence results.<ref name=\"OpenAI-2022a\" /> In September 2022, OpenAI confirmed to ''[[The Verge]]'' that DALL-E invisibly inserts phrases into user prompts to address bias in results; for instance, \"black man\" and \"Asian woman\" are inserted into prompts that do not specify gender or race.<ref name=\"Vincent-2022\" />\n\nA concern about DALL-E 2 and similar image generation models is that they could be used to propagate [[deepfake]]s and other forms of misinformation.<ref name=\"Taylor\" /><ref name=\"Knight-2022\" /> As an attempt to mitigate this, the software rejects prompts involving public figures and uploads containing human faces.<ref name=\"vice\" /> Prompts containing potentially objectionable content are blocked, and uploaded images are analyzed to detect offensive material.<ref name=\"docs\" /> A disadvantage of prompt-based filtering is that it is easy to bypass using alternative phrases that result in a similar output. For example, the word \"blood\" is filtered, but \"ketchup\" and \"red liquid\" are not.<ref name=\"Lane-2022\" /><ref name=\"docs\" />\n\nAnother concern about DALL-E 2 and similar models is that they could cause [[technological unemployment]] for artists, photographers, and graphic designers due to their accuracy and popularity.<ref name=\"Goldman-2022\" /><ref name=\"Blain-2022\" /> DALL-E 3 is designed to block users from generating art in the style of currently-living artists.<ref name=\"OpenAI\" />\n\nIn 2023 Microsoft pitched the [[United States Department of Defense]] to use DALL-E models to train [[battlefield management system]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Biddle |first1=Sam |title=Microsoft Pitched OpenAI's DALL-E as Battlefield Tool for U.S. Military |url=https://theintercept.com/2024/04/10/microsoft-openai-dalle-ai-military-use/ |work=The Intercept |date=10 April 2024}}</ref> In January 2024 [[OpenAI#Removal of military and warfare clause|OpenAI removed its blanket ban]] on military and warfare use from its usage policies.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Biddle |first1=Sam |title=OpenAI Quietly Deletes Ban on Using ChatGPT for \"Military and Warfare\" |url=https://theintercept.com/2024/01/12/open-ai-military-ban-chatgpt/ |work=The Intercept |date=12 January 2024}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:DALL-E radish.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Images generated by DALL-E upon the prompt: \"an illustration of a baby daikon radish in a tutu walking a dog\"]]\nMost coverage of DALL-E focuses on a small subset of \"surreal\"<ref name=\"Heaven-2021\" /> or \"quirky\"<ref name=\"cnbc\" /> outputs. DALL-E's output for \"an illustration of a baby daikon radish in a tutu walking a dog\" was mentioned in pieces from ''Input'',<ref name=\"input\" /> [[NBC]],<ref name=\"nbc\" /> ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'',<ref name=\"nature\" /> and other publications.<ref name=\"vb\" /><ref name=\"Knight-2021\" /><ref name=\"cnn\" /> Its output for \"an armchair in the shape of an avocado\" was also widely covered.<ref name=\"Heaven-2021\" /><ref name=\"bbc\" />\n\n''[[ExtremeTech]]'' stated \"you can ask DALL-E for a picture of a phone or vacuum cleaner from a specified period of time, and it understands how those objects have changed\".<ref name=\"extreme\" /> ''[[Engadget]]'' also noted its unusual capacity for \"understanding how telephones and other objects change over time\".<ref name=\"engadget\" />\n\nAccording to ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'', one of OpenAI's objectives was to \"give language models a better grasp of the everyday concepts that humans use to make sense of things\".<ref name=\"Heaven-2021\" />\n\nWall Street investors have had a positive reception of DALL-E 2, with some firms thinking it could represent a turning point for a future multi-trillion dollar industry. By mid-2019, OpenAI had already received over $1 billion in funding from [[Microsoft]] and Khosla Ventures,<ref name=\"Leswing-2022\" /><ref name=\"Etherington-2019\" /><ref name=\"Fortune\" /> and in January 2023, following the launch of DALL-E 2 and ChatGPT, received an additional $10 billion in funding from Microsoft.<ref name=\"Metz-2023\" />\n\nJapan's [[anime]] community has had a negative reaction to DALL-E 2 and similar models.<ref name=\"Rest of World-2022\" /><ref name=\"Roose-2022\" /><ref name=\"Daws-2022\" /> Two arguments are typically presented by artists against the software. The first is that AI art is not art because it is not created by a human with intent. \"The juxtaposition of AI-generated images with their own work is degrading and undermines the time and skill that goes into their art. AI-driven image generation tools have been heavily criticized by artists because they are trained on human-made art scraped from the web.\"<ref name=\"OpenAI-2022b\" /> The second is the trouble with [[copyright law]] and data text-to-image models are trained on. OpenAI has not released information about what dataset(s) were used to train DALL-E 2, inciting concern from some that the work of artists has been used for training without permission. Copyright laws surrounding these topics are inconclusive at the moment.<ref name=\"Allyn-2022\" />\n\nAfter integrating DALL-E 3 into Bing Chat and ChatGPT, Microsoft and OpenAI faced criticism for excessive content filtering, with critics saying DALL-E had been \"lobotomized.\"<ref name=\"Corden-2023\" /> The flagging of images generated by prompts such as \"man breaks server rack with sledgehammer\" was cited as evidence. Over the first days of its launch, filtering was reportedly increased to the point where images generated by some of Bing's own suggested prompts were being blocked.<ref name=\"Corden-2023\" /><ref name=\"TechRadar\" /> ''[[TechRadar]]'' argued that leaning too heavily on the side of caution could limit DALL-E's value as a creative tool.<ref name=\"TechRadar\" />\n\n== Open-source implementations ==\nSince OpenAI has not released [[source code]] for any of the three models, there have been several attempts to create [[Open source|open-source]] models offering similar capabilities.<ref name=\"Mor-2022\" /><ref name=\"Jina-2022\" /> Released in 2022 on [[Hugging Face]]'s Spaces platform, Craiyon (formerly DALL-E Mini until a name change was requested by OpenAI in June 2022) is an AI model based on the original DALL-E that was trained on unfiltered data from the Internet. It attracted substantial media attention in mid-2022, after its release due to its capacity for producing humorous imagery.<ref name=\"CNETmini\" /><ref name=\"DailyDotmini\" /><ref
