Comprising Gemini Ultra, Gemini Pro, and Gemini Nano, it was announced on December 6, 2023, positioned as a competitor to [[OpenAI]]'s [[GPT-4]]. It powers the [[chatbot]] [[Gemini (chatbot)|of the same name]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Development ===\n{{further|Gemini (chatbot)#Background}}\n{{Multiple image\n| total_width   = 270\n| caption_align = center\n| image1        = Sundar Pichai (cropped).jpg\n| caption1      = \n| image2        = Demis Hassabis Royal Society.jpg\n| caption2      = \n| footer        = [[Google]] CEO [[Sundar Pichai]] ({{abbr|L|left}}) and [[DeepMind]] CEO [[Demis Hassabis]] ({{abbr|R|right}}) spearheaded the development of Gemini.\n}}\n\n[[Google]] announced Gemini, a [[large language model]] (LLM) developed by subsidiary [[Google DeepMind]], during the [[Google I/O]] keynote on May 10, 2023. It was positioned as a more powerful successor to [[PaLM 2]], which was also unveiled at the event, with Google CEO [[Sundar Pichai]] stating that Gemini was still in its early developmental stages.<ref name=\"IO2023NYT\" /><ref name=\"IO2023ZD\" /> Unlike other LLMs, Gemini was said to be unique in that it was not trained on a [[text corpus]] alone and was designed to be [[Multimodal learning|multimodal]], meaning it could process multiple types of data simultaneously, including text, images, audio, video, and [[computer code]].<ref name=\"AnnounceGuardian\" /> It had been developed as a collaboration between DeepMind and [[Google Brain]], two branches of Google that had been merged as Google DeepMind the previous month.<ref name=\"Google25\" /> In an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', DeepMind CEO [[Demis Hassabis]] touted Gemini's advanced capabilities, which he believed would allow the algorithm to trump [[OpenAI]]'s [[ChatGPT]], which runs on [[GPT-4]] and whose growing popularity had been aggressively challenged by Google with [[LaMDA]] and [[Bard (chatbot)|Bard]]. Hassabis highlighted the strengths of DeepMind's [[AlphaGo]] program, which gained worldwide attention in 2016 when it defeated [[Go (game)|Go]] champion [[Lee Sedol]], saying that Gemini would combine the power of AlphaGo and other Google\u2013DeepMind LLMs.<ref name=\"HassabisInterview\" />\n\nIn August 2023, ''[[The Information (website)|The Information]]'' published a report outlining Google's roadmap for Gemini, revealing that the company was targeting a launch date of late 2023. According to the report, Google hoped to surpass OpenAI and other competitors by combining conversational text capabilities present in most LLMs with [[artificial intelligence]]\u2013powered image generation, allowing it to create contextual images and be adapted for a wider range of [[use cases]].<ref name=\"TheInformation\" /> Like Bard,<ref name=\"LarrySergey\" /> Google co-founder [[Sergey Brin]] was summoned out of retirement to assist in the development of Gemini, along with hundreds of other engineers from Google Brain and DeepMind;<ref name=\"TheInformation\" /><ref name=\"BrinReturn\" /> he was later credited as a \"core contributor\" to Gemini.<ref name=\"CoreContributor\" /> Because Gemini was being trained on transcripts of [[YouTube]] videos, lawyers were brought in to filter out any potentially copyrighted materials.<ref name=\"TheInformation\" />\n\nWith news of Gemini's impending launch, OpenAI hastened its work on integrating GPT-4 with multimodal features similar to those of Gemini.<ref name=\"Hustle\" /> ''The Information'' reported in September that several companies had been granted early access to \"an early version\" of the LLM, which Google intended to make available to clients through [[Google Cloud Platform|Google Cloud]]'s Vertex AI service. The publication also stated that Google was arming Gemini to compete with both GPT-4 and [[Microsoft]]'s [[GitHub Copilot]].<ref name=\"NearLaunch\" /><ref name=\"WhatWeKnow\" />\n\n=== Launch ===\nOn December 6, 2023, Pichai and Hassabis announced \"Gemini 1.0\" at a virtual press conference.<ref name=\"AnnounceWSJ\" /><ref name=\"AnnounceAP\" /> It comprised three models: Gemini Ultra, designed for \"highly complex tasks\"; Gemini Pro, designed for \"a wide range of tasks\"; and Gemini Nano, designed for \"on-device tasks\". At launch, Gemini Pro and Nano were integrated into Bard and the [[Pixel 8 Pro]] smartphone, respectively, while Gemini Ultra was set to power \"Bard Advanced\" and become available to software developers in early 2024. Other products that Google intended to incorporate Gemini into included [[Google Search|Search]], [[Google Ads|Ads]], [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], Duet AI on [[Google Workspace]], and [[AlphaCode 2]].<ref name=\"AnnounceArs\" /><ref name=\"AnnounceAP\" /> It was made available only in English.<ref name=\"AnnounceAP\" /><ref name=\"AnnounceVerge\" /> Touted as Google's \"largest and most capable AI model\" and designed to emulate human behavior,<ref name=\"AnnounceCNN\" /><ref name=\"AnnounceAP\" /><ref name=\"AnnounceCBS\" /> the company stated that Gemini would not be made widely available until the following year due to the need for \"extensive safety testing\".<ref name=\"AnnounceWSJ\" /> Gemini was trained on and powered by Google's [[Tensor Processing Unit]]s (TPUs),<ref name=\"AnnounceWSJ\" /><ref name=\"AnnounceVerge\" /> and the name is in reference to the DeepMind\u2013Google Brain merger as well as [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].<ref name=\"AnnounceWired\" />\n\nGemini Ultra was said to have outperformed GPT-4, [[Anthropic]]'s [[Claude 2]], [[Inflection AI]]'s Inflection-2, [[Meta Platforms|Meta]]'s [[LLaMA 2]], and [[xAI (company)|xAI]]'s [[Grok 1]] on a variety of industry benchmarks,<ref name=\"AnnounceTime\" /><ref name=\"AnnounceWSJ\" /> while Gemini Pro was said to have outperformed [[GPT-3.5]].<ref name=\"AnnounceGuardian\" /> Gemini Ultra was also the first language model to outperform human experts on the 57-subject [[Massive Multitask Language Understanding]] (MMLU) test, obtaining a score of 90%.<ref name=\"AnnounceGuardian\" /><ref name=\"AnnounceWired\" /> Gemini Pro was made available to Google Cloud customers on AI Studio and Vertex AI on December 13, while Gemini Nano will be made available to [[Android (operating system)|Android]] developers as well.<ref name=\"AnnounceNYT\" /><ref name=\"AnnounceCNBC\" /><ref name=\"AnnounceBloomberg\" /> Hassabis further revealed that DeepMind was exploring how Gemini could be \"combined with robotics to physically interact with the world\".<ref name=\"NewBreed\" /> In accordance with [[Executive Order 14110|an executive order]] signed by U.S. President [[Joe Biden]] in October, Google stated that it would share testing results of Gemini Ultra with the [[federal government of the United States]]. Similarly, the company was engaged in discussions with the [[government of the United Kingdom]] to comply with the principles laid out at the [[AI Safety Summit]] at [[Bletchley Park]] in November.<ref name=\"AnnounceGuardian\" />\n\n=== Updates ===\nGoogle partnered with [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] to integrate Gemini Nano and Gemini Pro into its [[Galaxy S24]] smartphone lineup in January 2024.<ref name=\"S24Bloomberg\" /><ref name=\"S24Wired\" /> The following month, Bard and Duet AI were unified under the Gemini brand,<ref name=\"GeminiRebrandNYT\" /><ref name=\"GeminiRebrandReuters\" /> with \"Gemini Advanced with Ultra 1.0\" debuting via a new \"AI Premium\" tier of the [[Google One]] subscription service.<ref name=\"AIPremium\" /> Gemini Pro also received a global launch.<ref name=\"Global\" />\n\nIn February, Google launched \"Gemini 1.5\" in a limited capacity, positioned as a more powerful and capable model than 1.0 Ultra.<ref name=\"1.5Wired\" /><ref name=\"1.5Forbes\" /><ref name=\"1.5FC\" /> This \"step change\" was achieved through various technical advancements, including a new architecture, a [[mixture-of-experts]] approach, and a larger one-million-token [[context window]], which equates to roughly an hour of silent video, 11&nbsp;hours of audio, 30,000&nbsp;lines of code, or 700,000&nbsp;words.<ref name=\"1.5BI\" /> The same month, Google debuted Gemma, a family of [[free and open-source]] LLMs that serve as a lightweight version of Gemini. They come in two sizes, with a neural network with two and seven&nbsp;billion parameters, respectively. Multiple publications viewed this as an response to Meta and others open-sourcing their AI models, and a stark reversal from Google's longstanding practice of keeping its AI proprietary.<ref name=\"GemmaFC\" /><ref name=\"GemmaBloomberg\" /><ref name=\"GemmaNYT\" />\n\nAt the [[Google I/O|Google I/O 2024]], Gemini 1.5 Flash is released.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gemini Flash |url=https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash/ |access-date=2024-05-17 |website=Google DeepMind |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Technical specifications ==\nThe first generation of Gemini (\"Gemini 1\") has three models, with the same [[software architecture]]. They are decoder-only [[Transformer (deep learning architecture)|transformers]], with modifications to allow efficient training and inference on TPUs. They have a context length of 32,768 tokens, with [[Transformer (deep learning architecture)#Multi-Query Attention|multi-query attention]]. Two versions of Gemini Nano, Nano-1 (1.8&nbsp;billion parameters) and Nano-2 (3.25&nbsp;billion parameters), are distilled from larger Gemini models, designed for use by [[edge device]]s such as smartphones. As Gemini is multimodal, each context window can contain multiple forms of input. The different modes can be interleaved and do not have to be presented in a fixed order, allowing for a multimodal conversation. For example, the user might open the conversation with a mix of text, picture, video, and audio, presented in any order, and Gemini might reply with the same free ordering.\n\nInput images may be of different [[Image resolution|resolutions]], while video is inputted as a sequence of images. Audio is sampled at 16 [[kHz]] and then converted into a sequence of tokens by the Universal Speech Model. Gemini's dataset is multimodal and multilingual, consisting of \"web documents, books, and code, and includ[ing] image, audio, and video data\".<ref name=\"WhitePaper\" />\n\nDemis Hassabis claims that training Gemini 1 used \"roughly the same amount of compute, maybe slightly more than what was rumored for GPT-4\".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Patel |first=Dwarkesh |date=2024-02-21 |title=Demis Hassabis - Scaling, Superhuman AIs, AlphaZero atop LLMs, Rogue Nations Threat |url=https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/demis-hassabis |access-date=2024-03-03 |website=www.dwarkeshpatel.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe second generation of Gemini (\"Gemini 1.5\") has two models published so far:<ref name=\"WhitePaper_1_5\" />\n\n* Gemini 1.5 Pro.

If it disappoints, it will embolden critics who say Google has fallen behind.\"<ref name=\"Hsiao\" />\n\nReacting to its unveiling in December 2023, [[University of Washington]] professor emeritus [[Oren Etzioni]] predicted a \"tit-for-tat [[arms race]]\" between Google and OpenAI. Professor [[Alexei A. Efros|Alexei Efros]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] praised the potential of Gemini's multimodal approach,<ref name=\"AnnounceWired\" /> while scientist [[Melanie Mitchell]] of the [[Santa Fe Institute]] called Gemini \"very sophisticated\". Professor Chirag Shah of the University of Washington was less impressed, likening Gemini's launch to the routineness of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[List of Apple Inc. media events|annual introduction]] of a new [[iPhone]]. Similarly, [[Stanford University]]'s Percy Liang, the University of Washington's [[Emily Bender]], and the [[University of Galway]]'s Michael Madden cautioned that it was difficult to interpret benchmark scores without insight into the training data used.<ref name=\"PeakHype\" /><ref name=\"Conversation\" /> Writing for ''[[Fast Company]]'', Mark Sullivan opined that Google had the opportunity to challenge the iPhone's dominant market share, believing that Apple was unlikely to have the capacity to develop functionality similar to Gemini with its [[Siri]] [[virtual assistant]].<ref name=\"AchillesHeel\" /> Google shares spiked by 5.3&nbsp;percent the day after Gemini's launch.<ref name=\"WallStreetReuters\" /><ref name=\"WallStreetMW\" />\n\nGoogle faced criticism for a demonstrative video of Gemini, which was not conducted in real time.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Elias |first=Steve Kovach, Jennifer |date=2023-12-08 |title=Google faces controversy over edited Gemini AI demo video |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/08/google-faces-controversy-over-edited-gemini-ai-demo-video.html |access-date=2023-12-09 |website=CNBC |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Gato (DeepMind)|Gato]], a multimodal neural network developed by DeepMind\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- DEVELOPMENT -->\n\n<ref name=\"IO2023NYT\">{{Cite news |last=Grant |first=Nico |date=May 10, 2023 |title=Google Builds on Tech's Latest Craze With Its Own A.I.
