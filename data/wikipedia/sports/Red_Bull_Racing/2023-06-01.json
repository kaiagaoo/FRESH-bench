[[Jackie Stewart]] sold his team to the [[Ford Motor Company]] late in 1999, and Ford made the decision to rebrand the team [[Jaguar Racing]] with little subsequent success over the next five years.\n\n[[File:Jean-Christophe Boullion 1995 Britain.jpg|thumb|left|Red Bull's involvement in Formula One dates back to {{F1|1995}}, when it first sponsored the [[Sauber]] team.]]\n\nThe Jaguar Racing [[Formula One]] constructor and racing team was put up for sale in September 2004 when Ford decided it could \"no longer make a compelling business case for any of its brands to compete in Formula One.\"<ref>{{cite news|title =Jaguar quits Formula One|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/3665810.stm|work =BBC Sport|date =17 September 2004|access-date =28 January 2007|archive-date =3 February 2008|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080203141956/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/3665810.stm|url-status =live}}</ref> Red Bull, an [[energy drink]]s company, agreed its purchase of Jaguar Racing on the final day of the sale, 15 November 2004.<ref name=\"Jaguarsold\">{{cite news| title =Red Bull snaps up Jaguar F1 team| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4012381.stm| work =BBC Sport| date =15 November 2004| access-date =28 January 2007| archive-date =17 January 2008| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080117133017/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4012381.stm| url-status =live}}</ref> [[BBC Sport]] reported that Ford asked bidders for a symbolic US$1 in return for a commitment to invest US$400&nbsp;million in the team over three Grand Prix seasons.<ref name=\"Jaguarsold\"/> The team continued to have access to the [[Cosworth]] engine developed for their 2005 chassis, and the operation continued under the new title. [[Christian Horner]] was installed as the new team boss and lined up [[David Coulthard]] and [[Christian Klien]] to drive for the team.\n\nRed Bull Racing was not the start of Red Bull's involvement in Formula One, as they sponsored [[Sauber]] from 1995 to 2004. After buying a Formula One team of its own, Red Bull ended its long-term partnership with the Swiss team. Red Bull also runs a young drivers programme, [[Red Bull Junior Team]], whereby Red Bull sponsors promising young drivers. High-profile drivers who have received this backing include [[Enrique Bernoldi]], [[Christian Klien]], [[Patrick Friesacher]], [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]] and [[Scott Speed]]. Red Bull also sponsors many drivers and teams competing in the [[FIA Formula 2 Championship|Formula 2 Championship]], Formula One's \"feeder\" series.\n\n=== Cosworth engines (2005) ===\n\n==== 2005 season ====\n{{see also|2005 Formula One World Championship}}\n[[File:Vitantonio Liuzzi 2005 Britain.jpg|left|thumb|[[Vitantonio Liuzzi]] during free practice at the [[2005 British Grand Prix]]]]\nRed Bull's owner, [[Dietrich Mateschitz]], reportedly tried to recruit former Formula One driver and [[BMW Motorsport]] chief (and fellow Austrian) [[Gerhard Berger]] to help guide the team through its debut season. However, this was never realised. For {{F1|2005}}, the chassis was christened the [[Red Bull RB1|RB1]]. Red Bull Racing used [[Cosworth]] engines in its maiden year due to the ease of continuing with the engine Jaguar Racing used.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nFormer [[McLaren]] driver David Coulthard led the team. Coulthard was chosen for his experience, considered ideal to help lead the fledgling team. For the second car, Red Bull shared the drive between two of its young sponsored drivers: [[Christian Klien]], who had driven for Jaguar in {{F1|2004}} and 2004 [[International Formula 3000|F3000]] champion [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]]. At first, it was announced that Klien and Liuzzi would swap driving duty every four races, but by the end of the season, Liuzzi had appeared only four times.\n\nRed Bull's first year in Formula One was a massive success compared to its predecessors, Jaguar Racing. They were 6th in the Constructors' Championship for most of the season, only beaten by the fast-improving [[BAR Honda]]s at the end of the season. In a single season, they amassed more points than Jaguar had in {{F1|2003}} and 2004. Coulthard, after a poor 2003 and 2004 with McLaren, was a revelation for the team while Klien showed that he had vastly improved from 2004.{{citation needed|reason=for Coulthard being a revelation|date=May 2016}} Overall they scored 34 points; 24 for Coulthard, 9 for Klien and 1 for Liuzzi. Red Bull was a consistent point and occasional [[Podium#Usage in motorsport|podium]] challenger for most of their debut season.\n\nAmerican driver [[Scott Speed]], who rose through the ranks in the American equivalent of Red Bull Junior Team, [[Red Bull Driver Search]], was Red Bull Racing's [[third driver]] in 2005 for the [[2005 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian]] and [[2005 United States Grand Prix|United States]] Grands Prix. Speed was attractive to Red Bull because of his American nationality which would raise the profile of both Red Bull and [[Formula One]] in America, a market where the sport has traditionally struggled to make an impact.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n=== Ferrari engines (2006) ===\n\n==== 2006 season ====\n{{see also|2006 Formula One World Championship}}\nOn 23 April 2005, the team announced a deal to utilise customer [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] engines in {{F1|2006}}. This coincided with a rule change mandating the use of [[V8 engine]]s, making it likely that both Red Bull Racing and Ferrari would use the same specification engine. Red Bull Racing continued to use [[Michelin]] tyres, rather than the [[Bridgestone]]s used by Ferrari.\n[[File:Formel1 Rennwagen 'RedBul-Racing' Hockenheim 2006 001.JPG|thumb|250x250px|Coulthard driving the [[Red Bull RB2|RB2]] at the [[2006 German Grand Prix]].]]\nOn 8 November 2005, Red Bull Racing hired [[Adrian Newey]], the highly successful [[McLaren]] technical director.<ref>{{cite news|title =Newey makes shock Red Bull move|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4416342.stm|work =BBC Sport|date =5 November 2005|access-date =28 January 2007|archive-date =4 December 2005|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20051204042831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4416342.stm|url-status =live}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 December 2005, the team's second car, the [[Red Bull RB2]], hit the track for the first time. David Coulthard completed a handful of laps of the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] circuit in England, and declared the new car was a \"sexy looking thing\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080709004315/http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2005/12/3884.html Coulthard impressed with RB2] formula1.com, December 2005</ref> In early testing Red Bull was plagued with cooling problems and overheating of car components.<ref>[http://www.f1technical.net/news/1541 Red Bull RB2 suffers overheating problems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217064658/http://www.f1technical.net/news/1541 |date=17 February 2012 }} f1testing.net, January 2006</ref>\n\nAt the opening race of the 2006 season in [[2006 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]], [[Christian Klien]] qualified eighth (ahead of [[Giancarlo Fisichella]]'s Renault and both BMWs). Coulthard had problems when he flat-spotted a tyre fighting with [[Nick Heidfeld]], and finished 10th; the cooling problems returned when his [[Ferrari]] engine expired on the slowing down lap, forcing a grid penalty for the following race. In [[2006 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]], Coulthard made up several places from the back of the grid but was forced to retire with hydraulic problems, while Klien had an opening lap incident with [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] and after pitting for repairs also retired with hydraulic failure. Coulthard got a point in [[2006 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]] after Scott Speed was penalised for passing him under the yellow flags. The following races were marred with retirements and lowly finishes.\n\nCoulthard finished 3rd at [[2006 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], the team's first podium finish. Team boss Christian Horner said before the race that if one of his cars were to finish on the podium, he would jump into a swimming pool at the track naked. He ended up jumping into the pool wearing only a red cape. Coincidentally both [[Stewart Grand Prix]] and [[Jaguar Racing]], the team's predecessors, also scored their maiden podiums at that race.\n\n[[File:Robert Doornbos 2006 Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Doornbos]] replaced Klien for the last three races of the {{F1|2006}} season.]]\n\nCoulthard scored a point at [[2006 Canadian Grand Prix|Montreal]], passing [[Jenson Button]] in the closing stages of the race despite starting in last place due to an engine change that warranted a grid penalty. Klien also fared well, driving the second RB2 to 11th position. At the {{F1 GP|2006|United States}} Klien retired along with eight other cars including [[Toro Rosso]] driver Scott Speed on the first lap after a series of first corner incidents. Coulthard finished 7th.\n\nThe team finished 7th in the FIA Constructors' Championship, with 16 points, five points ahead of the struggling [[Williams F1|Williams]] team. Coulthard (14 pts) finished in 13th place in the drivers' standings, the departed Klien (2 pts) was classified in 18th position. Klien's replacement, [[Robert Doornbos]], failed to score any points.\n\n=== Renault engines (2007\u20132015) ===\n====Customer era (2007\u20132010)====\n=====2007 season=====\n{{see also|2007 Formula One World Championship}}\n[[File:Mark Webber 2007 Malaysia (cropped).jpg|thumb|250x250px|[[Mark Webber (racing driver)|Mark Webber]] driving for the team at the [[2007 Malaysian Grand Prix]].]]\n[[File:Mark Webber 2007 Britain 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mark Webber (racing driver)|Mark Webber]] driving for RBR at the [[2007 British Grand Prix]].

It was worse for Coulthard however, who crashed heavily with [[Williams F1|Williams's]] [[Alexander Wurz]] in the late stages of the race. [[2007 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]] was more of the same for Webber, while Coulthard retired with brake problems. However, in [[2007 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] the team showed improving pace, and Coulthard and Webber were running 7th (with Coulthard starting from the back) and 8th respectively before reliability problems put both out of the race in quick succession. However, in testing at [[Circuit de Catalunya|Barcelona]] Coulthard has set the fastest lap in the new configuration of the circuit (since superseded by [[Felipe Massa]]). Coulthard secured the team's first points by scoring a gritty 5th with a faulty gearbox on his closing laps in [[2007 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]], while Webber was dogged with hydraulic problems all weekend, eventually retiring from the race after failing to set a competitive lap in qualifying. The performance hike the team experienced at the Catalan track left both drivers and team optimistic about their future results, with reliability troubles being as much a focus as the increase of their already competitive pace.\n\nRed Bull Racing further strengthened their technical department by hiring [[Geoff Willis]] as Technical Director on 17 July 2007.<ref>{{cite news| title =Geoff Willis joins Red Bull Technology| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns19409.html| date =17 July 2007| access-date =18 July 2007| archive-date =13 July 2018| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20180713074226/http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns19409.html| url-status =live}}</ref>\n\nAfter this, the drivers seemed to have a stroke of good luck during the unpredictable and exciting [[2007 European Grand Prix]] in which Webber finished 3rd, his second career podium. Coulthard backed it up with a strong 5th which was made all the more impressive by the fact he started 20th on the grid after the team mistakenly kept him in the pits too long resulting in him not being able to complete another qualifying lap.\n\nRed Bull had a strong end to the season. Webber came close to victory at the [[2007 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], but he was involved in a crash with [[Sebastian Vettel]]. During the same race, Coulthard again demonstrated his wet-weather ability and finished 4th.\n\nAt the [[2007 Chinese Grand Prix|Chinese Grand Prix]], Red Bull had a competitive qualifying session. Coulthard achieved 5th on the grid, along with Webber in 9th.\n\n=====2008 season=====\n{{see also|2008 Formula One World Championship}}\n[[File:Redbull-webber2-spain-2008-lrg.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Webber (racing driver)|Mark Webber]] driving for RBR at the [[2008 Spanish Grand Prix]].]]\nRed Bull continued with the same drivers in {{F1|2008}} and had numbers 9 and 10 on their cars after finishing 5th in the 2007 Constructors' Championship. Red Bull presented the [[Red Bull RB4|RB4]] at the [[Circuito de Jerez|Jerez circuit]] on 16 January and announced that [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]] would be their test and reserve driver for 2008 combining it with his GP2 drive with the [[Arden International]] GP2 team.\n\nAfter Webber retired from the [[2008 Australian Grand Prix|opening round]] he went on to score 5 consecutive points finishes. Coulthard had a tougher start to the 2008 campaign due to poor qualifying, but a 3rd place at [[2008 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]] gave Red Bull their first podium since the [[2007 European Grand Prix]]. At the half-way mark, the team had notched up 24 points&nbsp;\u2013 the same as their total for the 2007 season&nbsp;\u2013 and were locked in a fierce battle with [[Toyota Racing (Formula One team)|Toyota]] and Renault for 4th in the Constructors' Championship. The team had also resolved the reliability problems that had dogged them the previous year.\n\nHowever, as the season progressed, Red Bull failed to keep up with their competitors. Red Bull scored just 5 points in the last 10 races, and [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]]&nbsp;\u2013 the Red Bull 'B team'&nbsp;\u2013 had overhauled their total by the season's end and won the rain-affected {{F1 GP|2008|Italian}}, becoming the first Red Bull-owned team to win a race. This fact led many to claim that the Renault engine powering the Red Bull was lacking in horsepower compared to the Ferrari and Mercedes engines. For the 2009 season, Renault was allowed to equalise the difference in engine power compared to their competitors after the single-year freeze in engine development from 2007.<ref>{{cite news |last=Elizalde |first=Pablo |date=12 December 2008 |title=Renault get engine boost for 2009 |work=[[Autosport]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]] |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/72457 |access-date=20 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210411011629/https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/renault-gets-engine-boost-for-2009-4426771/4426771/ |archive-date=25 November 2022}}</ref>\n\nWebber notched up his 50th top ten grid position in 107 Grands Prix at the {{F1 GP|2008|Spanish}}. Coulthard announced his retirement from Formula One at the {{F1 GP|2008|British}} and, despite hopes for a strong final home Grand Prix, was forced to retire on the first lap, which also occurred at his final race in [[2008 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] where he retired at the second corner.\n\n=====2009 season=====\n{{see also|2009 Formula One World Championship}}\nFor {{F1|2009}}, Red Bull Racing launched their new [[Red Bull RB5|RB5]] chassis virtually on 8 February utilising a 3D computer-generated video narrated by Sebastian Vettel.

The team scored another 1\u20132 at the {{F1 GP|2009|German}} with Mark Webber (who scored his first win despite being given a drive-through penalty earlier on) leading home Sebastian Vettel. Mark Webber also took his second Formula One victory at the {{F1 GP|2009|Brazilian}}.

Vettel led the race until he slowed due to a spark-plug failure,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Spark plug was to blame for Vettel's power loss|url=http://en.espnf1.com/bahrain/motorsport/story/11380.html|access-date=17 August 2020|website=ESPN UK|language=en|archive-date=14 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414040805/http://en.espnf1.com/bahrain/motorsport/story/11380.html|url-status=live}}</ref> while the two [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]s and [[Lewis Hamilton]] overtook Vettel. Vettel finished fourth, and Webber finished eighth.\n\nIn [[2010 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], Vettel again took pole, with Webber in the second position. Vettel led the race and again looked set to take the race, but he reported a vibration of one of the front wheels on his car. The problem seemed to subside, and the decision was made to keep him on the track rather than pit him. A few corners later, the problem struck again, and Vettel ran off the track and subsequently retired, due to brake failure. Webber got wheelspin off the line and gave up one position on the run to the first right-handed corner. Subsequent errors led to him dropping a few more places, and near the end of the race, he crashed with Hamilton, destroying his front wing. He pitted to get a new one, and finished ninth, scoring two points.\n\nIn [[2010 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]], Webber took pole with Vettel in the third position. Vettel managed to pass both [[Nico Rosberg]] and Webber before the first corner, leading for all bar two laps en route to his and the team's first victory of the year. Webber led the other two laps and eventually finished second, with the team moving up into third in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n[[File:Vettel abu dabi 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Vettel won the 2010 World Drivers' Championship at the season-ending [[2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix|Abu Dhabi Grand Prix]].]]\nThe team once again scored pole position in [[2010 Chinese Grand Prix|China]], when Vettel managed to set a faster time than Webber, who completed the front row. Webber overtook Vettel at the start, but both were overtaken by [[Fernando Alonso]], who was later given a penalty for a false start. The race was then hit by rain and [[Jenson Button]] made the best strategy call and won the race, Vettel finished sixth whilst Webber was eighth. This left Vettel and Webber fifth and seventh in the Drivers' Championship respectively, and the team in third in the Constructors' Championship.\n\nAt the {{F1 GP|2010|Spanish}} the two drivers were the other way around, with Webber on pole position and Vettel second on the grid. Webber won the race without too much trouble.{{citation needed|reason=without too much trouble|date=May 2016}} Vettel, however, suffered brake problems and dropped to fourth&nbsp;\u2013 this became third when Hamilton had a puncture and crashed from second on the penultimate lap.\n\nWebber took pole position again at the {{F1 GP|2010|Monaco}}; Vettel qualified third behind [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]]'s [[Robert Kubica]], but overtook him at the start.

Following the pit stops, Webber and Vettel were running first and second until lap 40, when Vettel attempted to overtake Webber, leading to a collision between the two. Webber finished third, while Vettel was forced to retire. Neither driver took 100% of responsibility while senior members of the team alluded to the thought that Webber had not provided \"enough room\" for Vettel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8713780.stm|title=Mark Webber & Sebastian Vettel play crash blame game|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=BBC|date=30 May 2010|access-date=11 December 2012|archive-date=4 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604030142/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8713780.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2010 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], Hamilton took pole position&nbsp;\u2013 the first non-Red Bull pole of the year. Webber and Vettel were second and third respectively in qualifying before the pair finished fourth and fifth in the race. The team admitted that it was a track that the car struggled with.\n\nAt the {{F1 GP|2010|European}} in [[Valencia, Spain]], Vettel won from pole position, leading every lap of the race. Webber collided with the Lotus of [[Heikki Kovalainen]], flipping his Red Bull car into a somersault before landing and crashing into a tyre barrier.\n\nAt the {{F1 GP|2010|British}} at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]], Vettel took pole position but after a bad start, he got a puncture and subsequently dropped to the back of the field, eventually finishing seventh. Webber, who started from second, won after leading for the entire race.\n\nVettel qualified in pole position in front of the two Ferraris in [[2010 German Grand Prix|Germany]], but finished his home race behind the pair in third place. Webber qualified in fourth but finished in sixth behind both the McLaren cars. During the race [[Felipe Massa]] controversially let [[Fernando Alonso]] past into the lead to win the race after a message from the team. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said: \"That was the most blatant team order ever\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8852910.stm|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=BBC|title=Red Bull boss Horner criticises Ferrari \"team orders\"|date=25 July 2010|access-date=31 July 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100727134038/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8852910.stm| archive-date= 27 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> He also criticised Ferrari for not letting their drivers race each other.\n\nAt the {{F1 GP|2010|Hungarian}} in [[Budapest]], Vettel again took pole position and was leading until the safety car came out. He was second behind Webber, who started second and was then given a drive-through penalty for exceeding the ten-car maximum distance between himself and the safety car. This cost him second place and he finished third. Webber won the race after using his super-soft tyres for over half the race to build up a lead to keep him ahead after his stop. Webber won with [[Fernando Alonso]] ten seconds behind in second place.\n\nThe {{F1 GP|2010|Belgian}} saw Webber claim pole position, despite McLaren and Ferrari having a straight-line speed advantage. At the start, the anti-stall device on Webber's car came on, dropping the Australian to 5th. Vettel, meanwhile in 3rd (after starting 4th) was chasing Jenson Button for 2nd place when he collided with the Brit at the Bus Stop. After sensing an inside passing opportunity, Vettel attempted to quickly change direction while under braking, causing the car to spear into the side of Button's McLaren. Button retired from the race, while Vettel was able to pit for repairs. He subsequently received a drive-through penalty for his action and suffered a rear tyre puncture while attempting to overtake [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]], finishing 15th. Webber was able to capitalise on the DNF of Button and Alonso, as well as a mistake by Renault's [[Robert Kubica]], during his pit stop, and finish 2nd, behind race winner Hamilton.\n\nAt the {{F1 GP|2010|Italian}} in [[Monza]], Webber had a bad start and was 9th from 4th place on the grid after the first lap. Vettel had brake binding problems for a short period, around lap 20, and he too dropped back a place but was then back on the pace. Webber was held back by [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]] in the latter part of the race, until he passed, and finished 6th. Vettel stayed out on soft tyres until the penultimate lap, doing better lap times than Webber and overtaking Mark when he pitted, to finish fourth.\n\nAt the {{F1 GP|2010|Korean}} in [[Yeongam]], Vettel gave the team its 19th pole position, while Webber started second, making it a Red Bull front row. On lap 18, Webber spun and hit the wall, and hit the [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] of [[Nico Rosberg]], causing both drivers to retire. Worse was to come for the team when Vettel's engine failed just 10 laps from the finish, while he was in the lead, and the German retired and handed his lead to [[Fernando Alonso]] in the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Red Bull had suffered their first double retirement since the [[2008 Australian Grand Prix]] and as a result, Webber lost his championship lead and Vettel's engine failure prevented him from leading the championship for the first time in 2010, but the team still led the Constructors' Championship.\n\nAt the {{F1 GP|2010|Brazilian}} in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], Red Bull Racing became Constructors' Champion for the first time after Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber finished 1\u20132 in the race, enough to finish ahead of [[McLaren]] and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. In doing so Red Bull became the first Austrian team to win the Formula One Constructors' Championship. Christian Horner stated that the main goal had been achieved and that now his remaining aim was to win the Drivers' Championship and put the icing on the cake of Red Bull's year. In some other teams, the drivers would have been told to change positions, to improve better placed Mark Webber's chances to win the drivers' title in the last race, but the team insisted that the faster driver should win the race, and kept being reluctant to give any orders of the kind \"let your teammate pass\" to their drivers.\n\nIn the [[2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix|final race]] at [[Abu Dhabi]], Sebastian Vettel won the race and the Formula One Drivers' Championship. Red Bull finished the year with a total of 9 Grand Prix victories with five going to Sebastian Vettel and four going to Mark Webber. Red Bull claimed a total of 15 pole positions with 10 going to Vettel and five going to Webber. The team scored six fastest laps three scored by Vettel and three scored by Webber. Horner also praised the sportsmanship of both drivers stating that they conducted themselves in a well orderly and mannered fashion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/88286|title=Horner praises drivers' sportsmanship|work=autosport.com|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=14 November 2010|access-date=14 November 2010|first=Steven|last=English|archive-date=16 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116132623/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/88286|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Renault full-works partnership era (2011\u20132015)====\n=====2011 season=====\n{{see also|2011 Formula One World Championship}}\n[[File:2011 Italian GP - Vettel.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Sebastian Vettel]] competing at the [[2011 Italian Grand Prix]].]]\nRed Bull Racing was officially promoted to [[Renault F1|Renault]]'s full-works partnership status, receiving free engines as Renault's full-works constructor team was rebranded to [[Lotus Renault GP]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Bull get budget boost through Infiniti link-up|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/9409120.stm|work=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 March 2011|accessdate=1 March 2011|archive-date=6 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220106040912/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/9409120.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Red Bull now Renault's works team \u2013 Horner|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-red-bull-now-renault-s-works-team-horner/411557/|work=motorsport.com|publisher=[[motorsport.com]]|date=15 September 2011|accessdate=15 September 2011|archive-date=16 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230216153547/https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-red-bull-now-renault-s-works-team-horner/411557/|url-status=live}}</ref> Both [[Sebastian Vettel]] and [[Mark Webber (racing driver)|Mark Webber]] were retained by the team for the {{F1|2011}} season, as was engine supplier Renault.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/217838/red-bull-extend-vettel-contract/ | title = Red Bull extend Vettel contract | publisher = GP Update | date = 21 August 2009 | access-date = 29 January 2011 | archive-date = 23 July 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723135956/http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/217838/red-bull-extend-vettel-contract/ | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Webber signs with Red Bull for 2011|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2010/06/07/webber-signs-with-red-bull-for-2011/|first=Keith|last=Collantine|work=F1 Fanatic|publisher=Keith Collantine|date=7 June 2010|access-date=7 June 2010|archive-date=10 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610221800/http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2010/06/07/webber-signs-with-red-bull-for-2011/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=renaultengines>{{cite web|title=Red Bull Racing and Renault Announce New Agreement|url=http://www.renaultsportf1.com/RED-BULL-RACING-AND-RENAULT.html?lang=fr|work=[[Renault Sport F1]]|access-date=2 January 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090214/http://www.renaultsportf1.com/RED-BULL-RACING-AND-RENAULT.html?lang=fr|archive-date=24 September 2015}}</ref> Vettel defended his world title&nbsp;\u2013 becoming the ninth driver to do so&nbsp;\u2013 after winning eleven of the season's races, and also achieved 15 pole positions during the season, breaking [[Nigel Mansell]]'s record from the {{F1|1992}} season.

In [[2013 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]] the team went better with Vettel again putting the RB9 on pole, but unlike in Australia winning the race, albeit under heavy controversy. Vettel won the race after disobeying team orders, and so despite the 1\u20132 result, the race was overshadowed by Vettel's actions. In [[2013 Chinese Grand Prix|China]], the third race of the season, Vettel qualified in 9th whilst Webber qualified 14th after an issue with his fuel pick up led him to have to stop the car on the track. Infiniti Red Bull failed to give the FIA a 1-litre fuel sample, therefore, placing Webber at the back of the grid. The downfall of his performance was matched when a collision and then a dislodged wheel nut led to Webber not completing the race. Vettel finished in 4th, retaining his lead in the World Championship. In [[2013 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]], the fourth race of the season, Vettel qualified in second place behind Nico Rosberg. Webber qualified fifth but after a 3 place grid penalty started the race in seventh. In the race, Webber failed to improve on his qualifying position finishing 7th whilst his teammate won the race in a dominating fashion. After the fourth race of the season, Infiniti Red Bull finished the first round of flyaway races leading both the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships. [[Sebastian Vettel]] extended his contract with Infiniti Red Bull Racing until the end of 2015, despite interests in racing for Ferrari and Mercedes.

Renault struggled to get the new hybrid engine to function properly all through testing with the combustion engine, the kinetic recovery system, and the turbo all unable to work as one.\n\nAt the {{F1 GP|2014|Australian}}, Ricciardo had qualified second on his first race for the team while Vettel qualified a rather distant 13th being at least 1.8 seconds off pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton. In the race itself, Ricciardo finished second while Vettel retired after just three laps due to a power unit failure. However, after the race, Ricciardo was disqualified for violating the FIA's new rule of capping fuel use at 100&nbsp;kg per hour in each race. He thus lost his podium finish. Red Bull appealed this decision on 14 April but lost their case.\n\nAt the {{F1 GP|2014|Malaysian}} Vettel qualified second while Ricciardo qualified fifth. On lap 49 Ricciardo had to retire due to a technical failure while Vettel went on to finish third and earn his first podium finish of the season. Ricciardo was hit with a ten-place grid penalty for the {{F1 GP|2014|Bahrain}}, due to an unsafe release by Red Bull at one of his pit stops. At the {{F1 GP|2014|Bahrain}} Ricciardo qualified third, but dropped to 13th due to his ten-place grid penalty from the previous week. Vettel qualified 11th. Ricciardo managed to finish fourth, obtaining his first championship points of the season. Vettel finished sixth. At the {{F1 GP|2014|Chinese}}, under harsh weather conditions, Ricciardo qualified 2nd, with Vettel qualifying third. Ricciardo finished in 4th again, nearly 25 seconds ahead of his teammate Vettel, who finished 5th.\n\nRicciardo would go on to obtain the first podium finish in his career as a Formula One driver at the {{F1 GP|2014|Spanish}}, after qualifying third, over a second behind polesitter Lewis Hamilton. Vettel did not participate in Q3 due to problems with his gearbox, which ultimately needed to be replaced, incurring a five-place grid penalty. Despite starting from the 15th position, Vettel managed to finish the race in 4th, setting the fastest lap of the race in the process. In [[2014 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], Ricciardo won the race, achieving his first career victory in Formula One.\n\nAfter an {{F1 GP|2014|Austrian}} with poor results, including Vettel's retirement, Christian Horner described the performance of the Renault engine as \"unacceptable.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/114598 |title=Red Bull: Renault form is unacceptable |work=Autosport.com |publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]] |author=Noble, Jonathan |date=22 June 2014 |access-date=24 June 2014 |archive-date=25 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625081905/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/114598 |url-status=live }}</ref> He also mocked Renault in an interview with [[Servus TV]] by saying that \"the big difference between Mercedes and Renault is that when a driver with a Mercedes engine pushes the overtake button his car goes faster.

It was expected from the progress Renault made with the engine in 2014 that in 2015 it would be close to the Mercedes duo of Hamilton and Rosberg. However, it quickly became apparent that reliability, power, and drivability were all major issues that plagued the team through the season.\n\nAt the {{F1 GP|2015|Australian}} Ricciardo qualified 7th while Kvyat qualified 13th. Kvyat failed to start the race due to a gearbox failure, whilst Ricciardo finished the race in sixth, a lap down from the race winner, Lewis Hamilton. The team scored their best finish in [[2015 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], where Ricciardo and Kvyat finished 2\u20133. Their only opportunity to win a race occurred at the {{F1 GP|2015|United States}}, however, both of the team's drivers made some mistakes allowing both of the Mercedes cars to pass them. Lewis Hamilton won the race and, as a result, his third Formula One World Championship.\n\nCome the end of the season, it was the first winless season for Infiniti Red Bull since 2008, and come seasons end, Red Bull wanted to end its partnership with Renault due to the lack of progress and confidence expressed by Renault. Red Bull would however be unable to agree to have another engine instead opting to run Renault engines for the 2016 season but rebadged as TAG-Heuer.\n\nThey ended the season in fourth place on 187 points with Kvyat in seventh (95 points) and Ricciardo in eighth (92 points), their lowest finish position in seven years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statsf1.com/en/2015.aspx|title=2015|website=www.statsf1.com|access-date=22 January 2019|archive-date=3 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403133943/https://www.statsf1.com/en/2015.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statsf1.com/en/red-bull.aspx|title=Red Bull \u2022 STATS F1|website=www.statsf1.com|access-date=22 January 2019|archive-date=23 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123010255/https://www.statsf1.com/en/red-bull.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== TAG Heuer-badged Renault engines (2016\u20132018) ===\n\n==== 2016 season ====\n{{see also|2016 Formula One World Championship}}\nFor 2016, Red Bull Racing used Renault engines branded as [[TAG Heuer]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/latest/headlines/2015/12/red-bull-to-run-tag-heuer-badged-renault-engines-in-2016.html |title=Red Bull to run TAG Heuer-badged Renault engines in 2016 |work=formula1.com |date=4 December 2015 |access-date=10 March 2016 |archive-date=7 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607164922/https://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/latest/headlines/2015/12/red-bull-to-run-tag-heuer-badged-renault-engines-in-2016.html |url-status=live }}</ref> due to their public breakdown with Renault in 2015.

At the {{F1 GP|2018|Monaco}} Red Bull had a dominant car due to its highly efficient high down-force setup. Ricciardo scored a pole position, and despite running into an engine issue costing him power, he eventually won the race. This incident re-ignited the bad relationship with its engine manufacturer, Renault. Meanwhile, Verstappen crashed during free practice 3 and started from 20th on the grid, finishing the race in 9th place. This race also put an end to a streak of incidents for Verstappen. Monaco was also the last race that saw Daniel Ricciardo on the podium with Red Bull, with him parting ways with the team and joining rival team Renault at the end of the season.\n\nThe European season saw consistent podiums and a good form, with Verstappen winning Red Bull's home race at the Red Bull Ring during the {{F1 GP|2018|Austrian}}. The second half of the season saw great form from Verstappen and good development of the car, as Verstappen scored 6 out of 8 possible podiums, and was the driver which scored the most points following the 2018 World Champion Lewis Hamilton. Ricciardo had a spree of mechanical issues and retirements during the second half of the season, with him getting 7 retirements in total and no podiums after the first six races coming to the end of the season. Verstappen won the {{F1 GP|2018|Mexican}} from second after pole position was grabbed by his teammate, making it Red Bull's first front-row lock-out in the turbo-hybrid era.\n\nVerstappen was also finding himself in a back-to-back win at the [[Brazilian Grand Prix]] but clashed with rival Esteban Ocon as the latter tried to unlap himself, costing him the victory. Following the race the drivers conflicted, resulting in 2 days of public service for Verstappen, which he completed on 9 February 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/141410/verstappen-completes-public-service-penalty|title=Max Verstappen completes Brazilian GP public service penalty|last=Horton|first=Phillip|website=Autosport.com|language=en|access-date=13 February 2019|archive-date=14 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214002752/https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/141410/verstappen-completes-public-service-penalty|url-status=live}}</ref> Ricciardo's multiple retirements would end up costing both himself and Red Bull key points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships.

Scuderia Toro Rosso (STR) operates as a separate team, but the two share certain technical resources. In 2006 STR used a chassis based on the 2005 Red Bull Racing [[Red Bull RB1]] chassis, originally designed by Jaguar Racing, and Minardi's contracted supply of rev-limited [[V10 engine|V10]] [[Cosworth]] engines. It was widely speculated that the 2007 chassis for both teams would be essentially the same [[Adrian Newey]] design, although Red Bull was careful to announce that the \"STR2 will be built by Red Bull Technology, and Toro Rosso will fully own the intellectual rights of the car\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/56126|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|title=Berger confident STR2 will get green light|work=autosport.com|date=3 January 2007|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|access-date=28 April 2009|archive-date=22 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222100342/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/56126|url-status=live}}</ref> Formula One teams are not allowed to use another team's chassis.

Liuzzi retained his seat in STR for the 2007 season. [[Sebastian Vettel]] replaced Speed in the middle of the 2007 season, and [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] replaced Liuzzi at STR for the {{F1|2008}} season. Against expectation, Toro Rosso performed well during the 2008 season and Sebastian Vettel won the [[2008 Italian Grand Prix]]. This meant that Toro Rosso took their first win before Red Bull Racing, and helped to secure Vettel a drive with Red Bull Racing for 2009 when he also took that team's first win. For {{F1|2020}}, the team was rebranded as Scuderia AlphaTauri, after [[AlphaTauri (Fashion Brand)|AlphaTauri]], Red Bull's fashion brand. Scuderia AlphaTauri achieved their maiden Grand Prix win under the new name at the [[2020 Italian Grand Prix]].

The [[prototype]] vehicle was made to answer [[Kazunori Yamauchi]]'s question: \"If you built the fastest racing car on land, one that throws aside all rules and regulations, what would that car look like, how would it perform, and how would it feel to drive?\" The vehicle was designed by [[Adrian Newey]] in conjunction with Yamauchi.
