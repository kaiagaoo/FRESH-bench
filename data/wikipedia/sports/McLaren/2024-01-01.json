Limited''' is a British [[auto racing|motor racing]] team based at the [[McLaren Technology Centre]] in [[Woking]], Surrey, England. McLaren is best known as a [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One constructors|constructor]], the second oldest active team and the second most successful Formula One team after [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], having won {{F1cstat|MCL|wins}} races, 12 [[Formula One Drivers' Championship|Drivers' Championships]] and 8 [[Formula One constructors' championship|Constructors' Championships]]. McLaren also has a history of competing in [[American open wheel racing]], as both an entrant and a chassis constructor, and has won the [[Can-Am|Canadian-American Challenge Cup]] (Can-Am) [[sports car racing]] championship. The team is a subsidiary of the [[McLaren Group]], which owns a majority of the team.\n\nFounded in 1963 by New Zealander [[Bruce McLaren]], the team won its first Grand Prix at the [[1968 Belgian Grand Prix]], but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, which they dominated from 1967 to 1971. Further American triumph followed, with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for [[Mark Donohue]] in [[1972 Indianapolis 500|1972]] and [[Johnny Rutherford]] in [[1974 Indianapolis 500|1974]] and [[1976 Indianapolis 500|1976]]. After Bruce McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970, [[Teddy Mayer]] took over and led the team to their first Formula One Constructors' Championship in {{F1|1974}}, with [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] and [[James Hunt]] winning the Drivers' Championship in 1974 and {{F1|1976}} respectively. 1974 also marked the start of a long-standing sponsorship by the [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarette brand.\n\nIn 1981, McLaren merged with [[Ron Dennis]]' [[Project Four Racing]]; Dennis took over as team principal, and shortly afterwards organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team. This began the team's most successful era; with [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]] and [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] engines, [[Niki Lauda]], [[Alain Prost]], and [[Ayrton Senna]] won seven Drivers' Championships between them and the team took six Constructors' Championships. The combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant\u2014together they won all but one race in {{F1|1988}}\u2014but later their rivalry soured and Prost left for Ferrari. Fellow English team [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] offered the most consistent challenge during this period, the two winning every constructors' title between {{F1|1984}} and {{F1|1994}}. By the mid-1990s, Honda had withdrawn from Formula One, Senna had moved to Williams, and the team went three seasons without a win. With [[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains|Mercedes-Benz]] engines, [[West (cigarette)|West]] sponsorship, and former Williams designer [[Adrian Newey]], further championships came in {{F1|1998}} and {{F1|1999}} with driver [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]], and during the 2000s the team were consistent front-runners, with driver [[Lewis Hamilton]] taking their latest title in {{F1|2008}}.\n\nRon Dennis retired as McLaren team principal in 2009, handing over to long-time McLaren employee [[Martin Whitmarsh]]. At the end of 2013, after the team's worst season since 2004, Whitmarsh was ousted. McLaren announced in 2013 that they would be using [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] engines from 2015 onwards, replacing Mercedes-Benz.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/21655985|title=McLaren poised to switch to Honda engines for 2015 season|date=4 March 2013|last=Benson|first=Andrew|publisher=BBC|access-date=7 January 2020}}</ref> The team raced as McLaren Honda for the first time since 1992 at the [[2015 Australian Grand Prix]]. In September 2017, McLaren announced they had agreed on an engine supply with [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] from 2018 to 2020.

Wanting to compete in the [[Australasia]]n [[Tasman Series]], Bruce approached his employers, but when team owner Charles Cooper insisted on using 1.5-litre Formula One-specification engines instead of the 2.5-litre motors permitted by the Tasman rules, Bruce decided to set up his own team to run him and his prospective Formula One teammate [[Timmy Mayer]] with custom-built Cooper cars.<ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|page=65}}</ref>\n\nBruce won the [[1964 Tasman Series|1964 series]], but Mayer was killed in practice for the final race at the [[Longford Circuit]] in [[Tasmania]].

The 'B' version raced in [[Can-Am]] in the [[1966 Can-Am season|1966 season]].]]\nMcLaren's first racing car designed and built \"from the rubber up\" by Bruce McLaren Motor Racing was the M1. The car with a small block Oldsmobile had immediate success driven by Bruce McLaren. The car was raced in North America and Europe in 1964 in various A sports and United States Road Racing Championship events. In 1965 the team car was the M1A prototype from which the production Elva M1As were based. In late 1965, the M1B (also known as Mk2) was the team car for the North American races at the end of the year. For the Can-Am Series, which started in 1966, McLaren created the M3 which Bruce and [[Chris Amon]] drove&nbsp;\u2013 customer cars also appeared in several races in the [[1966 Can-Am season|1966 season]]. With the M3, they led two races but scored no wins, and the inaugural title was taken by John Surtees in a Lola T70. The following year, Robin Herd purpose-designed the [[Chevrolet]] V8-powered [[McLaren M6A|M6A]], delays with the Formula One programme allowing the team to spend extra resources on developing the Can-Am car which was the first to be painted in McLaren orange. With Denny Hulme now partnering Bruce, they won five of six races and Bruce won the championship, setting the pattern for the next four years. In the [[1968 Can-Am season|1968 season]], they used a new car, the M8, to win four races; non-works McLarens took the other two, but this time Hulme was victorious overall. In the [[1969 Can-Am season|1969 season]], McLaren domination became total as they won all 11 races with the M8B; Hulme won five, and Bruce won six and the Drivers' Championship.<ref name=\"clockworkorange\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bruce-mclaren.com/the-racing-team/articles/clockwork-orange-mclaren-domination.html|title=Clockwork Orange&nbsp;\u2013 McLaren Domination|first=Mark|last=Hughes|author-link=Mark Hughes (journalist)|work=Bruce McLaren Trust|access-date=8 April 2010|archive-date=3 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165406/http://www.bruce-mclaren.com/the-racing-team/articles/clockwork-orange-mclaren-domination.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> From 1969 onwards, McLaren M12&nbsp;\u2013 the customer \"variant\" of the M8&nbsp;\u2013 was driven by several entrants, including a version modified by Jim Hall of Chaparral fame. McLaren's success in Can-Am brought with it financial rewards, both prize money and money from selling cars to other teams, that helped to support the team and fund the nascent and relatively poor-paying Formula One programme.<ref name=\"clockworkorange\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Nye|1988|page=36}}</ref>\n\n[[File:McLarenM8D.jpg|thumb|right|Bruce McLaren was killed testing a McLaren M8D at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]] in 1970.]]\nWhen Bruce was killed testing the [[1970 Can-Am season|1970 season]]'s M8D, he was at first replaced by [[Dan Gurney]], then later by [[Peter Gethin]]. They won two and one races, respectively, while Hulme won six on the way to the championship. Private teams competing in the 1970 Can-Am series included older M3Bs as well as the M12&nbsp;\u2013 the customer version of the team's M8B. In the [[1971 Can-Am season|1971 season]], the team held off the challenge of 1969 world champion [[Jackie Stewart]] in the [[Lola Cars|Lola]] T260, winning eight races, with Peter Revson taking the title. Hulme also won three Can-Am races in the [[1972 Can-Am season|1972 season]], but the [[McLaren M20]] was defeated by the [[Porsche 917]]/10s of [[Mark Donohue]] and [[George Follmer]]. Faced by the greater resources of Porsche, McLaren decided to abandon Can-Am at the end of 1972 and focus solely on [[open wheel car|open-wheel racing]].<ref name=\"clockworkorange\"/> When the original Can-Am series ceased at the end of the [[1974 Can-Am season|1974 season]], McLaren was by far the most successful constructor with 43 wins.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|2009|page=301}}</ref>\n\n===Indianapolis 500===\n[[File:1973RevsonIndyMcLaren.jpg|thumb|The McLaren M16C was driven by Peter Revson in the [[1972 Indianapolis 500]].]]\nMcLaren first contested the [[United States Auto Club]]'s (USAC) Indianapolis 500 race in [[1970 Indianapolis 500|1970]], encouraged by their tyre supplier [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]], which wanted to break competitor [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]]'s stranglehold on the event.

The first was to market the McLaren brand and some of the McLaren Formula One team's prominent American based sponsors in a primarily North America centric racing series, as Formula One only had three races in North America in [[2021 Formula One World Championship|2021]] and only one of those races was in the United States. The second was to branch McLaren's engineering expertise into a racing series that the other Formula One teams were not involved in, as Brown thought McLaren would stand out more amongst its competitors in IndyCar than it would in other racing series. Brown also stated that McLaren chose to partner with Schmidt Peterson Motorsports because their previous efforts fielding their team with assistance from Andretti Autosport and Carlin exclusively for the Indianapolis 500 had not been successful and that the purchase of the IndyCar Series by [[Roger Penske|Penske Entertainment]] gave McLaren more confidence in the long term viability and stability of the series compared to the previous ownership under [[Tony George]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Diffey|first1=Leigh|title=Long Beach 'where it all started' for Zak Brown|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5Kw48_CwFc&t=673s|website=Youtube|publisher=NBC Sports Network|access-date=1 October 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2021, it was announced that McLaren Racing will acquire a majority stake in the IndyCar Team.
