The Senators posted a 99\u201353 record and cruised to the pennant seven games ahead of the [[New York Yankees]], but in the [[1933 World Series]] the Giants exacted their revenge, winning in five games. Following the loss, the Senators sank all the way to seventh place in [[1934 Washington Senators season|1934]] and attendance began to fall. Despite the return of Harris as manager from 1935 to 1942 and again from 1950 to 1954, Washington was mostly a losing ball club for the next 25 years contending for the pennant only during World War II.

Nevertheless, the Twins argued that the Metrodome was obsolete. Furthermore, they said sharing a stadium with the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Minnesota Vikings]], as they had been doing since their 1961 move to Minnesota, limited the team's revenue and made it difficult to sustain a top-notch, competitive team. The team was rumored to contemplate moving to [[New Jersey]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Portland, Oregon]], the [[Piedmont Triad|Greensboro/Winston-Salem, North Carolina area]], and elsewhere in search of a more financially competitive market. In 2002, the team was nearly disbanded when Major League Baseball selected the Twins and the [[Montreal Expos]] (now the [[Washington Nationals]] franchise) for [[2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan|elimination]] due to their financial weakness. The impetus for league contraction diminished after a court decision forced the Twins to play out their lease on the Metrodome. However, Twins owner Carl Pohlad continued his efforts to move, pursuing litigation against the Metropolitan Stadium Commission and obtaining a state court ruling that his team was not obligated to play in the Metrodome after the 2006 season. This cleared the way for the Twins to move or disband before the 2007 season if a new deal was not reached.\n\n===Target Field===\n{{Main|Target Field}}\n[[Image:Target Field April 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Target Field]] in 2010.]]\nIn response to the threatened loss of the Twins, the Minnesota private and public sector negotiated and approved a financing package for a replacement stadium\u2014 a baseball-only outdoor, natural turf ballpark in the [[North Loop, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] of [[Central, Minneapolis|downtown Minneapolis]]\u2014 owned by a new entity known as the Minnesota Ballpark Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2010/04/01/17066/target_field_the_house_that_jerry_bell_willed_to_completion |last=Weiner |first=Jay |title=Target Field: 'The House That Jerry Bell Willed to Completion' |publisher=MinnPost |date=April 1, 2010 |access-date=July 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Target Field]] was constructed at a cost of $544.4&nbsp;million (including site acquisition and infrastructure), utilizing the proceeds of a $392&nbsp;million public bond offering based on a 0.15% sales tax in Hennepin County and private financing of $185&nbsp;million provided by the [[Carl Pohlad|Pohlad family]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/opinion/editorials/46497222.html |title=Editorial: Target Field built to exceed expectations |newspaper=Star Tribune |date=May 31, 2009 |access-date=July 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jack |last=Gordon |url=http://www.tcbmag.com/print.aspx?print_page=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061printp1.aspx&string_referer=/industriestrends/commercialrealestate/127061p1.aspx |title=The Coolest Ballpark in America |publisher=Twin Cities Business Magazine |date=March 2010 |access-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003105952/http://www.tcbmag.com/print.aspx?print_page=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061printp1.aspx&string_referer=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061p1.aspx |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  As part of the deal, the Twins also signed a 30-year lease of the new stadium, effectively guaranteeing the continuation of the team in Minnesota for a long time to come.

On the back, the player names are in navy and numbers are in red. Likewise, the new navy Minnesota map with red star was featured on the left sleeve. Navy pinstripes were also added.

The uniforms are paired with the road all-navy \"M\" cap with red star.<ref name=TwinsUniforms2023/>\n\nThe alternate home cream uniform featured a new \"Twin Cities\" wordmark (with the underline below \"win Citie\") in navy. The set, which lacked red, also featured two crossed navy flags representing both Minneapolis (\"M\") and St. Paul (\"STP\"). An alternate all-navy cap with the \"TC\" insignia is used, except the \"TC\" is in cream and also lacked red elements.<ref name=TwinsUniforms2023/>\n\n===Past uniforms===\nFrom 1961 to 1971 the Twins sported uniforms bearing the classic \"Twins\" script and numerals in navy outlined in red. They wore navy caps with an interlocking \"TC\" on the front; this was adopted because Griffith was well aware of the bitter rivalry between Minneapolis and Saint Paul and didn't want to alienate fans in either city. The original \"Minnie and Paul\" alternate logo appears on the left sleeve of both the pinstriped white home uniform and gray road uniform.<ref name=TwinsUniforms/>\n\nFor the 1972 season the Twins updated their uniforms. The color scheme on the \"Twins\" script and numerals were reversed, pinstripes were removed from the home uniform, and an updated \"Minnie and Paul\" roundel patch replaced the originals on the left sleeve.<ref name=TwinsUniforms/>\n\nIn 1973, the Twins switched to polyester pullover uniforms, which included a powder blue road uniform. Chest numerals were added while a navy-brimmed red cap was used with the home uniform. The original \"Minnie and Paul\" logo returned to the left sleeve. Player names in red were added to the road uniform in 1977.<ref name=TwinsUniforms/>\n\nIn 1987, the Twins updated their look. Home white uniforms brought back the pinstripes along with the modern-day \"Twins\" script. By this time, the franchise felt it was established enough in the area that it could put a stylized \"M\" on its cap without having fans in St. Paul think it stood for Minneapolis. The \"TC\" insignia adorned the left sleeve, later replaced by the modern \"Minnie and Paul\" alternate in 2002. Road gray uniforms, which also featured pinstripes, were emblazoned with \"Minnesota\" in red block letters outlined in navy, while the updated primary logo adorned the left sleeve. Both uniforms kept the red numerals trimmed in navy, but the color on the player names was changed to navy. In 1997, player names were added to the home uniform. Initially, both uniforms were paired with an all-navy cap featuring the underlined \"M\" in front, but in 2002, the \"TC\" cap was brought back as a home cap while the \"M\" cap was used on the road. The \"M\" cap was retired following the 2010 season, though the team continued to wear them as a throwback on special occasions.<ref name=TwinsUniforms/>\n\nFor a few games during the 1997 season, the Twins wore red alternate uniforms, which featured navy piping and letters in white trimmed in navy. In that same year, the Twins also released a road navy alternate uniform, featuring red piping, \"Minnesota\" and player names in white block letters outlined in red, and red numerals outlined in white. The following season, the Twins replaced the red uniforms with a home navy alternate, which features the \"Twins\" script and back numerals in red outlined in white, and player names and chest numerals in white outlined in red. Both uniforms contained the \"TC\" (later modern \"Minnie and Paul\") and primary logo sleeve patches respectively. The Twins also brought back the navy-brimmed red cap for a few games with the home navy alternates. The road navy alternates remained in use until 2009, with the home navy version worn for the last time in the 2013 season.<ref name=TwinsUniforms/>\n\nThe Twins also wore three other alternate uniforms in the past. In 2006, the Twins wore a sleeveless variation of their regular home uniforms with navy undershirts, which they wore until 2010. They also wore a buttoned version of their 1973\u201386 home uniforms in 2009, before giving way to the throwback off-white version of their 1961\u201371 home uniforms from 2010 to 2018.<ref name=TwinsUniforms/>\n\nIn 2010, the Twins modified their road uniforms upon moving to Target Field. The pinstriped home uniforms remained, but the road primary now featured an updated \"Minnesota\" script (with an underline below \"innesot\") in red trimmed in navy. Letters are in navy while numerals (both on the chest and on the back) are in red trimmed in navy. The team's primary logo appears on the left sleeve. Meanwhile, the navy alternate road uniform shared the same look as the regular road uniforms, but with a few differences. The \"Minnesota\" script is in red outlined in white, letters and chest numerals are in white outlined in red, and back numerals are in red outlined in white. Red piping is also added. Both uniforms were paired with either the all-navy or the red-brimmed navy \"TC\" cap.<ref name=TwinsUniforms/>\n\nIn 2015, the Twins changed their home uniform. It features the modern \"Twins\" script (with an underline below \"win\") in navy outlined in red with Kasota gold drop shadows. Letters and numerals also take on the same color as the \"Twins\" script. The modern \"Minnie and Paul\" alternate logo (with the state of Minnesota in navy outlined in Kasota gold) appears on the left sleeve. Caps are in all-navy with the interlocking \"TC\" outlined in Kasota gold. The following year, they unveiled a red alternate uniform, which features the \"TC\" insignia outlined in Kasota gold on the left chest.

There was no acknowledgment of the Twins' prior championships in Washington and several Senator Hall of Famers, such as Walter Johnson, played in the days prior to numbers being used on uniforms. However, Killebrew played seven seasons as a Senator, including two full seasons as a regular prior to the move to Minnesota in 1961.\n\nPrior to the addition of the banners, the Twins acknowledged their retired numbers on the Metrodome's outfield fence. Harmon Killebrew's #3 was the first to be displayed, as it was the only one the team had retired when they moved in. It was joined by Rod Carew's #29 in 1987, Tony Oliva's #6 in 1991, Kent Hrbek's #14 in 1995, and Kirby Puckett's #34 in 1997 before the Twins began hanging the banners to reduce capacity. The championships, meanwhile, were marked on the \"Baggie\" in right field.\n\n{{retired number list|\n{{retired number|image=HarmonKillebrewTwins.png|name=[[Harmon Killebrew|Harmon<br />Killebrew]]|pos=LF-1B-3B|date=<br />May 4, 1975}}\n{{retired number|image=TonyOilvaTwins.png|name=[[Tony Oliva|Tony<br />Oliva]]|pos=RF-DH-Coach|date=July 14, 1991}}\n{{retired number|image=JoeMauerTwins.png|name=[[Joe Mauer|Joe<br />Mauer]]|pos=C-1B|date=June 15, 2019}}\n{{retired number|image=TomKellyTwins.png|name=[[Tom Kelly (baseball)|Tom<br />Kelly]]|pos=Manager|date=September 8, 2012}}\n{{retired number|image=KentHrbekTwins.png|name=[[Kent Hrbek|Kent<br />Hrbek]]|pos=1B|date=August 13, 1995}}\n{{retired number|image=BertBlylevenTwins.png|name=[[Bert Blyleven|Bert<br />Blyleven]]|pos=P|date=July 16, 2011}}\n{{retired number|image=RodCarewTwins.png|name=[[Rod Carew|Rod<br />Carew]]|pos=1B-2B|date=July 19, 1987}}\n{{retired number|image=KirbyPuckett_Twins.png||name=[[Kirby Puckett|Kirby<br />Puckett]]|pos=CF|date=May 25, 1997}}\n{{retired number|image=JimKaatTwins.png||name=[[Jim Kaat|Jim<br />Kaat]]|pos=P|date=July 16, 2022}}\n{{retired number|image=Minnesota_Twins_42.png|name=[[Jackie Robinson|Jackie<br />Robinson]]|pos=All MLB|honored=April 15, 1997}}\n}}\n[[File:Target Field 04.12.2010 059 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Target Field retired number signs in 2010.]] In the Metrodome, the numbers ran in that order from left to right. In Target Field, they run from right to left, presumably to allow space for additional numbers in the future. The retired numbers also serve as entry points at Target Field, The center field gate is Gate No. 3, honoring Killebrew, the left-field gate is Gate No. 6, honoring Oliva, the home plate gate is Gate No. 14, for Hrbek, the right field gate serves as Gate No. 29, in tribute to Carew, and the plaza gate is known as Gate No. 34, honoring Puckett.\n\nThe numbers that have been retired hang within Target Field in front of the tower that serves as the Twins' executive offices in left field foul territory. The championships banners have been replaced by small pennants that fly on masts at the back of the left-field upper deck. Those pennants, along with the flags flying in the plaza behind right field, serve as a visual cue for the players, suggesting the wind direction and speed.\n\n[[Jackie Robinson]]'s No. 42 was retired
