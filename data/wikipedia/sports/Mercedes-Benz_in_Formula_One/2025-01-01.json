The marque debuted in Formula One in {{F1|1954}}. After winning their first race at the [[1954 French Grand Prix]], driver [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] won another three Grands Prix to win the 1954 Drivers' Championship and repeated this success in {{F1|1955}}. Despite winning two Drivers' Championships, Mercedes-Benz withdrew from motor racing after 1955 in response to the [[1955 Le Mans disaster]].\n\nMercedes returned to Formula One in {{F1|1994}} as an engine manufacturer in association with [[Ilmor]], a British independent high-performance autosport engineering company, which developed their engines. The company won one constructors' title and three drivers' titles in a works partnership with [[McLaren]] which lasted until 2009. In 2005, Ilmor was rebranded as [[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains]]. In {{f1|2010}}, the company bought the [[Brawn GP]] team, rebranding it as Mercedes. Since a major rule shake-up in 2014, which required the use of [[turbocharger]]s and [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid electric engines]], Mercedes has become one of the most successful teams in Formula One history, winning seven consecutive Drivers' titles from {{F1|2014}} to {{F1|2020}} and eight consecutive Constructors' titles from {{F1|2014}} to {{f1|2021}}, both records. The manufacturer has also collected more than 200 wins as an engine supplier and is ranked second in Formula One history. Ten Constructors' and thirteen Drivers' Championships have been won with Mercedes-Benz engines.\n\n==Constructor==\n===Grand Prix racing before Formula One (1930s)===\n[[Mercedes-Benz]] formerly competed in [[Grand Prix motor racing]] in the 1930s, when the [[Silver Arrows]] dominated the races alongside rivals [[Auto Union]].
