In 1904, the ground was acquired by businessman [[Gus Mears]] and his brother [[Joseph Mears|Joseph]], who had purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5&nbsp;acre (51,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) site.<ref name=\"stadium\" /> Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], who had designed [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], [[Craven Cottage]] and [[Hampden Park]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |year=2006 |pages=69\u201371}}</ref> Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.\n\nStarting with an open bowl-like design and one grandstand with seating, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000, making it the second biggest stadium in England after [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]].<ref name=\"stadium\" /> The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around 20% of the stand.
