Chelsea won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1983\u201384 and established themselves in the top division with two top-six finishes, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988\u201389.\n\nAfter a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |year=2006 |pages=90\u201391}}</ref> In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman [[Matthew Harding]] became a director and loaned the club \u00a326&nbsp;million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players.<ref name=\"The battle of Stamford Bridge\">{{Cite news |date=11 November 1995 |title=The battle of Stamford Bridge |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-battle-of-stamford-bridge-1581435.html |url-status=live |access-date=20 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720111742/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-battle-of-stamford-bridge-1581435.html |archive-date=20 July 2019}}</ref> Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the [[1994 FA Cup Final]].

He added several top international players to the side and led the club to their first major honour since 1971, the [[1997 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]]. Gullit was replaced by [[Gianluca Vialli]], whose reign saw Chelsea win the [[1998 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]], the [[1998 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[1998 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup in 1998]], and the [[2000 FA Cup Final|FA Cup in 2000]]. They also mounted a strong title challenge in 1998\u201399, finishing four points behind champions Manchester United, and made their first appearance in the [[UEFA Champions League]].

In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman [[Gus Mears]] and his brother [[Joseph Mears|Joseph]], who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5&nbsp;acre (51,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) site.<ref name=\"stadium\" /> Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], who had also designed [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], [[Craven Cottage]] and [[Hampden Park]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |year=2006 |pages=69\u201371}}</ref> Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.\n\nStarting with an open bowl-like design and one grandstand with seating, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000, making it the second biggest stadium in England after [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]].<ref name=\"stadium\" /> The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around 20% of the stand.
