The Titans played their first four seasons at the stadium\u2014in the final season they were renamed the Jets. The Titans shared the stadium with [[Major League Baseball|baseball's]] new expansion team, the [[New York Mets]], for two years before both teams moved to [[Shea Stadium]] in Queens in 1964. The Jets hold the distinction of being the final team to host a game at the Polo Grounds, a 19\u201310 loss to the [[Buffalo Bills]] on December 14, 1963.<ref name=\"Polo Grounds\">Chastain, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nWismer hoped the then Titans could play in what would become known as [[Shea Stadium]] beginning in 1961.<ref name=\"Ryczek\">Ryczek, pp. 158\u2013159</ref> However, funding difficulties and legal problems delayed construction of the stadium.<ref name=\"Ryczek\"/> Wismer signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] in late 1961 to secure the Titans' new home.<ref name=\"Ryczek\"/> That memorandum recognized that the Mets would have exclusive use of the stadium until they had completed their season.

Litigation began between New York City and the Jets over the issue, and in the lawsuit's settlement, the city agreed to allow the Jets to play two September home games a season at Shea beginning in 1978 for the remaining six years in the Jets' lease. In 1977, the Jets were to play one September game at Giants Stadium and an October 2 game at Shea.<ref>{{cite news|title=Court Accord Keeps Football Jets at Shea Stadium|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/27/archives/court-accord-keeps-football-jets-at-shea-stadium-cards-set-back.html?sq=jets+giants+stadium+1978&scp=3&st=p|work=The New York Times|author1=Eskenazi, Gerald|author2=McGowen, Deane|date=May 27, 1977|access-date=November 10, 2010|archive-date=July 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723004447/https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/27/archives/court-accord-keeps-football-jets-at-shea-stadium-cards-set-back.html?sq=jets+giants+stadium+1978&scp=3&st=p|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of these issues, majority owner Leon Hess was interested in renewing the team's lease at Shea, which was due to expire in 1983.

The white jerseys had navy blue numerals. In 1961, the Titans added [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]]-style shoulder stripes (gold and white on the blue jerseys, gold and navy blue on the white jerseys), changed the pants striping to a blue stripe flanked by white stripes, and employed a somewhat brighter shade of gold.\n\nWhen the Titans became the Jets in 1963, navy and gold were abandoned in favor of kelly green and white. The jerseys had opposite-colored sleeves with thick stripes on the shoulders and cuffs, above and below the TV numerals, and the pants were white with two parallel green stripes on each side. The new helmets were white with a single green stripe down the center; the logo on each side was a silhouette of a jet airplane in green, with the word \"JETS\" in thick white sans-serif italics along the fuselage. In 1964 the single green center stripe became two parallel stripes, and the jet-plane decal was replaced with a white football shape outlined in green, with the word \"JETS\" in thick green sans-serif italics in front of \"NY\" in green outline serif lettering, and a miniature football at bottom center. The decals were difficult to see from a distance (or on television), so the colors were reversed and the decals slightly enlarged in 1965.  This design remained largely unchanged through 1977, apart from some variations to the numeral and lettering typefaces, the angle of the helmet decals, and adjustments to the shoulder and sleeve striping due to changes in NFL jersey tailoring and materials.\n[[Image:Heidi Game program.jpg|thumb|200px|1968 game program showing the 1965-77 helmet and primary logo.

The kelly green and white color scheme was retained; the new helmets were solid green with white facemasks, no stripes, and a stylized \"JETS\" wordmark in white on each side. The mark featured angular lettering and a silhouette of a modern jet airplane extending horizontally to the right from the top of the \"J\" above the \"ETS\". The jerseys featured large TV numerals on the shoulders and two thick parallel stripes on the sleeves, while the pants had a single green stripe from hip to knee on each side. In 1990 the Jets modified this design by adding thin black outlines to the numerals, lettering, stripes, and helmet decals, changing the facemasks from white to black, and adding a set of green pants and white socks to be worn with the white jerseys.\n\nThe Jets were the first NFL team to wear a [[Throwback uniform|\"throwback\"]] uniform, in [[1993 New York Jets season|1993]] for a home game against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] celebrating the 25th anniversary of the [[1968 New York Jets season|1968 championship team]]. The jersey and pants mimicked the 1963\u201377 design, although the team wore its regular green helmets with a white-outlined version of the 1965\u201377 logo decal. In [[1994 New York Jets season|1994]], as part of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s 75th Anniversary celebration, the Jets wore both home and road versions of this uniform in select games, again using their regular green helmets with the 1965\u201377 logo but with two parallel white stripes down the center.\n\n[[Image:Jets uniforms12.png|thumb|left|200px|The team's uniform design used from 1998 to 2018, a modern version of its 1965\u201377 design.]]\nThe Jets adopted a new uniform and logo design in 1998, a modernization of the 1965\u201377 set with a darker hunter green replacing the bright kelly green, and the primary logo now oval rather than football-shaped and updated with starker lines. Green pants and striped white socks were added in 2002, and were worn with both the white and green jerseys.\n\nIn [[2007 New York Jets season|2007]] the Jets introduced a new \"throwback\" uniform evoking the original Titans of New York and combining elements of the 1960 and 1961\u201362 uniforms, with navy blue helmets and jerseys, old gold numerals and helmet stripes, gold and white shoulder stripes, and gold pants with blue and white stripes on each side. These uniforms appeared again in [[2008 New York Jets season|2008]], [[2009 New York Jets season|2009]] and [[2011 New York Jets season|2011]], with a white-jersey variation also appearing in 2009 as part of the NFL's celebration of the [[American Football League]]'s 50th anniversary.\n\nThe Jets abandoned their classic look for a second time in 2019, with a new uniform design featuring a medium shade of green which the franchise calls \"Gotham Green,\" reincorporating black as a third/trim color, and reverting to green helmets with a metallic paint finish and black facemasks.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Landis|first1=Olivia|last2=Allen|first2=Eric|last3=Lange|first3=Randy|title=Take Flight: New Jets Uniforms Another Symbol of a New Era|url=https://www.newyorkjets.com/news/take-flight-new-jets-uniforms-another-symbol-of-a-new-era|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NewYorkJets.com|date=April 4, 2019|access-date=April 5, 2019|quote=Three new colors: Gotham Green, Spotlight White and Stealth Black|archive-date=August 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190809223101/https://www.newyorkjets.com/news/take-flight-new-jets-uniforms-another-symbol-of-a-new-era|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introducing the Next Generation of Jets Football|url=https://www.newyorkjets.com/team/new-uniforms|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NewYorkJets.com|date=April 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406113313/https://www.newyorkjets.com/team/new-uniforms|archive-date=April 6, 2019|access-date=January 28, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Bergman|first=Jeremy|title=New York Jets unveil new uniforms, green helmets|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001025415/article/new-york-jets-unveil-new-uniforms-green-helmets|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=April 4, 2019|access-date=April 5, 2019|quote=For the first time in over 20 years, the New York Jets will take the field with a new look, to go with their new head coach and high-priced free agents.

The primary logo reverted to a football shape, and eliminated the background \"NY\" initials in favor of \"NEW YORK\" in sans-serif italics above \"JETS\" which was modified to make the \"J\" the same height as the other letters and moved slightly downward, with the revised football graphic now covering the lower portion of the letters \"E\" and \"T\"; the helmet decal was a secondary logo featuring only the \"JETS\" wordmark and football. The team also introduced a black alternate uniform with green striping and white numerals outlined in green. In 2022, with league rule changes allowing for a second helmet shell, the black uniform was paired with a matte-black alternate helmet with a metallic-green facemask and the \"JETS\" logo in green outlined in white.\n\nIn 2023 the Jets introduced a \"legacy white\" throwback uniform resembling the 1978\u201389 design, then announced at the end of the season that this would become the team's primary uniform in 2024, with green and black versions added to complete the set.<ref name=\"JetsLegacyUnis2024\" /><ref name=\"NewNYJetsUnis2024\" />  For this rebrand the 1978 \"JETS\" logo was slightly modified to condense the spacing between the letters, and to widen the tail and streamline the nose of the jet-plane silhouette.  The primary uniforms resemble the 1978\u201389 design in most respects, although the \"Gotham Green\" shade and metallic-finish helmet shells were carried over and the set includes a green pants option; the black alternates apply the same color scheme as the outgoing set to the new template.\n\n==Cheerleading squad==\n{{Main|Jets Flight Crew}}\n[[File:JetBlue Jets.jpg|thumb|JetBlue honors the NY Jets with its green plane.]]\nThe original Jets Flag Crew was established in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Shorenstein, Marissa|title=Wave Hello to New Flag Carriers|url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/news/article-1/Wave-Hello-to-New-Flag-Carriers/4c95f25c-79f7-11df-ba56-acc8e62813e9|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NewYorkJets.com|date=October 22, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228112146/http://www.newyorkjets.com/news/article-1/Wave-Hello-to-New-Flag-Carriers/4c95f25c-79f7-11df-ba56-acc8e62813e9|archive-date=December 28, 2010|access-date=March 15, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2007, the group underwent an expansion and was renamed the Jets Flight Crew.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jets' Flight Crew Set for Takeoff|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2007/08/08/2007-08-08_jets_flight_crew_set_for_takeoff.html|work=New York Daily News|date=August 8, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604073255/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2007/08/08/2007-08-08_jets_flight_crew_set_for_takeoff.html|archive-date=June 4, 2011|access-date=October 15, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The squad regularly performs choreographed routines during the team's home contests.
