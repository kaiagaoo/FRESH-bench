The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before.\n\nWhen [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over from [[Adidas]] as Arsenal's kit provider in 1994, Arsenal's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001\u201302 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Arsenal/Arsenal-change-kits.html\n| title=Arsenal Change Kits\n| work=Historical Football Kits\n| publisher=D & M Moor\n| access-date=27 November 2009\n}}</ref>\nUntil 2014, the away kit was changed every season, and the outgoing away kit became the third-choice kit if a new home kit was being introduced in the same year.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.arsenal.com/the-club/corporate-info/the-club-charter\n| title=Club Charter\n| publisher=Arsenal F.C\n| access-date=23 October 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nSince [[Puma SE|Puma]] began manufacturing Arsenal's kits in 2014, new home, away and third kits were released every single season. In the 2017\u201318 season, Puma released a new color scheme for the away and third kits.

Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and [[terrace (stadium)|terracing]], upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894\u201395 season), until the move to north London in 1913.<ref>{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Inglis |title=Football Grounds of Britain |orig-year=1985 |edition=3rd |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |location=London |isbn=0-00-218426-5 |pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Suspension of the Plumstead Ground |newspaper=The Times |date=7 February 1895 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nWidely referred to as Highbury, [[Arsenal Stadium]] was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.<ref name=\"conservation_plan\"/> The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new [[Art Deco]] West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.<ref name=\"conservation_plan\"/>\n\nHighbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993\u201394 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=The+Club&article=344883&Title=Highbury |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223345/http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=The+Club&article=344883&Title=Highbury |archive-date=11 January 2008 |title=Highbury |publisher=Arsenal F.C |url-status=dead}}</ref> This capacity had to be reduced further during [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], which could house more than 70,000 spectators.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/138932.stm | title=Arsenal get Wembley go-ahead |work=BBC Sport | date=24 July 1998 | access-date=11 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arsenal Stadium interior North Bank.jpg|thumb|right|The North Bank Stand, [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]]|alt=A grandstand at a sports stadium.

Much of the Afro-Caribbean support comes from the neighbouring [[London Borough of Hackney]] and a large portion of the South Asian Arsenal supporters commute to the stadium from [[Wembley Park]], North West of the capital. There was also traditionally a large Irish community that followed Arsenal, with the nearby [[Archway, London|Archway]] area having a particularly large community, but Irish migration to North London is much lower than in the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nLike all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters' Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains a more independent line. The [[Arsenal Supporters' Trust]] promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Gunflash'' and the satirical ''Up The Arse!''. In addition to the usual English [[football chant]]s, supporters sing \"One-Nil to the Arsenal\" (to the tune of \"[[Go West (song)|Go West]]\").\n\nThere have always been Arsenal supporters outside London, and since the advent of satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography.
