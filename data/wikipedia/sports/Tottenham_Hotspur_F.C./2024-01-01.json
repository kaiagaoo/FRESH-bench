It competes in the [[Premier League]], the top flight of [[English football league system|English football]]. The team has played its home matches in the 62,850-capacity [[Tottenham Hotspur Stadium]] since April 2019, replacing their former home of [[White Hart Lane]], which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site.\n\nFounded in 1882, Tottenham's [[emblem]] is a [[Cockfight|cockerel]] standing upon a football, with the Latin [[motto]] ''Audere est Facere'' (\"to dare is to do\"). The club has traditionally worn white shirts and navy blue shorts as their home kit since the 1898\u201399 season. Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in [[Bulls Cross]], [[Enfield, London|Enfield]]. After its inception, Tottenham won the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1900\u201301 FA Cup|1901]], the only [[non-League football|non-League]] club to do so since the formation of [[English Football League|the Football League]] in 1888.
