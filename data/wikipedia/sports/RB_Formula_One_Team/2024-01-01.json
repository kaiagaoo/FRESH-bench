It is one of two Formula One constructors owned by Austrian conglomerate [[Red Bull GmbH]], the other being [[Red Bull Racing]]. The constructor was rebranded for the [[2024 Formula One World Championship]] from \"[[Scuderia AlphaTauri]]\" to \"Racing Bulls\" as part of a management and corporate identity restructure.\n\n==Origins==\n{{See also| Minardi|Scuderia Toro Rosso|Scuderia AlphaTauri}}\nThe team's involvement in Formula One started in the [[1985 Formula One World Championship|1985 season]] when they first competed as [[Minardi]]. The team has been owned by [[Red Bull GmbH]] since the [[2006 Formula One World Championship|2006 season]], when they became Scuderia Toro Rosso. It was announced on 1 December 2019 that the team had selected \"AlphaTauri\" as a new moniker to promote parent company Red Bull's  [[AlphaTauri (fashion brand)|fashion label of the same name]]. Thus, they became Scuderia AlphaTauri and retired the Scuderia Toro Rosso moniker after fourteen years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2019/09/29/toro-rosso-to-be-renamed-alphatauri-for-2020/|title=Toro Rosso to be renamed AlphaTauri for 2020|first=Mat|last=Coch|work=[[speedcafe]].com|date=29 September 2019|access-date=29 September 2019}}</ref> They again transitioned to a new name, \"Racing Bulls\", for the 2024 season.{{citation needed|date=December 2024}}\n\n==Racing history==\n{{further|2024 Formula One World Championship|Chassis Link}}\n\n==Complete Formula One results==\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--* {{Official website}}-->\n\n{{Formula One teams}}\n{{Formula One constructors}}\n{{Red Bull}}\n\n[[:Category:Formula One entrants]]\n[[:Category:Red Bull sports clubs and teams]]\n[[:Category:Auto racing teams in Italy]]\n[[:Category:Italian racecar constructors]]\n[[:Category:2024 establishments in Italy]]\n[[:Category:Auto racing teams established in 2024]]"}
