The Orioles compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League East|East Division]]. As one of the American League's eight charter teams in 1901, the franchise spent its first year as a major league club in [[Milwaukee]] as the '''[[Milwaukee Brewers (1894\u20131901)|Milwaukee Brewers]]''' before moving to [[St. Louis]] to become the '''[[St. Louis Browns]]''' in 1902. After 52 years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests, led by attorney and civic activist [[Clarence Miles]] and Mayor [[Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.]] The team's current owner is [[David Rubenstein]]. The Orioles' home [[ballpark]] is [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], which opened in 1992 in [[downtown Baltimore]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/ct-camden-yards-wrigley-field-spt-0504-20170503-story.html |title=Camden Yards paved a retro revolution \u2014 and influenced Wrigley Field's renovations |first=Blair |last=Kamin |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date=April 15, 2019 |archive-date=April 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418010019/https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/ct-camden-yards-wrigley-field-spt-0504-20170503-story.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.citypaper.com/news/features/bcp-040517-feature-a-more-complex-legacy-oriole-park-25th-anniversary-html-htmlstory.html |title=A More Complex Legacy: Oriole Park is known as \"the ballpark that forever changed baseball\", and its impact may well extend to local governing |first=Brandon |last=Weigel |work=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |access-date=April 15, 2019 |archive-date=April 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418010010/https://www.citypaper.com/news/features/bcp-040517-feature-a-more-complex-legacy-oriole-park-25th-anniversary-html-htmlstory.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> \nThe oriole is the [[Baltimore oriole|official state bird of Maryland]]; the name has been used by several baseball clubs in the city, including another AL charter member franchise which moved to New York in 1903 and became the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]. [[List of baseball nicknames|Nicknames]] for the team include the \"'''O's'''\" and the \"'''Birds'''\".\n\nThe franchise's first [[World Series]] appearance came in [[1944 World Series|1944]] when the Browns lost to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. The Orioles went on to make six World Series appearances from 1966 to 1983, winning three in [[1966 World Series|1966]], [[1970 World Series|1970]], and [[1983 World Series|1983]]. This era of the club featured several future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] who would later be inducted representing the Orioles, such as third baseman [[Brooks Robinson]], outfielder [[Frank Robinson]], starting pitcher [[Jim Palmer]], first baseman [[Eddie Murray]], shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr.]], and manager [[Earl Weaver]]. The Orioles have won a total of ten division championships (1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1979, 1983, 1997, 2014, 2023), seven [[American League Championship Series|pennants]] (1944 while in St. Louis, 1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979, 1983), and three [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] berths (1996, 2012, 2016). The franchise was the last charter member of the American League to win a pennant, and the last charter member to win a World Series.\n\nAfter 14 consecutive losing seasons between 1998 and 2011, the team qualified for the postseason three times under manager [[Buck Showalter]] and general manager [[Dan Duquette]], including a division title and advancement to the [[American League Championship Series]] for the first time in 17 years in [[2014 Baltimore Orioles season|2014]]. [[2018 Baltimore Orioles season|Four years later]], the Orioles lost 115 games, the most in franchise history.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bs-sp-orioles-worst-team-in-sports-20181231-story.html |title=Orioles rated as worst team in all of sports in 2018 |first=Jon |last=Meoli |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=December 31, 2018 |access-date=May 6, 2019}}</ref> The Orioles chose not to renew the expired contracts of Showalter and Duquette after the season, ending their respective tenures with Baltimore.

The Brewers were there when the Western League renamed itself the [[American League]] in 1900.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers (1901)===\n{{main|Milwaukee Brewers (1894-1901)}}\nAt the end of the 1900 season, the American League removed itself from baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the NL and the minor leagues). Two months later, the AL declared itself a competing major league. As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were one of only two Western League teams that didn't fold, move or get kicked out of the league (the other being the [[Detroit Tigers]]). In its first game in the American League, the team lost to the [[1901 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] 14\u201313 after surrendering a nine-run lead in the 9th inning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1901/04251901.htm |title=Events of Thursday, April 25, 1901 |publisher=Retrosheet.org |date=April 25, 1902 |access-date=November 23, 2012}}</ref> To this day, it is a major league record for the biggest deficit overcome that late in the game.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/baseballs-biggest-ninth-inning-comebacks-385/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Baseball's Biggest Ninth-Inning Comebacks | first=Carl | last=Bialik | date=July 28, 2008}}</ref> In the first American League season in 1901, they finished last (eighth place) with a record of 48\u201389. During its lone Major League season, the team played at [[Lloyd Street Grounds]], between 16th and 18th Streets in Milwaukee.\n\n===St. Louis Browns (1902\u20131953)===\n{{main|St. Louis Browns}}\n\nAfter one year in Milwaukee, the club relocated to St Louis, and for a while enjoyed some success, especially in the 1920s behind [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] first baseman [[George Sisler]]. However, the team's fortunes declined from then on, as playing success and gate receipts instead went increasingly to the Browns' own tenants at [[Sportsman's Park]], the National League [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]], who became perennial NL contenders in the 1920s due to organizational innovations by team president [[Branch Rickey]], a former player and manager for the Browns.\n\nThrough [[World War II]], the Browns won only one pennant, in the [[1944 St. Louis Browns season|1944 season]] stocked with wartime replacement players and lost to the [[1944 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] in the third and last [[1944 World Series|World Series]] played entirely in one ballpark (until [[2020 World Series|2020]] due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]]).\n\nIn [[1953 St. Louis Browns season|1953]], with the Browns unable to afford even basic stadium upkeep and facing potential condemnation of the park by safety inspectors, owner [[Bill Veeck]] sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals and attempted to move the club back to Milwaukee, but this was vetoed by the other American League owners.\n\nInstead, Veeck sold his franchise to a partnership of Baltimore businessmen. Because Veeck was unpopular with fellow American League owners, his leaving baseball was a condition for the AL owners to approve the move.<ref>[https://bleacherreport.com/articles/307819-st-louis-browns-1902-1953 St. Louis Browns: 1902\u20131953], ''Bleacher Report'', Andrew Godfrey. \"In 1953 Veeck would request to move the team to Baltimore but the move was approved on the condition Veeck would give up his interest in the team{{nbsp}}...\"</ref><ref>''Team First: History of Baseball Integration & Civil Rights'', Lloyd H.

The nickname has a rich history in Baltimore, having been used by a [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|National League club]] in the 1890s, an [[History of the New York Yankees#Background: 1901\u20131902 Baltimore Orioles|American League club]] (1901\u201302), and an [[Baltimore Orioles (International League)|International League club]] (AAA) from 1903 to 1953. The IL Orioles' most famous player was a local Baltimore product, hard-hitting left-handed pitcher [[Babe Ruth]]. When Oriole Park burned down in 1944, the team moved to a temporary home, [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Municipal Stadium]], where they won the Junior World Series. Their large postseason crowds caught the attention of the major leagues, eventually leading to a new MLB franchise in Baltimore.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Baseball in Baltimore|last=Flynn|first=Tom|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7385-5325-2|location=Maryland|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5iTozrMruwC&pg=PA67}}</ref>\n\n====First years in Baltimore (1954\u20131965)====\nThe new AL Orioles took about six years to become competitive even after jettisoning most of the holdovers from St. Louis.  Under the guidance of [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]], who served as both field manager and [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] from [[1955 Baltimore Orioles season|1955]] to [[1958 Baltimore Orioles season|1958]] (the first man since [[John McGraw]] to hold both positions simultaneously),<ref name=\"A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances\">{{cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065155/index.htm |title=A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref> the Orioles began a slow climb to respectability.  While they posted a .500 record only once in their first five years (76\u201376 in {{Baseball year|1957}}), they were a success at the gate. In their first season, for instance, they drew more than 1.06 million fans \u2013 more than five times what they had ever drawn in their tenures in Milwaukee and St. Louis. This came amid slight turnover in the ownership group. Miles served as team president for two years, then stepped down in favor of developer [[James Keelty]]. In turn, Keelty gave way in {{Baseball year|1960}} to financier [[Joe Iglehart]].\n\nBy the early 1960s, stars such as [[Brooks Robinson]], [[Boog Powell|John \"Boog\" Powell]], and [[Dave McNally]] were being developed by a strong farm system. The Orioles first made themselves heard in {{Baseball year|1960}}, when they finished 89\u201365, good enough for second in the American League. While they were still eight games behind the Yankees, it was the first time they had been a factor in a pennant race that late in the season since 1944. It was also the first season of a 26-year stretch where the team would have only two losing seasons. Shortstop [[Ron Hansen (baseball)|Ron Hansen]] was named AL [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]], and first-year pitcher [[Chuck Estrada]] tied for the league lead in wins with 18, finishing second to Hansen in the Rookie of the Year balloting.\n\nAfter the [[1965 in baseball|1965 season]], Hoffberger acquired controlling interest in the Orioles from Iglehart and installed himself as president. He had been serving as a silent partner over the past decade despite being the largest shareholder. [[Frank Cashen]], advertising chief of Hoffberger's brewery, became executive vice-president.\n\n====Best years in Baltimore (1966\u20131983)====\n[[File:Antonio Tobias Mendez.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frank Robinson]] statue by [[Antonio Tobias Mendez]]]]\nThe Orioles farm system had begun to produce a number of high-quality players and coaches who formed the core of winning teams; from 1966 to [[1983 in baseball|1983]], the Orioles won three World Series titles ([[1966 World Series|1966]], [[1970 World Series|1970]], and [[1983 World Series|1983]]), six American League pennants ([[1966 in baseball|1966]], [[1969 in baseball|1969]], [[1970 in baseball|1970]], [[1971 in baseball|1971]], [[1979 in baseball|1979]], and [[1983 in baseball|1983]]), and five of the first six [[American League East]] titles. The first of those titles, in 1966, made the Orioles the last of the eight teams that made up the American League from 1903 to 1960 to win a World Series.\n\nDuring this time, the Orioles were known for playing baseball the '''''Oriole Way''''', an organizational ethic best described by longtime farm hand and coach [[Cal Ripken, Sr.]]'s phrase ''\"'''perfect''' practice makes perfect!\"'' The Oriole Way was a belief that hard work, professionalism, and a strong understanding of fundamentals were the keys to success at the major league level. It was based on the belief that if every coach, at every level, taught the game the same way, the organization could produce \"replacement parts\" that could be substituted seamlessly into the big-league club with little or no adjustment. This led to a run of success from 1966 to 1983 which saw the Orioles become the envy of the league, and the winningest team in baseball.\n\nDuring this stretch, three different Orioles were named [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] ([[Frank Robinson]] in 1966, [[Boog Powell]] in 1970, and [[Cal Ripken Jr.]] in 1983), four Oriole pitchers combined for six [[Cy Young Award]]s ([[Mike Cuellar]] in 1969, [[Jim Palmer]] in 1973, 1975, and 1976, [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] in 1979, and [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] in 1980), and three players were named [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] ([[Al Bumbry]] in 1973, [[Eddie Murray]] in 1977, and [[Cal Ripken Jr.]] in 1982).\n\nIt was also during this time that the Orioles severed their last remaining financial link to their era in St. Louis.  In 1979, Hoffberger sold the Orioles to his longtime friend, Washington attorney [[Edward Bennett Williams]].  As part of the deal, Williams bought the publicly traded shares Donald Barnes had issued in 1936 while the team was still in St. Louis, making the franchise privately held once again and severing one of the few remaining links with the Orioles' past in St. Louis.\n\nDuring this rise to prominence, ''Weaver Ball'' came into vogue. Named for fiery manager [[Earl Weaver]], it was defined by the Oriole trifecta of ''\"Pitching, Defense, and the Three-Run Home Run.\"'' When an Oriole GM was told by a reporter that Weaver, as the skipper of a very talented team, was a \"push-button manager\", he replied, ''\"Earl built the machine and installed all the buttons!\"''\n\nAs Frank and Brooks Robinson grew older, newer stars emerged, including multiple Cy Young Award winner Jim Palmer and switch-hitting first baseman [[Eddie Murray]]. With the decline and eventual departure of two other professional sports teams in the area, the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Baltimore Colts]] and baseball's [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]], the Orioles' excellence paid off at the gate, as the team cultivated a large and rabid fan base at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====Final seasons at Memorial Stadium (1984\u20131991)====\n[[Image:Baltimore Memorial Stadium 1991.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Orioles hosting one of the final games at Memorial Stadium in 1991]]\n\nAfter winning the [[1983 World Series]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/orioles-1983-world-series-season-highlights-memories|title=Baltimore bid goodbye to Earl Weaver, then won a World Series|last=Silver|first=Zachary|date=February 28, 2022|website=MLB.com|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|access-date=February 28, 2022}}</ref> the Orioles spent the next five years in steady decline, finishing 1986 in last place for the first time since the franchise moved to Baltimore. The [[1988 Baltimore Orioles season|1988 team]] started the season 0\u201321, en route to 107 losses and the worst record in the major leagues that year. The \"Why Not?\" Orioles surprised the baseball world the following year by spending most of the summer in first place until September when the [[1989 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] overtook them and seized the AL East title on the final weekend of the regular season. The next two years were spent below the .500 mark, highlighted only by Cal Ripken Jr. winning his second [[AL MVP Award]] in 1991. The [[1991 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] said goodbye to Memorial Stadium, the team's home for 38&nbsp;years, at the end of the 1991 campaign.\n\n====Camden Yards opens and Ripken's record (1992\u20131995)====\n{{main|1992 Baltimore Orioles season|1993 Baltimore Orioles season}}\n\nOpening to much fanfare in 1992, [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] was an instant success, inspiring other retro-style major league ballparks in the next decades. The stadium was the site of the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star Game]]. The Orioles returned to contention in the first two seasons at Camden Yards, only to finish in third place both times.\n\nIn 1993, with owner [[Eli Jacobs]] forced to divest himself of the franchise, Baltimore-based attorney [[Peter Angelos]], along with the ownership syndicate he headed, was awarded the Orioles in [[United States bankruptcy court|bankruptcy court]] in New York City, returning the team to local ownership for the first time since 1979. Angelos's partners included author [[Tom Clancy]] and comic book distributor [[Steve Geppi]].<ref>{{cite news |title=THE ORIOLES' NEW OWNERS |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/horse-racing/bal-mckay100593-story.html |access-date=December 26, 2022 |work=Baltimore Sun}}</ref> The Orioles, who spent all of 1994 chasing the [[1994 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], occupied second place in the new five-team AL East when the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players strike]], which began on August 11, forced the eventual cancellation of the season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BAL/1994.shtml|title=1994 Baltimore Orioles season summary|publisher=Baseball-Reference.Com|access-date=May 15, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2131 on the warehouse wall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The numbers on the Orioles' warehouse changed from 2130 to 2131 to celebrate Cal Ripken Jr. passing Lou Gehrig's consecutive games played streak.]]\nThe labor impasse continued into the spring of 1995. Almost all the major league clubs held spring training using [[strikebreaker|replacement players]], with the intention of beginning the [[1995 Major League Baseball season|season]] with them. The Orioles, whose owner was a labor union lawyer, were the lone dissenters against creating an ersatz team, choosing instead to sit out spring training and possibly the entire season. Had they fielded a substitute team, [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]'s consecutive games streak would have been jeopardized. The replacements questions became moot when the strike was finally settled. The Ripken countdown resumed once the season began. Ripken finally broke [[Lou Gehrig]]'s consecutive games streak of 2,130&nbsp;games in a nationally televised game against the California Angels on September 6.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/when-cal-ripken-jr-broke-lou-gehrigs-record-for-consecutive-games-played/2018/08/27/9f41735c-8f62-11e8-8322-b5482bf5e0f5_story.html|title=When Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played|last=Shin|first=Annys|date=August 30, 2018|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=August 30, 2018}}</ref> This was later voted the all-time baseball moment of the 20th century by fans from around the country in 1999.

Given the approval to spend heavily on established talent, Gillick signed several premium players like [[B. J. Surhoff]], [[Randy Myers]], [[David Wells]] and [[Roberto Alomar]]. Under new manager [[Davey Johnson]] and on the strength of a then-major league record 257 home runs in a single season, the Orioles returned to the playoffs after a 12-year absence by clinching the AL wild card berth. Alomar set off a firestorm in September when he spat into home plate umpire [[John Hirschbeck]]'s face during an argument in Toronto. He was later suspended for the first five games of the 1997 season, even though most wanted him banned from the postseason. After dethroning the defending American League champion [[1996 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] 3\u20131 in the [[1996 American League Division Series|Division Series]], the Orioles fell to the [[1996 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] 4\u20131 in an [[1996 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] notable for right field umpire [[Rich Garcia]]'s failure to call fan interference in the first game of the series, when 12-year-old Yankee fan [[Jeffrey Maier]] reached over the outfield wall to catch an in-play ball, which was scored as a home run for [[Derek Jeter]], tying the game at 4\u20134 in the eighth inning. Absent Maier's interference, it appeared as if the ball might have been off the wall or caught by right fielder [[Tony Tarasco]]. The Yankees went on to win the game in extra innings on an ensuing walk-off home run by Bernie Williams.\n\nThe Orioles went \"wire-to-wire\" (first place from start to finish) in winning the AL East title in 1997. After eliminating the [[1997 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] 3\u20131 in the [[1997 American League Division Series|Division Series]], the team lost again in the [[1997 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], this time to the underdog [[1997 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] 4\u20132, with each Oriole loss by only a run. Johnson resigned as manager after the season, largely due to a spat with Angelos concerning Alomar's fine for missing a team function being donated to Johnson's wife's charity.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/orioles/longterm/memories/davey/articles/poorcomm.htm | newspaper=The Washington Post|title=Poor Communication at Heart of Feud | date=May 12, 1998}}</ref> Pitching coach [[Ray Miller (baseball manager)|Ray Miller]] replaced Johnson.\n\n====Downturn (1998\u20132006)====\nWith Miller at the helm, the Orioles found themselves not only out of the playoffs, but also with a losing season. When Gillick's contract expired in 1998, it was not renewed. Angelos brought in [[Frank Wren]] to take over as GM. The Orioles added volatile slugger [[Albert Belle]], but the team's woes continued in the 1999 season, with stars like [[Rafael Palmeiro]], [[Roberto Alomar]], and [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] leaving in free agency. After a second straight losing season, Angelos fired both Miller and Wren. He named [[Syd Thrift]] the new GM and brought in former Cleveland manager [[Mike Hargrove]]. In a rare event on March 28, 1999, the Orioles staged an [[1999 Baltimore Orioles \u2013 Cuban national baseball team exhibition series|exhibition series]] against the [[Cuba national baseball team|Cuban national team]] in [[Havana]]. The Orioles won the game 3\u20132 in 11 innings. They were the first Major League team to play in Cuba since 1959, when the [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] faced the [[1959 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] in an exhibition. The Cuban team visited Baltimore in May 1999 (winning 10\u20136).\n\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century, the Orioles struggled due to the combination of lackluster play on the team's part, a string of ineffective management, and the ascent of New York and Boston to the top of the game \u2013 each rival having a clear advantage in financial flexibility due to their larger media market size. Further complicating the situation for the Orioles was the relocation of the [[National League (baseball)|National League]]'s [[Montreal Expos]] franchise to nearby Washington, D.C., in 2004. Orioles owner Peter Angelos demanded compensation from [[Major League Baseball]], as the new [[Washington Nationals]] threatened to carve into the Orioles fan base and television dollars. However, there was some hope that having competition in the larger Baltimore-Washington metro market would spur the Orioles to field a better product to compete for fans with the Nationals.\n\n====Rebuilding years and arrival of Buck Showalter (2007\u20132011)====\nA new President of Baseball of Operations named [[Andy MacPhail]] was brought in about halfway through the 2007 season. MacPhail spent the remainder of the 2007 season assessing the talent level of the Orioles and determined that significant steps needed to be made if the Orioles were ever to be a contender again in the American League East.  He completed two blockbuster trades during the next off-season, each sending a premium player away in return for five prospects (or younger less expensive players).  Tejada, who had hit .296 with 18 HR and 81 RBI in 2007, went to the Houston Astros in exchange for outfielder [[Luke Scott (baseball)|Luke Scott]], pitchers [[Matt Albers]], [[Troy Patton]], and [[Dennis Sarfate]], and third baseman [[Mike Costanzo]].  Also, the newly designated ace of the Orioles rotation [[\u00c9rik B\u00e9dard]], who went 13\u20135 with a 3.16 ERA in 2007 with 221 strikeouts, was sent to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for top outfield prospect [[Adam Jones (baseball)|Adam Jones]], left-handed pitcher [[George Sherrill]], and three minor league pitchers [[Chris Tillman]], [[Kam Mickolio]], and [[Tony Butler (baseball)|Tony Butler]].  The Bedard trade in particular would go down as one of the most lop-sided and successful trades in the history of the franchise.\n[[File:Orioles Win May 13 2010.JPG|thumb|The Orioles celebrate a 6\u20135 victory over the Mariners at Camden Yards on May 13, 2010.]]\nWhile MacPhail would find success in most of his trades made for the Orioles over the long-term, the veteran stop acquisitions that he would make would not often pan out, and as a result, the team would never finish higher than 4th place in the AL East, or with more than 69 wins, while MacPhail was in charge.  Although some of his free agent signings would have positive contributions (such as reliever [[Koji Uehara]]), most gave mediocre returns, at best.  In particular, the Orioles never managed to cobble together a successful pitching staff during this time.  Their most consistent starting pitcher from 2008 to 2011 was the late bloomer [[Jeremy Guthrie]] who was named the Opening Day starter in three of the four seasons and had a cumulative 4.12 ERA during this stretch.\n\nFollowing Davey Johnson's dismissal after the 1997 playoff season, Orioles ownership struggled to find a manager that they liked, and this time period was no exception. [[Dave Trembley]] was brought on as an interim manager in June 2007, and had the interim tag removed later that year.  Trembley was at the helm again in 2008 and 2009 but was never able to lead the team out of the cellar in the AL East.  After starting the 2010 season with a 15\u201339 record, Dave Trembley was fired and third base coach [[Juan Samuel]] was named the interim manager.  The Orioles were seeking a more permanent solution at manager as the 2010 season continued to unfold, and two-time AL Manager of the Year [[Buck Showalter]] was hired in July 2010.  The Orioles went 34\u201323 after Showalter took over, foreshadowing that a brighter future might be on the horizon, and giving Orioles fans renewed hope and optimism for the team's future.\n\nThe Orioles made some aggressive moves to improve the team in 2011 in the hopes of securing their first playoff berth since 1997.  [[Andy MacPhail]] completed trades to bring in established veterans like [[Mark Reynolds (baseball)|Mark Reynolds]] and [[J. J. Hardy]] from the Diamondbacks and Twins, respectively.  Veteran free agents [[Derrek Lee]] and [[Vladimir Guerrero]] were also brought in to help improve the offense.   At the 2011 trade deadline, fan favorite [[Koji Uehara]] was sent to the Texas Rangers in exchange for [[Chris Davis (baseball)|Chris Davis]] and [[Tommy Hunter (baseball)|Tommy Hunter]], a move that would not pay immediate dividends, but would be crucial to the team's later success.  While these moves had varying impacts, the Orioles did score 95 more runs in 2011 than they had the previous year. The team still finished last in the AL East due to the utter failures of the team's pitching staff.  [[Brian Matusz]] compiled one of the highest single-season ERAs in MLB history (10.69 over 12 starts) and every pitcher who started a game for the Orioles in 2011 ended the season with an ERA of 4.50 or higher except for [[Jeremy Guthrie]].  The Orioles finished 30th out of 30 MLB teams that year with a 4.89 team ERA. Andy MacPhail's contract was not renewed in October 2011 and a search for a new GM began.  After a public interview process where several candidates declined to take the position, ex-GM [[Dan Duquette]] was brought in to serve as the Executive Vice-President of Baseball Operations.\n\n====Return to success under Showalter (2012\u20132016)====\nDuquette overhauled the Orioles roster, especially the MLB-worst pitching staff.  He traded fan favorite [[Jeremy Guthrie]] to the Colorado Rockies in exchange for [[Jason Hammel]].  He brought in new free agent starting pitcher [[Wei-Yin Chen]] from the Nippon Professional Baseball league, and [[Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez (pitcher)|Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez]] was signed as a minor league free agent.  [[Nate McLouth]] was signed to a minor league deal in June 2012 and made a significant impact down the stretch.  This year also marked the debut of the much-hyped prospect [[Manny Machado]].\n[[File:Adam Jones (34458825786).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adam Jones (baseball)|Adam Jones]] in 2017]]\nThe Orioles won 93 games in 2012 (after winning 69 in the previous year) thanks in large part to a 29\u20139 record in one-run games, and a 16\u20132 record in extra-inning games.  The difference between this Orioles bullpen and bullpens past was like night and day, led by [[Jim Johnson (baseball, born 1983)|Jim Johnson]] and his 51 saves.  He finished with a 2.49 ERA that season with [[Darren O'Day]], [[Luis Ayala (baseball)|Luis Ayala]], [[Pedro Strop]], and [[Troy Patton]] all finishing as well with ERAs under 3.00.  Experts{{Who|date=April 2015}} were amazed as the team continued to outperform expectations, but regression never came that year.  They battled with the New York Yankees for first place in the AL East up until September and would earn their first playoff berth in 15 years by winning the second wildcard spot in the American League.\n\nIn the 'sudden death' wildcard game against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Joe Saunders]] (acquired in August of that year in exchange for [[Matt Lindstrom]]) defeated [[Yu Darvish]] to help the Orioles advance to the divisional round, where they faced a familiar opponent, the Yankees. The Orioles forced the series to go five games (losing games 1 and 3 of the series, while winning 2 and 4), but [[CC Sabathia]] outpitched the Orioles [[Jason Hammel]] in Game 5 and the Orioles were eliminated from the playoffs.\n\nWhile the Orioles would ultimately miss the playoffs in 2013, they finished with a record of 85\u201377, tying the [[2013 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] for third place in the AL East. By posting winning records in 2012 and 2013, the Orioles achieved the feat of back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 1996 and 1997.\n\nOn September 16, 2014, the Orioles clinched the division for the first time since 1997 with a win against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] as well as making it back to the postseason for the second time in three years. The Orioles finished the 2014 season with a 96\u201366 record and went on to sweep the Detroit Tigers in the [[2014 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. The O's were then in turn swept by the [[Kansas City Royals]] in the [[2014 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].\n\nOut of an abundance of caution, the Baltimore Orioles announced the postponement of the April 27 and 28 games in 2015 against the [[Chicago White Sox]] following [[2015 Baltimore riots|violent riots]] in West Baltimore following the [[Killing of Freddie Gray|death of Freddie Gray]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ghiroli|first1=Brittany|title=Protests force postponement of O's-White Sox on Monday|url=http://m.orioles.mlb.com/news/article/120862472/protests-force-postponement-of-os-white-sox-on-monday|website=The Baltimore Orioles|publisher=MLB|access-date=April 28, 2015|date=April 27, 2015}}</ref> Following the announcement of the second postponement, the Orioles also announced that the third game in the series scheduled for Wednesday, April 29 was to be closed to the public and would be televised only,<ref>{{cite web|title=Orioles announcement regarding schedule changes|url=https://twitter.com/Orioles/status/593124360963031040|website=@Baltimore Orioles (twitter)|publisher=Baltimore Orioles|access-date=April 28, 2015}}</ref> apparently the first time in 145 years of Major League Baseball that a game had no spectators and breaking the previous 131-year-old record for lowest paid attendance to an official game (the previous record being 6.) <ref>{{cite news|title=Orioles, White Sox will play in empty Baltimore stadium Wednesday|url=http://www.news-record.com/sports/orioles-white-sox-will-play-in-empty-baltimore-stadium-wednesday/article_9fc6c0f8-ee15-11e4-aa49-8bb28fedf6c3.html|work=[[News & Record]]|agency=Associated Press|date=April 28, 2015|access-date=April 29, 2015}}</ref> The Orioles beat the White Sox, 8\u20132.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/boxscore/MLB_20150429_CHW@BAL|title=MLB Baseball Box Score \u2013 Chicago vs. Baltimore \u2013 Apr 29, 2015|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=June 19, 2015}}</ref> The Orioles said the make-up games would be played Thursday, May 28, as a double-header.

However, they would lose against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in the [[AL Wild Card]] game in Toronto. This was the last postseason appearance for Baltimore until 2023. In 2017, the Orioles started with a modest 22\u201310 record. Despite early season success, the Orioles suffered their first losing season since 2011. The Orioles would suffer one of Major League Baseball's worst seasons in 2018, en route to going 47\u2013115. 2018 proved to be general manager Duquette and Showalter's final season in Baltimore, as their contracts were not renewed after the season.\n\n==== More rebuilding years (2019\u20132021)====\nThe Orioles began their rebuild by trading away key players, most notably [[Manny Machado]], [[Zack Britton|Zach Britton]], [[Jonathan Schoop]], [[Brad Brach]], [[Kevin Gausman]], and [[Darren O'Day]] in July 2018. In 2019, the Orioles finished 54\u2013108, which was the second Orioles team to surpass the 1988 Orioles team's losses. In 2020, the Orioles experienced an upside in their rebuild, as they finished 25\u201335 in a season shortened by the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], their best finish since 2017. In 2021, the Orioles experienced two different losing streaks of at least 14, en route to a 52\u2013110 finish. 2021 was their third 110-loss season in team history. Their first was 1939 when they were known as the St. Louis Browns, the second was in 2018 as the Baltimore Orioles. \n\n==== Return to success and ownership changes (2022\u2013present) ====\n\nIn 2022, anticipated first-round pick catcher [[Adley Rutschman]] made his major-league debut in addition to rookie closer [[F\u00e9lix Bautista (baseball)|F\u00e9lix Bautista]].

Left to right: home, away, Saturday (away with gray pants), Friday (away with gray pants).]]\nThe Orioles' home uniform is white with the word \"Orioles\" written across the chest. The road uniform is gray with the word \"Baltimore\" written across the chest. This style, with noticeable changes in the script, striping and materials, has been worn for much of the team's history, but with a few exceptions:\n*In 1954, 1989\u201394 (road) and 1995\u20132003 (home), the scripted word \"Orioles\" and block letters are rendered in black with orange trim. The 1995\u20132003 style featured orange numbers in front but black letters in the back.\n*From 1963 to 1965, the home uniforms featured \"Orioles\" in block lettering instead of the more familiar cursive script style. It was also rendered in black with orange trim.\n*The underline below the word \"Orioles\" disappeared from 1966 to 1988.\n*Road uniforms bore the team name from 1954 to 1955 and from 1973 to 2008.\n*Extra white trim was added to the road and alternate uniforms from 1995 to 2000.\n*Sleeveless home alternate uniforms were used in the 1968 and 1969 seasons.\n*Player names were added to the uniforms in 1966, but the home uniforms originally featured black block letters. It would not match the road uniform lettering until 1971, which were orange with black trim.\n\nA long campaign of several decades was waged by numerous fans and sportswriters to return the name of the city to the \"away\" jerseys which was used since the 1950s and had been formerly dropped during the 1970s era of [[Edward Bennett Williams]] when the ownership was continuing to market the team also to fans in the nation's capital region after the moving of the former [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]] in 1971. After several decades, approximately 20% of the team's attendance came from the metro Washington area.\n[[File:Paul Blair 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Blair (baseball)|Paul Blair]] shown with the full-bodied bird logo between 1954 and 1965]]\n\nAn alternate uniform is black with the word \"Orioles\" written across the chest. They first wore black uniforms in the 1993 season and continue to do so since; the current style with the letters lacking additional trim was first used in 2000. The Orioles wear their black alternate jerseys for Friday night games with the alternate \"O's\" cap (first introduced in 2005), whether at home or on the road; the regular batting helmet is still used with this uniform. In 2017, the Orioles began to use their batting practice caps for select games with the black uniforms. The aforementioned caps resemble their regular road caps save for the black bill. Occasionally, the Orioles would also wear the black alternates on other days of the week, often pairing them with the home or road \"cartoon bird\" caps. After the \"City Connect\" uniforms became the team's Friday home uniform (see below), the black alternates were only used on Friday road games and on home games depending on the preference of the starting pitcher.\n\nThe Orioles also wore orange alternate uniforms at various points in their history. The orange alternates were first used in the 1971 season and were paired with orange pants, but these lasted only two seasons. The second orange uniform, which was a pullover style, was worn from 1975 to 1987, but were not worn at all in the 1983, 1985 and 1986 seasons. A third orange uniform was used from 1988 to 1992, returning to the button-down style. In 2012, the Orioles brought back the orange uniforms as a second alternate uniform; the team currently wears them on Saturdays at home or on the road, though they've also worn them on other days of the week either due to pitcher's preference or a previously postponed contest.\n\nThe Orioles' cap design have alternated between the team's iconic \"cartoon bird\" logo and the full-bodied bird logo. Initially, the caps had the full-bodied bird logo between 1954 and 1965, alternating between an all-black cap and an orange-brimmed black cap. They also wore a black cap with an orange block-letter \"B\" for part of the 1963 season. The \"cartoon bird\" was first used in 1966, and with minor tweaks, was prominently featured on the team's caps until 1988. Initially, the Orioles kept the orange-brimmed black cap with the \"cartoon bird\" but switched to a white-paneled black cap with orange brim in 1975. Also that same year, they wore orange-paneled black caps to pair with the orange alternates, but these lasted only two seasons.\n\nIn 1989, the full-bodied bird logo returned along with the all-black cap, with a few tweaks along the way. Initially the cap was used regardless of home or road games, but in 2002 the caps were worn only on the road until 2008. An orange-brimmed variety was also introduced in 1995. Initially exclusive to the team's black uniforms, this style became the home cap in 2002 and became the team's regular cap (home or away) from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn 2012, the Orioles brought back a modernized version of the \"cartoon bird\" along with the white-paneled and orange-brimmed black cap for home games and the orange-brimmed black cap for road games.\n\nIn 2013, ESPN ran a \"Battle of the Uniforms\" contest between all 30 Major League clubs. Despite using a ranking system that had the Orioles as a #13 seed, the Birds beat the #1 seed Cardinals in the championship round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9293168/orioles-win-title|title=Battle of the Uniforms: Orioles win title|work=ESPN.com|date=May 20, 2013|access-date=June 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2023, the Orioles introduced a [[City Connect]] uniform, inspired by the art and culture of Baltimore and its neighborhoods. The uniform is mostly black base from the jersey to pants. Across the chest, it features the city name \"BALTIMORE\" in white lettering, and on the collar and sleeves features a small batch of colors and shapes, representing the neighborhoods of Baltimore. The cap, which is also on a black base, features an italic white \"B\", which is similar to the team's away uniform.<ref>{{cite web |title=O's drop bold new City Connect jerseys \u2013 with a surprise inside |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/orioles-city-connect-uniforms-unveiled |website=MLB.com}}</ref>\n\n==Radio and television coverage==\n{{further|List of Baltimore Orioles broadcasters}}\n\n===Radio===\nIn Baltimore, Orioles radio broadcasts can be heard on [[WBAL (AM)|WBAL-AM]] and [[WIYY]], both owned by [[Hearst Television]]. [[Geoff Arnold (sportscaster)|Geoff Arnold]], [[Melanie Newman]], Brett Hollander, Scott Garceau and [[Kevin Brown (sportscaster)|Kevin Brown]] alternate as [[play-by-play]] announcers. WBAL feeds the games to a [[Baltimore Orioles Radio Network|network]] of 36 stations, covering Washington, D.C., and all or portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina.\n\nThis is WBAL's fourth stint as the Orioles flagship. WBAL has carried Orioles games for most of the team's time in Baltimore. Prior to WBAL and WIYY, Orioles games were broadcast locally on [[WJZ-FM]] from 2015 to 2021. WJZ had earlier carried broadcasts from 2007 to 2010.\n\nSix former Orioles franchise radio announcers have received the Hall of Fame's [[Ford C. Frick Award]] for excellence in broadcasting: [[Chuck Thompson]] (who was also the voice of the old NFL [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]]); [[Jon Miller]] (now with the [[San Francisco Giants]]); [[Ernie Harwell]], [[Herb Carneal]]; [[Bob Murphy (announcer)|Bob Murphy]] and [[Harry Caray]] (as a St. Louis Browns announcer in the 1940s<ref>''The Sporting News'', March 22, 1945, p. 16.</ref>).\n\nOther former Baltimore announcers include [[Josh Lewin]] (currently with [[New York Mets]]), [[Bill O'Donnell (sportscaster)|Bill O'Donnell]], [[Tom Marr]], Scott Garceau (returned in 2020 season), [[Mel Proctor]], [[Michael Reghi]], former major league catcher [[Buck Martinez]] (now [[Toronto Blue Jays]] play-by-play), and former Oriole players including Brooks Robinson, pitcher [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] and outfielder [[John Lowenstein]]. In 1991, the Orioles experimented with longtime TV writer/producer [[Ken Levine (TV personality)|Ken Levine]] as a play-by-play broadcaster. Levine was best noted for his work on TV shows such as ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', but lasted only one season in the Orioles broadcast booth.\n\n===Television===\n[[MASN]], co-owned by the Orioles and the Washington Nationals, is the team's exclusive television broadcaster. MASN airs almost the entire slate of regular season games. Some exceptions include [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Saturday games]] on either [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (via its Baltimore affiliate, [[WBFF]]) or [[Fox Sports 1]], or ''[[ESPN Major League Baseball|Sunday Night Baseball]]'' on [[ESPN]]. Many MASN telecasts in conflict with Nationals' game telecasts air on an alternate MASN2 feed.\n\nVeteran sportscaster [[Gary Thorne]] served as lead television announcer from 2007 to 2019, with [[Jim Hunter (sportscaster)|Jim Hunter]] as his backup along with Hall of Fame member and former Orioles pitcher [[Jim Palmer]] and former Oriole infielder [[Mike Bordick]] as color analysts, who almost always work separately. In 2020, Thorne and Palmer were removed from the television booth due to [[COVID-19]] concerns and replaced with Scott Garceau. In 2021, MASN let go Thorne, Hunter, analysts [[Mike Bordick]] and [[Rick Dempsey]], and studio host Tom Davis, and added [[Ben McDonald]] as a secondary analyst.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Trezza|first=Joe|title=O's, MASN announce '21 broadcast team|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/masn-makes-changes-to-orioles-broadcast-team|access-date=January 26, 2021|work=Major League Baseball}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Ruiz|first=Nathan|date=January 23, 2021|title='I'll treasure that forever': Gary Thorne not returning to Orioles broadcasts in 2021|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bs-sp-orioles-gary-thorne-masn-20210123-meeybwnl65h7rmymffpj37qmyy-story.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124020031/https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bs-sp-orioles-gary-thorne-masn-20210123-meeybwnl65h7rmymffpj37qmyy-story.html |archive-date=January 24, 2021 |access-date=February 14, 2021|website=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Meoli|first=Jon|title=Gary Thorne, Jim Palmer, others won't be at Camden Yards for broadcasts as Orioles limit in-person announce teams|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bs-sp-orioles-thorne-palmer-masn-broadcasts-20200718-u2qg7jpgafhrhkexp2w3njmqbm-story.html|access-date=April 25, 2021|website=baltimoresun.com|date=July 18, 2020 }}</ref> Starting in 2022, Kevin Brown became the primary TV play-by-play announcer, with Garceau, Arnold or Newman the backups.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lucia|first=Joe|title=Kevin Brown will be Orioles full-time TV broadcaster in 2022|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/mlb/kevin-brown-will-be-orioles-full-time-tv-broadcaster-in-2022.html|access-date=March 14, 2022|work=Awful Announcing|date=February 28, 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe Orioles severed their ties with Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic (now [[NBC Sports Washington]]) at the end of the 2006 season in favor of MASN, a joint venture with the [[Washington Nationals]]. It had been the Orioles' cable partner since 1984, when it was known as Home Team Sports. The Orioles and the Washington Nationals have been in a dispute since the early 2010s, MASN is owned by both teams with the Orioles holding an 80% stake. The dispute which is ongoing as of October 2020 contends that the Nationals deserves a greater fee from MASN due to the team's recent success and market growth. When fees paid to each team were first negotiated, both teams were paid the same fees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bs-sp-orioles-masn-appeal-20201022-jolni75h7fcijcayja6jgdykdy-story.html|work=The Baltimore Sun|title=Orioles lose appeal in $100 million MASN dispute with Nationals, will challenge in New York's highest court|date=October 22, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nWJZ-TV was the Orioles' broadcast TV home, completing its latest stint from 1994 through 2017.

Fans in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], chanted \"O!\" even before the [[Norfolk Tides|Tides]] became an Orioles affiliate. The practice caught some attention in the spring of 2005, when fans performed the \"O!\" cry at [[Washington Nationals]] games at [[RFK Stadium]]. The \"O!\" chant is also common at sporting events for the various [[Maryland Terrapins]] teams at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. At [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]'s induction into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]], the crowd, composed mostly of Orioles fans, carried out the \"O!\" tradition during [[Tony Gwynn]]'s daughter's rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Additionally, a faint but audible \"O!\" could be heard on the television broadcast of [[Barack Obama]]'s pre-inaugural visit to Baltimore as the national anthem played before his entrance. A resounding \"O!\" bellowed from the nearly 30,000 Ravens fans who attended the November 21, 2010, away game at the [[Carolina Panthers]]' [[Bank of America Stadium]] in Charlotte, North Carolina.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Edward|title='It was like a home game' vs. Panthers, said Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-11-22/sports/bs-sp-ravens-notebook-1122-20101121_1_ravens-quarterback-joe-flacco-ed-reed-panthers-fans|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=May 28, 2011}}</ref> A similar loud \"O!\" was heard from fans attending [[Super Bowl XLVII]] between the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ravens hold on to win Super Bowl, 34\u201331|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-02-04/news/bs-md-super-bowl-mainbar-20130203_1_john-harbaugh-jacoby-jones-ravens|access-date=April 13, 2016|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=February 4, 2013}}</ref> The \"O!\" chant was also heard during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], when Baltimore native [[Michael Phelps]] received his gold medal for the [[Swimming at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 200 metre freestyle relay|{{nowrap|4 \u00d7 200 m}} freestyle]] on August 9, 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Steinberg |first1=Dan |author-link1=Dan Steinberg |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2016/08/10/baltimores-national-anthem-oh-gives-michael-phelps-a-gold-medal-laugh/ |title=Baltimore's National Anthem 'Oh!' gives Michael Phelps a gold-medal laugh |newspaper=The Washington Post |department=D.C.

He also has an orange violin that spins for the fiddle solos. He went by the name Zillbilly and had done the skit from the 1999 season until shortly before he died in early 2013. Of course, that does nothing to explain why the Orioles' Audio staff began playing the song during every game's seventh inning stretch beginning in August 1975.\n\nIn reality, the song was tremendously successful nationwide, topping the Billboard Top 100 for one week in 1975, and was played in stadiums across the country. The Orioles were chasing the Red Sox for the American League East Division title and incorporated numerous \"good luck charms.\" After an inspiring comeback win, Oriole staff began playing this song at the seventh inning stretch of every home game as one of the good-luck charms, beginning in August.\n\nDuring a nationally televised game on September 20, 1997, Denver himself danced to the song atop the Orioles' dugout, one of his final public appearances before dying in a plane crash three weeks later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-10-14/features/1997287024_1_orioles-dugout-country-boy-fans |title=John Denver At Camden Yards &#124; 7th-inning stretch belonged to Denver Orioles: Time after time, 'Thank God I'm a Country Boy' got the stadium rocking.

The theme from ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' was played at the last game at Memorial Stadium in 1991, and the song \"Magic to Do\" from the stage musical ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'' was used that season to commemorate \"Orioles Magic\" on 33rd Street. During the Orioles' heyday in the 1970s, a club song, appropriately titled \"Orioles Magic (Feel It Happen)\", was composed by Walt Woodward,<ref name=BaltSun>{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/videogallery/81640911/Entertainment/Orioles-Magic-song-by-Walt-Woodward |title= Orioles Magic (Feel It Happen) |newspaper= The Baltimore Sun |author= Walt Woodward |date= 1970 |access-date= October 12, 2014}}</ref> and played when the team ran out until Opening Day of 2008. Since then, the song (a favorite among all fans, who appreciated its references to [[Wild Bill Hagy]] and [[Earl Weaver]]) is played (along with a video featuring several Orioles stars performing the song) only after wins. In the 2010s, \"[[Seven Nation Army]]\" was often played as a hype song while the fans chant the signature bass riff as a rally cry during key moments of a game or after a walk-off hit. In the 2023 season, closer Felix Bautista would come out of the bullpen to the ominous whistle of \"[[The Wire]]\" character [[Omar Little]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://ouresquina.com/2023/felix-bautista-brings-the-wire-whistle-to-orioles/ | title=Felix Bautista brings 'The Wire' whistle to Orioles | date=April 26, 2023 }}</ref>\n\n===The First Army Band===\n\nDuring the Orioles' final homestand of the season, it is a tradition to display a replica of the 15-star, 15-stripe [[American flag]] at Camden Yards. Prior to 1992, the 15-star, 15-stripe flag flew from Memorial Stadium's center-field flagpole in place of the 50-star, 13-stripe flag during the final homestand. Since the move to Camden Yards, the former flag has been displayed on the batters' eye. During the Orioles' final home game of the season, [[The United States Army Field Band]] from [[Fort Meade]] performs the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] prior to the start of the game. The Band has also played the National Anthem at the finales of three [[World Series]] in which the Orioles played: [[1970 World Series|1970]], [[1971 World Series|1971]] and [[1979 World Series|1979]]. They are introduced as the \"First Army Band\" during the pregame ceremonies.\n\n==PA announcer==\n\nFor 23 years, [[Rex Barney]] was the [[Public address|PA announcer]] for the Orioles. His voice became a fixture of both Memorial Stadium and Camden Yards, and his expression \"Give that fan a contract\", uttered whenever a fan caught a [[foul ball]], was one of his trademarks{{snd}}the other being his distinct \"Thank Yooooou{{nbsp}}...\" following every announcement. (He was also known on occasion to say \"Give that fan an error\" after a dropped foul ball.)
