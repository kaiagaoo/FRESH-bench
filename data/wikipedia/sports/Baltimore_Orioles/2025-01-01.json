The Orioles compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League East|East Division]]. As one of the American League's eight charter teams in 1901, the franchise spent its first year as a major league club in [[Milwaukee]] as the '''[[Milwaukee Brewers (1894\u20131901)|Milwaukee Brewers]]''' before moving to [[St. Louis]] to become the '''[[St. Louis Browns]]''' in 1902. After 52 years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests, led by attorney and civic activist [[Clarence Miles]] and Mayor [[Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.]] The team's current owner is [[David Rubenstein]]. The Orioles' home [[ballpark]] is [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], which opened in 1992 in [[downtown Baltimore]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/ct-camden-yards-wrigley-field-spt-0504-20170503-story.html |title=Camden Yards paved a retro revolution \u2014 and influenced Wrigley Field's renovations |first=Blair |last=Kamin |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date=April 15, 2019 |archive-date=April 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418010019/https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/ct-camden-yards-wrigley-field-spt-0504-20170503-story.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.citypaper.com/news/features/bcp-040517-feature-a-more-complex-legacy-oriole-park-25th-anniversary-html-htmlstory.html |title=A More Complex Legacy: Oriole Park is known as \"the ballpark that forever changed baseball\", and its impact may well extend to local governing |first=Brandon |last=Weigel |work=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |access-date=April 15, 2019 |archive-date=April 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418010010/https://www.citypaper.com/news/features/bcp-040517-feature-a-more-complex-legacy-oriole-park-25th-anniversary-html-htmlstory.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> \nThe oriole is the [[Baltimore oriole|official state bird of Maryland]]; the name has been used by several baseball clubs in the city, including [[Baltimore Orioles (1901\u20131902)|another AL charter member franchise]] which folded after the 1902 season and was replaced the next year by the New York Highlanders, later the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]. [[List of baseball nicknames|Nicknames]] for the team include the \"'''O's'''\" and the \"'''Birds'''\".\n\nThe franchise's first [[World Series]] appearance came in {{wsy|1944}} when the Browns lost to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. The Orioles went on to make six World Series appearances from 1966 to 1983, winning three in {{wsy|1966}}, {{wsy|1970}}, and {{wsy|1983}}. This era of the club featured several future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] who would later be inducted representing the Orioles, such as third baseman [[Brooks Robinson]], outfielder [[Frank Robinson]], starting pitcher [[Jim Palmer]], first baseman [[Eddie Murray]], shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr.]], and manager [[Earl Weaver]]. The Orioles have won a total of ten division championships (1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1979, 1983, 1997, 2014, 2023), seven [[American League Championship Series|pennants]] (1944 while in St. Louis, 1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979, 1983), and four [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] berths (1996, 2012, 2016, 2024). The franchise was the last charter member of the American League to win a pennant, and the last charter member to win a World Series.\n\nAfter 14 consecutive losing seasons between 1998 and 2011, the team qualified for the postseason three times under manager [[Buck Showalter]] and general manager [[Dan Duquette]], including a division title and advancement to the [[American League Championship Series]] for the first time in 17 years in [[2014 Baltimore Orioles season|2014]].

The Brewers were still league members when the WL renamed itself the [[American League]] (AL) in 1900. At the end of the 1900 season, the AL removed itself from baseball's National Agreement, the formal understanding between the [[National League (baseball)|National League]] (NL) and the minor leagues, and declared itself a competing major league. During 1901, the first season the AL operated as a major league, the Brewers finished last among the league's eight teams.\n\nIn 1902, the team moved to [[St. Louis]] and became the \"Browns\", named after the original name of the 1880s club now known as the [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]]. Although they usually fielded mediocre teams, they were very popular at the gate. In 1916, after years of prosperity at the gate, [[Robert Hedges (baseball)|Robert Hedges]] sold the team to [[Phil Ball (baseball)|Phil Ball]], who made a considerable effort to make the Browns competitive. However, Ball's tenure was marked by errors, including the firing of [[Branch Rickey]], which eventually benefited the Cardinals, who shared [[Sportsman's Park]] with the Browns.\n\nThe [[1944 St. Louis Browns season|1944 season]] saw the Browns winning their only St. Louis-based American League pennant, becoming the last of the 16 teams that made up the major leagues from 1901 to 1960, to play in a [[World Series]]. In 1951, [[Bill Veeck]] purchased the Browns and introduced a series of promotions and wild antics. Veeck's efforts to drive the Cardinals out of St. Louis failed when [[Anheuser-Busch]] purchased the Cardinals. Veeck attempted to move the Browns to [[Milwaukee]] and then [[Baltimore]], but both moves were initially blocked by other American League owners. Eventually, Veeck sold his stake to a group of Baltimore investors, and the team moved to Baltimore for the [[1954 Baltimore Orioles season|1954 season]], renaming themselves the Baltimore Orioles. The name has a rich history in Baltimore, having been used by Baltimore baseball teams since the late 19th century. The Orioles' early years in Baltimore were marked by a gradual climb to respectability, leading to their first [[1966 World Series|World Series title in 1966]]. The Orioles enjoyed a period of sustained success from 1966 to 1983, winning three World Series titles and six [[American League pennant]]s.\n\nAfter the 1983 World Series win, the Orioles experienced a decline, culminating in the 1988 season where they lost the first 21 games. In 1989, the Orioles showed improvement with the \"Why Not?\" Orioles finishing second in the AL East. The opening of [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] in 1992 marked a new era, and the team returned to the playoffs in 1996 and 1997. However, the late 1990s and 2000s were characterized by losing seasons and rebuilding efforts. The Orioles saw a resurgence in the 2010s, making the playoffs in 2012, 2014, and 2016, with [[Buck Showalter]] as manager. The team struggled again towards the end of the decade, leading to a major rebuild. The 2020s have been marked by rebuilding efforts and developing young talent, aiming for future competitiveness.\n\n=== Return to success and ownership changes (2022\u2013present) ===\nIn 2022, anticipated first-round pick catcher [[Adley Rutschman]] made his major-league debut in addition to rookie closer [[F\u00e9lix Bautista (baseball)|F\u00e9lix Bautista]]. The Orioles finished the 2022 season with a 83\u201379 record, becoming the second team in MLB history to have a winning season only one year after losing 110 or more games.\n\nOn June 9, 2022, Louis Angelos sued his brother, Orioles chairman and CEO John P.

The suit claims Angelos unilaterally fired long-time employees loyal to his father, including former center fielder [[Brady Anderson]], the longtime special assistant to the executive vice president for baseball operations.

Left to right: home, away, Saturday (away with gray pants), Friday (away with gray pants).]]\nThe Orioles' home uniform is white with the word \"Orioles\" written across the chest. The road uniform is gray with the word \"Baltimore\" written across the chest. This style, with noticeable changes in the script, striping and materials, has been worn for much of the team's history, but with a few exceptions:\n*In 1954, 1989\u201394 (road) and 1995\u20132003 (home), the scripted word \"Orioles\" and block letters are rendered in black with orange trim. The 1995\u20132003 style featured orange numbers in front but black letters in the back.\n*From 1963 to 1965, the home uniforms featured \"Orioles\" in block lettering instead of the more familiar cursive script style. It was also rendered in black with orange trim.\n*The underline below the word \"Orioles\" disappeared from 1966 to 1988.\n*Road uniforms bore the team name from 1954 to 1955 and from 1973 to 2008.\n*Extra white trim was added to the road and alternate uniforms from 1995 to 2000.\n*Sleeveless home alternate uniforms were used in the 1968 and 1969 seasons.\n*Player names were added to the uniforms in 1966, but the home uniforms originally featured black block letters. It would not match the road uniform lettering until 1971, which were orange with black trim.\n\nA long campaign of several decades was waged by numerous fans and sportswriters to return the name of the city to the \"away\" jerseys which was used since the 1950s and had been formerly dropped during the 1970s era of [[Edward Bennett Williams]] when the ownership was continuing to market the team also to fans in the nation's capital region after the moving of the former [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]] in 1971. After several decades, approximately 20% of the team's attendance came from the metro Washington area.{{Source?|date=October 2024}}\n\nIn 2013, [[ESPN]] ran a \"Battle of the Uniforms\" contest between all 30 Major League clubs. Despite using a ranking system that had the Orioles as a #13 seed, the Birds beat the #1 seed [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] in the championship round.<ref>{{cite web |date=May 20, 2013 |title=Battle of the Uniforms: Orioles win title |url=https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/9293168/orioles-win-title |access-date=June 19, 2015 |work=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Caps ===\nThe Orioles' cap design have alternated between the team's iconic \"cartoon bird\" logo and the full-bodied bird logo. Initially, the caps had the full-bodied bird logo between 1954 and 1965, alternating between an all-black cap and an orange-brimmed black cap. They also wore a black cap with an orange block-letter \"B\" for part of the 1963 season. The \"cartoon bird\" was first used in 1966, and with minor tweaks, was prominently featured on the team's caps until 1988. Initially, the Orioles kept the orange-brimmed black cap with the \"cartoon bird\" but switched to a white-paneled black cap with orange brim in 1975. Also that same year, they wore orange-paneled black caps to pair with the orange alternates, but these lasted only two seasons.\n\nIn 1989, the full-bodied bird logo returned along with the all-black cap, with a few tweaks along the way. Initially the cap was used regardless of home or road games, but in 2002 the caps were worn only on the road until 2008. An orange-brimmed variety was also introduced in 1995. Initially exclusive to the team's black uniforms, this style became the home cap in 2002 and became the team's regular cap (home or away) from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn 2012, the Orioles brought back a modernized version of the \"cartoon bird\" along with the white-paneled and orange-brimmed black cap for home games and the orange-brimmed black cap for road games.[[File:Paul Blair 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Blair (baseball)|Paul Blair]] shown with the full-bodied bird logo between 1954 and 1965]]\n\n=== Alternate Uniforms ===\nAn [[Third jersey|alternate uniform]] is black with the word \"Orioles\" written across the chest. They first wore black uniforms in the 1993 season and continue to do so since; the current style with the letters lacking additional trim was first used in 2000. The Orioles wear their black alternate jerseys for Friday night games with the alternate \"O's\" cap (first introduced in 2005), whether at home or on the road; the regular batting helmet is still used with this uniform. In 2017, the Orioles began to use their batting practice caps for select games with the black uniforms. The aforementioned caps resemble their regular road caps save for the black bill. Occasionally, the Orioles would also wear the black alternates on other days of the week, often pairing them with the home or road \"cartoon bird\" caps. After the \"City Connect\" uniforms became the team's Friday home uniform (see below), the black alternates were only used on Friday road games and on home games depending on the preference of the starting pitcher.\n\nThe Orioles also wore orange alternate uniforms at various points in their history. The orange alternates were first used in the 1971 season and were paired with orange pants, but these lasted only two seasons. The second orange uniform, which was a pullover style, was worn from 1975 to 1987, but were not worn at all in the 1983, 1985 and 1986 seasons. A third orange uniform was used from 1988 to 1992, returning to the button-down style. In 2012, the Orioles brought back the orange uniforms as a second alternate uniform; the team currently wears them on Saturdays at home or on the road, though they've also worn them on other days of the week either due to pitcher's preference or a previously postponed contest.\n\nIn 2023, the Orioles introduced a [[City Connect]] uniform, inspired by the art and culture of Baltimore and its neighborhoods. The uniform is mostly black base from the jersey to pants. Across the chest, it features the city name \"BALTIMORE\" in white lettering, and on the collar and sleeves features a small batch of colors and shapes, representing the [[List of Baltimore neighborhoods|neighborhoods of Baltimore]]. The cap, which is also on a black base, features an italic white \"B\". In 2024, the City Connect uniform was worn with the home white pants for select games.<ref>{{cite web |title=O's drop bold new City Connect jerseys \u2013 with a surprise inside |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/orioles-city-connect-uniforms-unveiled |website=MLB.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Uniform Advertisements ===\nThe [[2024 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] announced its first-ever jersey sponsorship deal with [[T.

[[Geoff Arnold (sportscaster)|Geoff Arnold]], [[Melanie Newman]], Brett Hollander, Scott Garceau and [[Kevin Brown (sportscaster)|Kevin Brown]] alternate as [[play-by-play]] announcers. WBAL feeds the games to a [[Baltimore Orioles Radio Network|network]] of 36 stations, covering Washington, D.C., and all or portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina.\n\nThis is WBAL's fourth stint as the Orioles flagship. WBAL has carried Orioles games for most of the team's time in Baltimore. Prior to WBAL and WIYY, Orioles games were broadcast locally on [[WJZ-FM]] from 2015 to 2021. WJZ had earlier carried broadcasts from 2007 to 2010.\n\nSix former Orioles franchise radio announcers have received the Hall of Fame's [[Ford C. Frick Award]] for excellence in broadcasting: [[Chuck Thompson]] (who was also the voice of the old NFL [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]]); [[Jon Miller]] (now with the [[San Francisco Giants]]); [[Ernie Harwell]], [[Herb Carneal]]; [[Bob Murphy (announcer)|Bob Murphy]] and [[Harry Caray]] (as a St. Louis Browns announcer in the 1940s<ref>''The Sporting News'', March 22, 1945, p. 16.</ref>).\n\nOther former Baltimore announcers include [[Josh Lewin]] (currently with [[New York Mets]]), [[Bill O'Donnell (sportscaster)|Bill O'Donnell]], [[Tom Marr]], Scott Garceau (returned in 2020 season), [[Mel Proctor]], [[Michael Reghi]], former major league catcher [[Buck Martinez]] (now [[Toronto Blue Jays]] play-by-play), Joe Angel and former Oriole players including Brooks Robinson, pitcher [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] and outfielder [[John Lowenstein]]. In 1991, the Orioles experimented with longtime TV writer/producer [[Ken Levine (TV personality)|Ken Levine]] as a play-by-play broadcaster. Levine was best noted for his work on TV shows such as ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', but lasted only one season in the Orioles broadcast booth.\n\n===Television===\n[[MASN]], co-owned by the Orioles and the Washington Nationals, is the team's exclusive television broadcaster. MASN airs almost the entire slate of regular season games. Some exceptions include [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Saturday games]] on either [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (via its Baltimore affiliate, [[WBFF]]) or [[Fox Sports 1]], or ''[[ESPN Major League Baseball|Sunday Night Baseball]]'' on [[ESPN]].

Fans in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], chanted \"O!\" even before the [[Norfolk Tides|Tides]] became an Orioles affiliate. The practice caught some attention in the spring of 2005, when fans performed the \"O!\" cry at [[Washington Nationals]] games at [[RFK Stadium]]. The \"O!\" chant is also common at sporting events for the various [[Maryland Terrapins]] teams at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. At [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]'s induction into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]], the crowd, composed mostly of Orioles fans, carried out the \"O!\" tradition during [[Tony Gwynn]]'s daughter's rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Additionally, a faint but audible \"O!\" could be heard on the television broadcast of [[Barack Obama]]'s pre-inaugural visit to Baltimore as the national anthem played before his entrance. A resounding \"O!\" bellowed from the nearly 30,000 Ravens fans who attended the November 21, 2010, away game at the [[Carolina Panthers]]' [[Bank of America Stadium]] in Charlotte, North Carolina.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Edward|title='It was like a home game' vs. Panthers, said Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/2010/11/22/it-was-like-a-home-game-vs-panthers-said-ravens-quarterback-joe-flacco/|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=November 22, 2010 |access-date=May 28, 2011}}</ref> A similar loud \"O!\" was heard from fans attending [[Super Bowl XLVII]] between the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ravens hold on to win Super Bowl, 34\u201331|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/2013/02/04/ravens-hold-on-to-win-super-bowl-34-31/|access-date=April 13, 2016|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=February 4, 2013}}</ref> The \"O!\" chant was also heard during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], when Baltimore native [[Michael Phelps]] received his gold medal for the [[Swimming at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 200 metre freestyle relay|{{nowrap|4 \u00d7 200 m}} freestyle]] on August 9, 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Steinberg |first1=Dan |author-link1=Dan Steinberg |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2016/08/10/baltimores-national-anthem-oh-gives-michael-phelps-a-gold-medal-laugh/ |title=Baltimore's National Anthem 'Oh!' gives Michael Phelps a gold-medal laugh |newspaper=The Washington Post |department=D.C.

Of course, that does nothing to explain why the Orioles' Audio staff began playing the song during every game's seventh inning stretch beginning in August 1975.\n\nIn reality, the song was tremendously successful nationwide, topping the Billboard Top 100 for one week in 1975, and was played in stadiums across the country. The Orioles were chasing the Red Sox for the American League East Division title and incorporated numerous \"good luck charms.\" After an inspiring comeback win, Oriole staff began playing this song at the seventh inning stretch of every home game as one of the good-luck charms, beginning in August.\n\nDuring a nationally televised game on September 20, 1997, Denver himself danced to the song atop the Orioles' dugout, one of his final public appearances before dying in a plane crash three weeks later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1997-10-14-1997287024-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225134818/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-10-14/features/1997287024_1_orioles-dugout-country-boy-fans |url-status=live |archive-date=February 25, 2013 |title=John Denver At Camden Yards &#124; 7th-inning stretch belonged to Denver Orioles: Time after time, 'Thank God I'm a Country Boy' got the stadium rocking.

The theme from ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' was played at the last game at Memorial Stadium in 1991, and the song \"Magic to Do\" from the stage musical ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'' was used that season to commemorate \"Orioles Magic\" on 33rd Street.

Since then, the song (a favorite among all fans, who appreciated its references to [[Wild Bill Hagy]] and [[Earl Weaver]]) is played (along with a video featuring several Orioles stars performing the song) only after wins. In the 2010s, \"[[Seven Nation Army]]\" was often played as a hype song while the fans chant the signature bass riff as a rally cry during key moments of a game or after a walk-off hit. In the 2023 season, closer Felix Bautista would come out of the bullpen to the ominous whistle of ''[[The Wire]]'' character [[Omar Little]].<ref name=\"t844\">{{cite web | last=G\u00f3mez | first=Manuel | title=Felix Bautista brings 'The Wire' whistle to Orioles | website=Our Esquina | date=2023-04-26 | url=https://ouresquina.com/2023/felix-bautista-brings-the-wire-whistle-to-orioles/ | access-date=2024-09-16}}</ref>\n\n===The First Army Band===\n\nDuring the Orioles' final homestand of the season, it is a tradition to display a replica of the 15-star, 15-stripe [[American flag]] at Camden Yards. Prior to 1992, the 15-star, 15-stripe flag flew from Memorial Stadium's center-field flagpole in place of the 50-star, 13-stripe flag during the final homestand. Since the move to Camden Yards, the former flag has been displayed on the batters' eye. During the Orioles' final home game of the season, [[The United States Army Field Band]] from [[Fort Meade]] performs the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] prior to the start of the game. The Band has also played the National Anthem at the finales of three [[World Series]] in which the Orioles played: [[1970 World Series|1970]], [[1971 World Series|1971]] and [[1979 World Series|1979]]. They are introduced as the \"First Army Band\" during the pregame ceremonies.\n\n==PA announcer==\n\nFor 23 years, [[Rex Barney]] was the [[Public address|PA announcer]] for the Orioles. His voice became a fixture of both Memorial Stadium and Camden Yards, and his expression \"Give that fan a contract\", uttered whenever a fan caught a [[foul ball]], was one of his trademarks{{snd}}the other being his distinct \"Thank Yooooou{{nbsp}}...\" following every announcement. (He was also known on occasion to say \"Give that fan an error\" after a dropped foul ball.)
