The modern badge used today represents the club colours and the flag of the ''[[Comune]] di [[Milan]]o'', with the acronym ''ACM'' at the top and the foundation year (1899) at the bottom.<ref name=\"weltfussball\"/> For what concerns the badge worn on match kits, from the origins to the mid-1940s it was simply the flag of Milan. For many decades no club logo was displayed, with the exception of the devil's logo in the early 1980s. The club badge made its definitive appearance on the match strips in the 1995\u201396, in a form that remained basically unchanged until present days.\n\nSince its foundation, the AC Milan home kit consisted of a red and black striped shirt, combined with white shorts and black socks; over the course of the decades, only cyclical changes dictated by the fashions of the time affected this pattern, which remained almost unchanged up to present days. In the first decade of the 20th century, the Rossoneri's first kit was a simple silk shirt characterized by thin stripes, with the badge of the city of Milan sewn at heart level. From the 1910s, the stripes were enlarged following a pattern that would remain unchanged until the late 1950s. The 1960s marked a return to the origins, with the use of thin stripes. This style would last until the 1985\u201386 season, with a small intermezzo from 1980 to 1982, when the stripes changed to a middle size again. A notable innovation occurred in this period. Between the 1979\u201380 and 1980\u201381 seasons, the AC Milan shirt achieved an important record by adding the surnames of the players above the number for the first time in Italian football.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.glieroidelcalcio.com/2020/06/11/nomi-sulle-maglie/|title=Sono passati 40 anni dalla prima volta dei nomi sulle maglie|date=11 June 2020 |access-date=9 March 2023|archive-date=9 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230309203229/https://www.glieroidelcalcio.com/2020/06/11/nomi-sulle-maglie/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the 1986\u201387 season, under the impulse of the new club owner [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the stripes were brought back to a middle size, and the colour of the socks was changed to white, taking the same colour of the shorts. In such a way, Berlusconi aimed at giving the players a more elegant look, as well as making the kit more distinguishably ''red and black'' when watched on the television compared to the thin striped kit, which, at a distance and on the television, could mistaken for a full red or brown shirt.<ref>{{cite news|title=La maglia pi\u00f9 bella|publisher=Guerin Sportivo|author=Nicola Calzaretta|date=August 2012|pages=99\u2013112}}</ref> This style continued until 1998.

It could not be defined as a stadium, as there were no dressing rooms, no stands and no other facilities. In 1903, Milan moved to the ''Acquabella'' pitch, where the stands consisted of a section of ground raised for the purpose. Milan played there until 1905. The following year the club moved to the ''Porta Monforte'' pitch, where they played until 1914. The stadium was furnished with a ticket office and wooden stands. In the following years Milan played at the ''[[Velodromo Sempione]]'' from 1914 to 1920, and at the ''Viale Lombardia'' stadium from 1920 to 1926. The latter was a modern structure, with a big main stand and which hosted several games of the [[Italy national football team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/Storia-Campi.html|title=AC Milan stadiums|access-date=15 March 2023|archive-date=29 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729141701/http://www.magliarossonera.it/Storia-Campi.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1926 Milan moved to the stadium where they still play nowadays: The [[San Siro]].\nThe stadium,<ref name=\"sansirosize\"/> officially known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza after the [[Giuseppe Meazza|former player]] who represented both Milan and [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]], has 75,923 seats. The more commonly used name, \"San Siro\", is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro was privately built by funding from Milan's president at the time, [[Piero Pirelli]]. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took {{frac|13|1|2}} months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Internazionale when the other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant.\n\nThe first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6\u20133 in a friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1\u20132 to [[Sampierdarenese]]. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008 its capacity was reduced to 80,018, to meet the new standards set by [[UEFA]].\n\nBased on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, largely thanks to the closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of [[flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] by supporters contributes to the atmosphere but the practice has occasionally caused problems.\n\nOn 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director [[Adriano Galliani]] announced that the club was seriously working towards a relocation. He stated Milan's new stadium will be largely based on the [[Veltins-Arena]]&nbsp;\u2013 the home of [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in [[Gelsenkirchen]]&nbsp;\u2013 and will follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium would likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. On 11 December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property stadium of 42,000 seats in [[Portello (district of Milan)|Portello]], behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri, and the large square \"Piazza Gino Valle\". The new village with shopping malls and hotel is located near [[CityLife (Milan)|CityLife]] district and is served by the [[Milan Metro|metro]].<ref name=rep3sep>{{cite news

In Italy they cumulatively won five Serie A titles, while internationally they collected four European cups. On the bench it showcased the clash of two different approaches to [[Catenaccio]] by the two managers: [[Nereo Rocco]] for Milan and [[Helenio Herrera]] for Inter. On the pitch the stage was taken by some of the biggest stars the Italian Serie A could offer: players such as [[Gianni Rivera]], [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Altafini]] for Milan and [[Sandro Mazzola]], [[Giacinto Facchetti]] and [[Luis Su\u00e1rez (footballer, born 1935)|Luis Su\u00e1rez]] for Inter. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the start of the game.

In the film appear, in addition to the coach [[Lajos Czeizler]], many of the Milan players of the time, including [[Lorenzo Buffon]], [[Carlo Annovazzi]] and the entire [[Gre-No-Li]] trio.{{citation needed|date=October 2023}}\n\nMilan as a fan base and some of their most popular players appeared in several Italian comedy movies. Among them the following are worth mentioning: [[Eccezzziunale... veramente]], [[Really SSSupercool: Chapter Two]] (whose cast includes [[Paolo Maldini]], [[Gennaro Gattuso]], [[Massimo Ambrosini]], [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]], [[Andriy Shevchenko]] and [[Alessandro Costacurta]]) and [[Tifosi (film)|Tifosi]] (whose cast includes [[Franco Baresi]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2023}}\n\n===Milan TV===\nOn 16 December 1999, on the day of the centenary of the club's foundation, [[Milan TV|Milan Channel]] was launched.

It was founded in 1963 by journalist Gino Sansoni and published by [[Panini Group|Panini]]. Issued with a monthly cadence, it covered all events surrounding Milan, with interviews to its protagonists, special posters, reports of official and friendly matches. Under the direction of Gigi Vesigna it reached a monthly circulation of 130,000 copies.
