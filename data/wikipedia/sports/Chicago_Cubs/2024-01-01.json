In the runup to their NL debut, owner [[William Hulbert]] signed various star players, such as pitcher [[Albert Spalding]] and infielders [[Ross Barnes]], [[Deacon White]], and [[Cap Anson|Adrian \"Cap\" Anson]]. The White Stockings quickly established themselves as one of the new league's top teams. Spalding won forty-seven games and Barnes led the league in hitting at .429 as Chicago won the first National League [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]], which at the time was the game's top prize.\n\nAfter back-to-back pennants in 1880 and 1881, Hulbert died, and Spalding, who had retired from playing to start [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] sporting goods, assumed ownership of the club. The White Stockings, with Anson acting as player-manager, captured their third consecutive pennant in 1882, and Anson established himself as the game's first true superstar. In 1885 and 1886, after winning NL pennants, the White Stockings met the champions of the short-lived [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in that era's version of a World Series. Both seasons resulted in matchups with the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Brown Stockings]]; the clubs tied in 1885 and St. Louis won in 1886. This was the genesis of what would eventually become one of the greatest [[Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry|rivalries]] in sports. In all, the Anson-led Chicago Base Ball Club won six National League pennants between 1876 and 1886. By [[1890 in baseball|1890]], the team had become known the '''Chicago Colts''',<ref name=\"1890colts\">{{cite web |url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1890.shtml |title = 1890 Chicago Colts |publisher = baseball-reference.com |access-date = August 16, 2008 }}</ref> or sometimes \"Anson's Colts\", referring to Cap's influence within the club. Anson was the first player in history credited with [[3,000 hit club|3,000 career hits]].

Adams]]' poem \"[[Baseball's Sad Lexicon]]\". The poem first appeared in the July 18, 1910 edition of the ''[[New York Evening Mail]]''. [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai \"Three-Finger\" Brown]], [[Jack Taylor (20th-century baseball player)|Jack Taylor]], [[Ed Reulbach]], [[Jack Pfiester]], and [[Orval Overall]] were several key pitchers for the Cubs during this time period. With Chance acting as player-manager from 1905 to 1912, the Cubs won four pennants and two World Series titles over a five-year span. Although they fell to the \"Hitless Wonders\" White Sox in the [[1906 World Series]], the Cubs recorded a record 116 victories and the [[List of best MLB season records|best winning percentage]] (.763) in Major League history. With mostly the same roster, Chicago won back-to-back World Series championships in [[1907 World Series|1907]] and [[1908 World Series|1908]], becoming the first Major League club to play three times in the Fall Classic and the first to win it twice. However, the Cubs would not win another World Series until [[2016 World Series|2016]]; this remains the longest championship drought in North American professional sports.\n\n[[File:1913 Chicago Cubs.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|1913 Chicago Cubs}}]]\nThe next season, veteran catcher [[Johnny Kling]] left the team to become a professional [[pocket billiards]] player. Some historians think Kling's absence was significant enough to prevent the Cubs from also winning a third straight title in 1909, as they finished 6 games out of first place.<ref>{{cite book |title = Three Finger |first1 = Cindy |last1 = Thomson |first2 = Scott |last2 = Brown |date = January 2006 |publisher = University of Nebraska Press |isbn = 0-8032-4448-7 |pages = 88\u201389 }}</ref> When Kling returned the next year, the Cubs won the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] again, but lost to the Philadelphia Athletics in the [[1910 World Series]].\n\nIn 1914, advertising executive [[Albert Lasker]] obtained a large block of the club's shares and before the 1916 season assumed majority ownership of the franchise. Lasker brought in a wealthy partner, [[Charles Weeghman]], the proprietor of a popular chain of lunch counters who had previously owned the [[Chicago Whales]] of the short-lived [[Federal League]]. As principal owners, the pair moved the club from the West Side Grounds to the much newer [[Weeghman Park]], which had been constructed for the Whales only two years earlier, where they remain to this day. The Cubs responded by winning a pennant in the war-shortened season of 1918, where they played a part in [[Curse of the Bambino|another team's curse]]: the [[Boston Red Sox]] defeated [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]'s Cubs four games to two in the [[1918 World Series]], Boston's last Series championship until 2004.\n\nBeginning in 1916, [[William Wrigley, Jr.|Bill Wrigley]] of chewing-gum fame acquired an increasing quantity of stock in the Cubs. By 1921 he was the majority owner, maintaining that status into the 1930s.\n\nMeanwhile, the year 1919 saw the start of the tenure of [[William Veeck, Sr.|Bill Veeck, Sr.]] as team president. Veeck would hold that post throughout the 1920s and into the 30s. The management team of Wrigley and Veeck came to be known as the \"double-Bills\".\n\n===The Wrigley years (1921\u20131945)===\n\n====1929\u20131938: Every three years====\n[[File:Hack Wilson BBHOF (cropped).png|thumb|upright|Hall of Famer [[Hack Wilson]]]]\n[[File:1920 cub logo.svg|thumb|left|120px|Club logo (1927\u20131936)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/54 |title = Chicago Cubs Logos }}</ref>]]Near the end of the first decade of the double-Bills' guidance, the Cubs won the NL Pennant in 1929 and then achieved the unusual feat of winning a pennant every three years, following up the 1929 flag with league titles in 1932, 1935, and 1938. Unfortunately, their success did not extend to the [[List of baseball jargon (F)|Fall Classic]], as they fell to their [[American League|AL]] rivals each time. The [[1932 World Series|'32 series]] against the [[1932 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] featured Babe Ruth's \"[[Babe Ruth's called shot|called shot]]\" at Wrigley Field in game three. There were some historic moments for the Cubs as well; In 1930, [[Hack Wilson]], one of the top home run hitters in the game, had one of the most impressive seasons in MLB history, hitting 56 home runs and establishing the current runs-batted-in record of 191. That 1930 club, which boasted six eventual hall of fame members (Wilson, [[Gabby Hartnett]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], [[George Kelly (baseball)|George \"High Pockets\" Kelly]], [[Kiki Cuyler]] and manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]]) established the current team batting average record of .309. In 1935 the Cubs claimed the pennant in thrilling fashion, winning a record 21 games in a row in September. The [[1938 Chicago Cubs season|'38 club]] saw [[Dizzy Dean]] lead the team's pitching staff and provided a historic moment when they won a crucial late-season game at Wrigley Field over the [[1938 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] with a [[walk-off home run]] by Gabby Hartnett, which became known in baseball [[folklore|lore]] as \"[[The Homer in the Gloamin']]\".<ref>{{cite news |first = Marc |last = Zarefsky |title = 'Homer in the Gloamin' most memorable |date = August 8, 2007 |work = MLB.com |url = http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/chc/y2007/m07/d20/c2099223.jsp |access-date = June 11, 2008 |archive-date = July 14, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110714103408/http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/chc/y2007/m07/d20/c2099223.jsp |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter the \"Double-Bills\" (Wrigley and Veeck) died in 1932 and 1933 respectively, [[P.K.

Due to the wartime travel restrictions, the first three games of the [[1945 World Series]] were played in [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Detroit]], where the Cubs won two games, including a one-hitter by [[Claude Passeau]], and the final four were played at Wrigley. The Cubs lost the series, and did not return until the [[2016 World Series]]. After losing the 1945 World Series to the [[Detroit Tigers]], the Cubs finished with a respectable 82\u201371 record in the following year, but this was only good enough for third place.\n\nIn the following two decades, the Cubs played mostly forgettable baseball, finishing among the worst teams in the National League on an almost annual basis. From 1947 to 1966, they only notched one winning season. Longtime infielder-manager [[Phil Cavarretta]], who had been a key player during the 1945 season, was fired during spring training in 1954 after admitting the team was unlikely to finish above fifth place. Although shortstop [[Ernie Banks]] would become one of the star players in the league during the next decade, finding help for him proved a difficult task, as quality players such as [[Hank Sauer]] were few and far between. This, combined with poor ownership decisions such as the [[College of Coaches]], and the ill-fated trade of future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] member [[Lou Brock]] to the Cardinals for pitcher [[Ernie Broglio]] (who won only seven games over the next three seasons), hampered on-field performance.\n\n====1969: Fall of '69====\n{{Main|1969 Chicago Cubs season}}\n[[File:Ernie Banks 1969.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ernie Banks]] (\"Mr. Cub\")]]\nThe late-1960s brought hope of a renaissance, with third baseman [[Ron Santo]], pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins]], and outfielder [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]] joining Banks. After losing a dismal 103 games in 1966, the Cubs brought home consecutive winning records in [[1967 Major League Baseball season|'67]] and [[1968 Major League Baseball season|'68]], marking the first time a Cub team had accomplished that feat in over two decades.\n\nIn {{mlby|1969}} the Cubs, managed by [[Leo Durocher]], built a substantial lead in the newly created [[National League East]]ern Division by mid-August. [[Ken Holtzman]] pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 {{frac|1|2}} games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 {{frac|1|2}} games over the [[1969 New York Mets season|New York Mets]]. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84\u201352 with the Mets in second place at 77\u201355. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9\u20132 and 13\u20134, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a two-out, two-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7\u20135 in extra innings.[6]\nBurdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84\u201358 just 1\u20442 game in front. More of the same followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84\u201360 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85\u201357. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.[1] The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92\u201370 record, would be remembered for having lost a remarkable 17\u00bd games in the standings to the Mets in the last quarter of the season.\n\n====1977\u20131979: June Swoon====\n{{Main|1977 Chicago Cubs season}}\nFollowing the 1969 season, the club posted winning records for the next few seasons, but no playoff action. After the core players of those teams started to move on, the 70s got worse for the team, and they became known as \"the Loveable Losers\". In {{mlby|1977}}, the team found some life, but ultimately experienced one of its [https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1977.shtml biggest collapses.] The Cubs hit a high-water mark on June 28 at 47\u201322, boasting an {{frac|8|1|2}} game NL East lead, as they were led by [[Bobby Murcer]] (27 HR/89 RBI), and [[Rick Reuschel]] (20\u201310). However, the [[1977 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] cut the lead to two by the All-star break, as the Cubs sat 19 games over .500, but they swooned late in the season, going 20\u201340 after July 31. The Cubs finished in fourth place at 81\u201381, while Philadelphia surged, finishing with 101 wins. The following two seasons also saw the Cubs get off to a fast start, as the team rallied to over 10 games above .500 well into both seasons, only to again wear down and play poorly later on, and ultimately settling back to mediocrity. This trait became known as the \"June Swoon\". Again, the Cubs' unusually high number of day games is often pointed to as one reason for the team's inconsistent late-season play.\n\nWrigley died in 1977. The Wrigley family sold the team to the [[Chicago Tribune]] in 1981, ending a 65-year family relationship with the Cubs.\n\n===Tribune Company years (1981\u20132008)===\n\n====1984: Heartbreak====\n{{Main|1984 Chicago Cubs season}}\n[[File:Pic of ryne sandberg from the early 90's.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ryne Sandberg set numerous league and club records in his career and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2005.]]After over a dozen more subpar seasons, in 1981 the Cubs hired GM [[Dallas Green (baseball)|Dallas Green]] from Philadelphia to turn around the franchise. Green had managed the 1980 Phillies to the World Series title. One of his early GM moves brought in a young Phillies minor-league 3rd baseman named Ryne Sandberg, along with Larry Bowa for Iv\u00e1n DeJes\u00fas. The 1983 Cubs had finished 71\u201391 under Lee Elia, who was fired before the season ended by Green. Green continued the culture of change and overhauled the Cubs roster, front-office and coaching staff prior to 1984. [[Jim Frey]] was hired to manage the 1984 Cubs, with [[Don Zimmer]] coaching 3rd base and [[Billy Connors]] serving as pitching coach.\n\nGreen shored<ref name=1984Cubs/> up the 1984 roster with a series of transactions. In December 1983 [[Scott Sanderson (baseball)|Scott Sanderson]] was acquired from Montreal in a three-team deal with San Diego for [[Carmelo Mart\u00ednez]]. Pinch hitter [[Richie Hebner]] (.333 BA in 1984) was signed as a free-agent. In spring training, moves continued: LF [[Gary Matthews]] and CF [[Bobby Dernier]] came from Philadelphia on March 26, for [[Bill Campbell (baseball)|Bill Campbell]] and a minor leaguer. Reliever Tim Stoddard (10\u20136 3.82, 7 saves) was acquired the same day for a minor leaguer; veteran pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was released.\n\nThe team's commitment to contend was complete when Green made a midseason deal on June 15 to shore up the starting rotation due to injuries to [[Rick Reuschel]] (5\u20135) and Sanderson. The deal brought 1979 NL Rookie of the Year pitcher [[Rick Sutcliffe]] from the Cleveland Indians. [[Joe Carter]] (who was with the Triple-A [[Iowa Cubs]] at the time) and right fielder [[Mel Hall]] were sent to Cleveland for Sutcliffe and back-up catcher Ron Hassey (.333 with Cubs in 1984). Sutcliffe (5\u20135 with the Indians) immediately joined Sanderson (8\u20135 3.14), Eckersley (10\u20138 3.03), [[Steve Trout]] (13\u20137 3.41) and [[Dick Ruthven]] (6\u201310 5.04) in the starting rotation. Sutcliffe proceeded to go 16\u20131 for Cubs and capture the [[Cy Young Award]].<ref name=1984Cubs/>\n\nThe Cubs 1984 starting lineup was very strong.<ref name=1984Cubs/> It consisted of LF Matthews (.291 14\u201382 101 runs 17 SB), C [[Jody Davis (baseball)|Jody Davis]] (.256 19\u201394), RF [[Keith Moreland]] (.279 16\u201380), SS [[Larry Bowa]] (.223 10 SB), 1B [[Leon \"Bull\" Durham]] (.279 23\u201396 16SB), CF Dernier (.278 45 SB), 3B [[Ron Cey]] (.240 25\u201397), Closer [[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]] (9\u20137 3.65 33 saves) and 1984 NL MVP [[Ryne Sandberg]] (.314 19\u201384 114 runs, 19 triples, 32 SB).<ref name=1984Cubs>{{cite web |url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1984.shtml |title = 1984 Chicago Cubs Batting, Pitching, & Fielding Statistics |work = Baseball-Reference.com |access-date = August 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nReserve players Hebner, [[Thad Bosley]], [[Henry Cotto]], Hassey and [[Dave Owen (baseball)|Dave Owen]] produced exciting moments. The bullpen depth of [[Rich Bordi]], [[George Frazier (pitcher)|George Frazier]], [[Warren Brusstar]] and [[Dickie Noles]] did their job in getting the game to Smith or Stoddard.\n\nAt the top of the order, Dernier and Sandberg were exciting, aptly coined \"the Daily Double\" by [[Harry Caray]]. With strong defense \u2013 Dernier CF and Sandberg 2B, won the NL [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]]- solid pitching and clutch hitting, the Cubs were a well-balanced team. Following the \"Daily Double\", Matthews, Durham, Cey, Moreland and Davis gave the Cubs an order with no gaps to pitch around. Sutcliffe anchored a strong top-to-bottom rotation, and Smith was one of the top closers in the game.\n\nThe shift in the Cubs' fortunes was characterized June 23 on the [[Major League Baseball on NBC|\"NBC Saturday Game of the Week\"]] contest against the St. Louis Cardinals; it has since been dubbed simply \"[[The Sandberg Game]]\". With the nation watching and Wrigley Field packed, Sandberg emerged as a superstar with not one, but two game-tying home runs against Cardinals closer [[Bruce Sutter]]. With his shots in the 9th and 10th innings, Wrigley Field erupted and Sandberg set the stage for a comeback win that cemented the Cubs as the team to beat in the East. No one would catch them.\n\nIn early August the Cubs swept the Mets in a 4-game home series that further distanced them from the pack. An infamous Keith Moreland-[[Ed Lynch (baseball)|Ed Lynch]] fight erupted after Lynch hit Moreland with a pitch, perhaps forgetting Moreland was once a linebacker at the University of Texas. It was the second game of a doubleheader and the Cubs had won the first game in part due to a three-run home run by Moreland. After the bench-clearing fight, the Cubs won the second game, and the sweep put the Cubs at 68\u201345.\n\nIn 1984, each league had two divisions, East and West. The divisional winners met in a best-of-5 series to advance to the World Series, in a \"2\u20133\" format, first two games were played at the home of the team who did not have home-field advantage. Then the last three games were played at the home of the team, with home-field advantage. Thus the first two games were played at Wrigley Field and the next three at the home of their opponents, San Diego. A common and unfounded myth is that since Wrigley Field did not have lights at that time the National League decided to give the home field advantage to the winner of the NL West. In fact, home-field advantage had rotated between the winners of the East and West since 1969 when the league expanded. In even-numbered years, the NL West had home-field advantage. In odd-numbered years, the NL East had home-field advantage. Since the NL East winners had had home-field advantage in 1983, the NL West winners were entitled to it.\n\nThe confusion may stem from the fact that Major League Baseball did decide that, should the Cubs make it to the World Series, the American League winner would have home-field advantage.  At the time home field advantage was rotated between each league. Odd-numbered years the AL had home-field advantage. Even-numbered years the NL had home-field advantage. In the 1982 World Series the St. Louis Cardinals of the NL had home-field advantage. In the 1983 World Series the Baltimore Orioles of the AL had home-field advantage.\n\nIn the [[1984 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], the Cubs easily won the first two games at Wrigley Field against the [[1984 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]]. The Padres were the winners of the Western Division with [[Steve Garvey]], [[Tony Gwynn]], [[Eric Show]], [[Goose Gossage]] and [[Alan Wiggins]]. With wins of 13\u20130 and 4\u20132, the Cubs needed to win only one game of the next three in San Diego to make it to the World Series. After being beaten in Game 3 7\u20131, the Cubs lost Game 4 when Smith, with the game tied 5\u20135, allowed a game-winning home run to Garvey in the bottom of the ninth inning. In Game 5 the Cubs took a 3\u20130 lead into the 6th inning, and a 3\u20132 lead into the seventh with Sutcliffe (who won the [[Cy Young Award]] that year) still on the mound. Then, Leon Durham had a sharp grounder go under his glove. This critical error helped the Padres win the game 6\u20133, with a 4-run 7th inning and keep Chicago out of the [[1984 World Series]] against the [[Detroit Tigers]]. The loss ended a spectacular season for the Cubs, one that brought alive a slumbering franchise and made the Cubs relevant for a whole new generation of Cubs fans.\n\nThe Padres would be defeated in 5 games by Sparky Anderson's Tigers in the World Series.\n\n[[File:Andre Dawson (August 1988).jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Andre Dawson]], 5\u00d7 All-Star and 1987 NL MVP during tenure in Chicago]]The 1985 season brought high hopes. The club started out well, going 35\u201319 through mid-June, but injuries to Sutcliffe and others in the pitching staff contributed to a 13-game losing streak that pushed the Cubs out of contention.\n\n====1989: NL East division championship====\n{{Main|1989 Chicago Cubs season}}\nIn 1989, the first full season with night baseball at Wrigley Field, [[Don Zimmer]]'s Cubs were led by a core group of veterans in [[Ryne Sandberg]], [[Rick Sutcliffe]] and [[Andre Dawson]], who were boosted by a crop of youngsters such as [[Mark Grace]], [[Shawon Dunston]], [[Greg Maddux]], Rookie of the Year [[Jerome Walton]], and Rookie of the Year Runner-Up Dwight Smith. The Cubs won the NL East once again that season winning 93 games. This time the Cubs met the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the [[1989 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. After splitting the first two games at home, the Cubs headed to the Bay Area, where despite holding a lead at some point in each of the next three games, bullpen meltdowns and managerial blunders ultimately led to three straight losses. The Cubs could not overcome the efforts of Will Clark, whose home run off Maddux, just after a managerial visit to the mound, led Maddux to think Clark knew what pitch was coming. Afterward, Maddux would speak into his glove during any mound conversation, beginning what is a norm today. Mark Grace was 11\u201317 in the series with 8 RBI. Eventually, the Giants lost to the \"[[Bash Brothers]]\" and the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the famous \"''[[1989 World Series|Earthquake Series]]''\".\n\n====1998: Wild card race and home run chase====\n[[File:Sosa swinging2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Sammy Sosa]] was the captain of the Chicago Cubs during his tenure with the team.]]\n{{Main|1998 Chicago Cubs season|1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase}}\nThe 1998 season began on a somber note with the death of broadcaster [[Harry Caray]]. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill, and the signing of [[Henry Rodr\u00edguez (outfielder)|Henry Rodr\u00edguez]] to bat cleanup provided protection for [[Sammy Sosa]] in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. [[Kevin Tapani]] led the club with a career-high 19 wins while [[Rod Beck]] anchored a strong bullpen and [[Mark Grace]] turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower [[Kerry Wood]]. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the [[1998 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]], a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname ''\"Kid K\",'' and ultimately earned him the 1998 [[NL Rookie of the Year]] award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinal's slugger [[Mark McGwire]] transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the [[National League MVP Award]]. After a down-to-the-wire [[Wild card (sports)|Wild Card]] chase with the [[1998 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field. Third baseman [[Gary Gaetti]] hit the eventual game-winning homer in the playoff game. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason for the first time since 1989 with a 90\u201373 regular-season record. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager [[Jim Riggleman]]'s club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by [[1998 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta]] in the [[1998 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/3375336|title=1998 marked banner year for Cubs|website=Major League Baseball|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-20|archive-date=2016-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023133722/http://m.mlb.com/news/article/3375336|url-status=dead}}</ref> The home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and [[Ken Griffey Jr.]] helped professional baseball to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|1994 strike]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Sosa discusses future, McGwire's Hall chances |date = December 4, 2006 |publisher = [[ESPN]] |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2683234 |agency = Associated Press |access-date = June 11, 2008 }}</ref> The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in 1998, but, after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again (starting with being swept at the hands of the cross-town [[1998 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] in mid-June) and finished in the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.\n\n====2001: Playoff push====\n{{Main|2001 Chicago Cubs season}}\nDespite losing fan favorite Grace to free agency and the lack of production from newcomer [[Todd Hundley]], skipper [[Don Baylor]]'s Cubs put together a good season in 2001.

On July 5, 2002, the Cubs promoted assistant general manager and player personnel director [[Jim Hendry]] to the General Manager position. The club responded by hiring [[Dusty Baker]] and by making some major moves in 2003. Most notably, they traded with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for outfielder [[Kenny Lofton]] and third baseman [[Aramis Ram\u00edrez]], and rode dominant pitching, led by Kerry Wood and [[Mark Prior]], as the Cubs led the division down the stretch.\n\n[[File:Kerry Wood 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kerry Wood]], along with Mark Prior, led the Cubs' rotation in 2003.]]\n\nChicago halted St. Louis' run to the playoffs by taking four of five games from the Cardinals at Wrigley Field in early September, after which they won their first division title in 14 years. They then went on to defeat the [[2003 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in a dramatic five-game [[2003 National League Division Series|Division Series]], the franchise's first postseason series win since beating the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the [[1908 World Series]].\n\nAfter losing an extra-inning game in Game 1, the Cubs rallied and took a three-games-to-one lead over the Wild Card [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] in the [[2003 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]].

Apparently handcuffed by the Tribune's bankruptcy and the sale of the club to the Ricketts siblings, led by chairman [[Thomas S. Ricketts]], the [[2009 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]]' quest for a NL Central three-peat started with notice that there would be less invested into contracts than in previous years. Chicago engaged [[2009 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] in a see-saw battle for first place into August 2009, but the Cardinals played to a torrid 20\u20136 pace that month, designating their rivals to battle in the Wild Card race, from which they were eliminated in the season's final week. The Cubs were plagued by injuries in 2009, and were only able to field their Opening Day starting lineup three times the entire season. Third baseman Aramis Ram\u00edrez injured his throwing shoulder in an early May game against the Milwaukee Brewers, sidelining him until early July and forcing journeyman players like [[Mike Fontenot]] and [[Aaron Miles]] into more prominent roles. Additionally, key players like Derrek Lee (who still managed to hit .306 with 35 home runs and 111 RBI that season), Alfonso Soriano, and Geovany Soto also nursed nagging injuries. The Cubs posted a winning record (83\u201378) for the third consecutive season, the first time the club had done so since [[1972 Chicago Cubs season|1972]], and a new era of ownership under the Ricketts family was approved by MLB owners in early October.\n\n====2010\u20132014: The decline and rebuild====\n{{Main|2010 Chicago Cubs season|2011 Chicago Cubs season|2012 Chicago Cubs season|2013 Chicago Cubs season|2014 Chicago Cubs season}}\n[[File:Starlin Castro 09-05-2010.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Starlin Castro]] during his 2010 rookie season]]Rookie [[Starlin Castro]] debuted in early May (2010) as the starting shortstop. The club played poorly in the early season, finding themselves 10 games under .500 at the end of June. In addition, long-time ace Carlos Zambrano was pulled from a game against the White Sox on June 25 after a tirade and shoving match with Derrek Lee, and was suspended indefinitely by Jim Hendry, who called the conduct \"unacceptable\". On August 22, Lou Piniella, who had already announced his retirement at the end of the season, announced that he would leave the Cubs prematurely to take care of his sick mother. [[Mike Quade]] took over as the interim manager for the final 37 games of the year.

Although the team had a dismal 2012 season, losing 101 games (the worst record since 1966), it was largely expected. The youth movement ushered in by Epstein and Hoyer began as longtime fan favorite Kerry Wood retired in May, followed by [[Ryan Dempster]] and [[Geovany Soto]] being traded to [[2012 Texas Rangers season|Texas]] at the All-Star break for a group of minor league prospects headlined by [[Christian Villanueva]], but also included little thought of [[Kyle Hendricks]]. The development of Castro, [[Anthony Rizzo (baseball)|Anthony Rizzo]], [[Darwin Barney]], [[Brett Jackson]] and pitcher [[Jeff Samardzija]], as well as the replenishing of the minor-league system with prospects such as [[Javier Baez]], [[Albert Almora]], and [[Jorge Soler]] became the primary focus of the season, a philosophy which the new management said would carry over at least through the 2013 season.\n[[File:Anthony Rizzo 2012.jpg|thumb|right|180px|One of two Cubs building blocks, [[Anthony Rizzo]], swinging in the box]]\nThe [[2013 Chicago Cubs season|2013 season]] resulted in much as the same the year before.

It was built in 1914 as '''Weeghman Park''' for the [[Chicago Whales]], a [[Federal League]] baseball team. The Cubs also shared the park with the [[Chicago Bears]] of the NFL for 50 years. The ballpark includes a manual scoreboard, ivy-covered brick walls, and relatively small dimensions.\n\nLocated in Chicago's [[Lake View, Chicago|Lake View]] neighborhood, Wrigley Field sits on an irregular block bounded by Clark and Addison Streets and Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. The area surrounding the ballpark is typically referred to as Wrigleyville. There is a dense collection of sports bars and restaurants in the area, most with baseball-inspired themes, including Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers and [[The Cubby Bear]]. Many of the apartment buildings surrounding Wrigley Field on Waveland and Sheffield Avenues have built bleachers on their [[Wrigley Rooftops|rooftops]] for fans to view games and other sell space for advertisement. One building on Sheffield Avenue has a sign atop its roof which says \"Eamus Catuli!\" which roughly translates into [[Latin]] as \"Let's Go Cubs!\" and another chronicles the years since the last Division title, National League pennant, and World Series championship. On game days, many residents rent out their yards and driveways to people looking for parking spots. The uniqueness of the neighborhood itself has ingrained itself into the culture of the Chicago Cubs as well as the Wrigleyville neighborhood, and has led to being used for concerts and other sporting events, such as the 2010 [[NHL Winter Classic]] between the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and [[Detroit Red Wings]], as well as a 2010 [[NCAA]] men's football game between the [[Northwestern Wildcats]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini]].\n\nIn 2013, Tom Ricketts and team president Crane Kenney unveiled plans for a five-year, $575&nbsp;million privately funded renovation of Wrigley Field.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/05/01/photos-of-planned-wrigley-renovations-revealed/ |title = Photos Of Planned Wrigley Renovation Revealed |work = CBS Chicago |location = Chicago |publisher = WBBM-TV |date = May 1, 2013 |access-date = July 7, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title = Cubs Hint at Paying for Renovations |first = Ben |last = Strauss |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/baseball/cubs-unveil-wrigley-field-plans-hinting-at-picking-up-tab.html |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = January 20, 2013 |access-date = January 23, 2013 }}</ref> Called the 1060 Project, the proposed plans included vast improvements to the stadium's facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, [[press box]], [[bullpen]]s, and clubhouses, as well as a {{convert|6,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[jumbotron]] to be added in the left field bleachers, [[Batting cage|batting tunnels]], a {{convert|3,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} video board in right field, and, eventually, an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.<ref>{{cite news |title = Selling of Wrigley Field Renovation Plan Begins |first = Paul |last = Sullivan |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-20/sports/chi-wrigley-20130120_1_cubs-plan-wrigley-field-president-crane-kenney |newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] |date = January 20, 2013 |access-date = January 23, 2013 }}</ref> In previous years mostly all efforts to conduct any large-scale renovations to the field had been opposed by the city, former mayor [[Richard M.

Wrigley and the 1937 bleacher/scoreboard reconstruction, and prior to modern media saturation, a flag with either a \"W\" or an \"L\" has flown from atop the scoreboard masthead, indicating the day's result(s) when baseball was played at Wrigley. In case of a split [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]], both the \"W\" and \"L\" flags are flown.\n\nPast Cubs media guides show that originally the flags were blue with a white \"W\" and white with a blue \"L\". In 1978, consistent with the dominant colors of the flags, blue and white lights were mounted atop the scoreboard, denoting \"win\" and \"loss\" respectively for the benefit of nighttime passers-by.\n\nThe flags were replaced by 1990, the first year in which the Cubs media guide reports the switch to the now-familiar colors of the flags: White with blue \"W\" and blue with white \"L\". In addition to needing to replace the worn-out flags, by then the retired numbers of Banks and Williams were flying on the foul poles, as white with blue numbers; so the \"good\" flag was switched to match that scheme.\n\nThis long-established tradition has evolved to fans carrying the white-with-blue-W flags to both home and away games, and displaying them after a Cub win. The flags are known as the [[Cubs Win Flag]]. The flags have become more and more popular each season since 1998, and are now even sold as T-shirts with the same layout. In 2009, the tradition spilled over to the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] as [[Chicago Blackhawks]] fans adopted a red and black \"W\" flag of their own.\n\nDuring the early and mid-2000s, Chip Caray usually declared that a Cubs win at home meant it was \"White flag time at Wrigley!\" More recently, the Cubs have promoted the phrase \"Fly the W!\" among fans and on social media.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/mets/index.ssf/2015/10/celebrities_mets_players_go_crazy_on_twitter_after.html|title=Mets' Noah Syndergaard mocks Cubs' 'Fly the W' on Twitter after NLCS win|last=Curtis|first=Charles|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Mascots ===\n[[File:Clark-the-Cub-01.jpg|thumb|right|Clark (left) with the Oriole Bird]]\n{{See also|Clark (mascot)}}\nThe official Cubs team [[mascot]] is a young bear cub, named [[Clark (mascot)|Clark]], described by the team's press release as a young and friendly Cub.

There is no record of whether or not he was just a fan in a costume or employed by the club.  Through the 2013 season, there were \"Cubbie-bear\" mascots outside of Wrigley on game day, but none were employed by the team. They pose for pictures with fans for tips. The most notable of these was \"Billy Cub\" who worked outside of the stadium for over six years until July 2013, when the club asked him to stop. Billy Cub, who is played by fan John Paul Weier, had unsuccessfully petitioned the team to become the official mascot.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?id=9181458 |title = Chicago Cubs tell unofficial 'Billy Cub' mascot to stop &#124; abc7chicago.com |publisher = Abclocal.go.com |date = 2013-07-22 |access-date = August 1, 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140116083630/http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?id=9181458 |archive-date = January 16, 2014 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAnother unofficial but much more well-known mascot is [[Ronnie Woo Woo|Ronnie \"Woo Woo\" Wickers]]<ref name=A>{{cite news |first = William |last = Hageman |title = A Fan in Winter |work = Chicago Tribune |date = February 27, 2004 }}</ref> who is a longtime fan and local celebrity in the Chicago area.

Holy Mackerel! (The Cubs Song)\" whose title and lyrics incorporated the catch-phrases of the respective TV and radio announcers for the Cubs, [[Jack Brickhouse]] and [[Vince Lloyd]]. Several members of the Cubs recorded an album called ''Cub Power'' which contained a cover of the song. The song received a good deal of local airplay that summer, associating it very strongly with that season. It was played much less frequently thereafter, although it remained an unofficial Cubs theme song for some years after.\n\nFor many years, Cubs radio broadcasts started with \"It's a Beautiful Day for a Ball Game\" by the Harry Simeone Chorale.

The trio began playing together with the Cubs in 1902, and formed a double-play combination that lasted through April 1912.

The terms \"North Siders\" and \"South Siders\" are synonymous with the respective teams and their fans as Wrigley Field is located in the North side of the city while [[Guaranteed Rate Field]] is in the South, setting up an enduring cross-town rivalry with the White Sox.\n\nNotably this rivalry predates the [[Interleague Play]] Era, with the only postseason meeting against the Sox occurring in the [[1906 World Series]]. It was the first [[World Series]] between teams from the same city. The [[1906 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] won the series 4 games to 2, over the highly favored [[1906 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] who had won a record 116 games during the regular season. The rivalry continued through of exhibition games, culminating in the Crosstown Classic from 1985 to 1995, in which the White Sox were undefeated at 10\u20130\u20132. The White Sox currently lead the regular season series 72\u201364.\n\n==Uniforms==\n===Home===\nThe Cubs currently wear pinstriped white uniforms at home. This design dates back to 1957 when the Cubs debuted the first version of the uniform. The basic look has the Cubs logo on the left chest, along with blue pinstripes and blue numbers. A left sleeve patch featuring the cub head logo was added in 1962. This design was then tweaked to include a red circle and angrier expression in 1979, before returning to a cuter version in 1994. In 1997, the patch was changed to the current \"walking cub\" logo. During this period the uniform received a few alterations, going from zippers to pullovers with sleeve stripes to the current buttoned look. The primary Cubs logo also received thicker letters and circle, while blue numbers received red trim and player names were added.\n\n===Road===\nThe Cubs' road gray uniform has been in use since 1997. This design has \"Chicago\" in blue letters with white trim arranged in a radial arch, along with red chest numbers with white trim. The back of the uniform has player names in blue with white trim, and numbers in red with white trim. This set also features the \"walking cub\" patch on the left sleeve.\n\n===Alternate===\nThe Cubs also wear a blue alternate uniform. The current design, first introduced in 1997, has the \"walking cub\" logo on the left chest, along with red letters and numbers with white trim. Prior to 2023, the National League logo took its place on the right sleeve; this has since been removed in anticipation of a future advertisement patch. The Cubs alternates are usually worn on road games, though in the past it was also worn at home, and at one point, a home blue version minus the player's name was used as well.\n\nAll three designs are paired with an all-blue cap with the red \"C\" trimmed in white, which was first worn in 1959.\n\n===City Connect===\nBeginning in 2021, Major League Baseball and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] introduced the \"City Connect\" series, featuring uniquely designed uniforms inspired by each city's community and personality. The Cubs' design is navy blue with light blue accents on both the uniform and pants, and features the \"Wrigleyville\" wordmark inspired by the Wrigley Field marquee. Caps are navy blue with a light blue brim, and features the trademark \"C\" crest in white with light blue trim, along with the red six-point star inside. The left sleeve patch features the full team name inside a navy circle, along with a specially designed [[Municipal device of Chicago|municipal device]] incorporating the [[Flag of Chicago|Chicago city flag]].\n\n===Past designs===\nPrior to unveiling their current look, the Cubs went through a variety of uniform looks in their early years, incorporating either a \"standing cub\" logo, a primitive version of the \"C-UBS\" logo, a \"wishbone C\" mark (later adopted by the [[Chicago Bears]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]]), or the team or city name in various fonts. The uniform itself went from having pinstripes to racing stripes and chest piping. Navy blue and sometimes red served as the team colors through the mid-1940s when the team switched to the more familiar royal blue and red color scheme.\n\nAfter unveiling the first version of what later became their current home uniform in 1957, the Cubs went through various changes with the road uniform. It had the full team name in red letters for its first season, before going to a more basic city name in blue letters with red trim. A cub head logo was also added to the sleeves in 1962, with several alterations coming afterward. By 1969, the red trim was removed, and chest numbers were added. Switching to pullovers in 1972, the Cubs' road uniform remained gray, but the chest numbers were moved to the middle before returning to the left side the following year. This was then changed to a powder blue base in 1976, added pinstripes in 1978, and added player names the following year. From 1982 to 1989, the Cubs wore blue tops with plain white pants for road games, featuring the primary Cubs logo in front and red letters with white trim.\n\nIn 1990, the Cubs returned to wearing gray uniforms with buttons on the road. However, it also went through some cosmetic changes, from a straight \"Chicago\" wordmark with red chest numbers (later with a taller font and red back numbers), to a script \"Cubs\" wordmark written diagonally. A blue alternate uniform returned in 1994, also incorporating the script \"Cubs\" wordmark in red minus the chest numbers. This was then changed to the \"walking cub\" logo in 1997, which was also incorporated as a sleeve patch on the road uniform. From 1994 to 2008, the Cubs also wore an alternate road blue cap with red brim.

The park seats 15,000, making it Major League baseball's largest spring training facility by capacity. The Cubs annually sell out most of their games both at home and on the road. Before Sloan Park opened in 2014, the team played games at [[HoHoKam Park]] \u2013 Dwight Patterson Field from 1979. \"HoHoKam\" is literally translated from Native American as \"those who vanished\". The North Siders have called Mesa their spring home for most seasons since 1952.\n\nIn addition to Mesa, the club has held spring training in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] (1886, 1896\u20131900), (1909\u20131910) [[Sports in New Orleans#Baseball|New Orleans]] (1870, 1907, 1911\u20131912); [[Champaign, Illinois]] (1901\u201302, 1906); Los Angeles (1903\u201304, 1948\u20131949), [[Santa Monica, California]] (1905); [[French Lick, Indiana]] (1908, 1943\u20131945); [[Tampa, Florida]] (1913\u20131916); [[Pasadena, California]] (1917\u20131921); [[Santa Catalina Island, California]] (1922\u20131942, 1946\u20131947, 1950\u20131951); Rendezvous Park in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]] (1952\u20131965); [[Blair Field]] in [[Long Beach, California]] (1966); and [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] (1967\u20131978).\n\nThe curious location on Catalina Island stemmed from Cubs owner William Wrigley Jr.'s then-majority interest in the island in 1919. Wrigley constructed a ballpark on the island to house the Cubs in spring training: it was built to the same dimensions as Wrigley Field. The ballpark was called Wrigley Field of Avalon.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.digitalballparks.com/SpringTraining/Catalina.html |title = Avalon's Wrigley Field \u2013 Catalina Island California \u2013 Former Spring Home of the Chicago Cubs }}</ref> (The ballpark is long gone, but a clubhouse built by Wrigley to house the Cubs exists as the Catalina County Club.)
