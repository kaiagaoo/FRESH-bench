This club, the first ancestor of Sporting, played just one match and at the end of the year's summer, disbanded. Two years later, the idea of creating a football club was revived, and this time, with the Gavazzo brothers joined by [[Jos\u00e9 Alvalade]] (Jos\u00e9 Holtreman Roquette) and Jos\u00e9 Stromp: a new club, the ''Campo Grande Football Club'', was founded. They played their matches on the estate of the [[Alfredo Augusto das Neves Holtreman, 1st Viscount of Alvalade|Viscount of Alvalade (Alfredo Holtreman)]], Jos\u00e9 Alvalade's grandfather, with the club's headquarters located in Francisco Gavazzo's home. \n\nFor two years, the club developed an intense activity on several sports, namely football, [[tennis]] and [[fencing]].[[File:Jos\u00e9 de alvalade.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Jos\u00e9 Alvalade]] founded Sporting with the backing of his grandfather.]]The club also organized parties and picnics. Eventually, during one picnic, on 12 April 1906, discussions erupted, as some members defended that the club should only be focused on organizing picnics and social events, with another group defending that the club should be focused on the practising of sports instead. Some time later, Jos\u00e9 Gavazzo, Jos\u00e9 Alvalade and 17 other members left the club, with Jos\u00e9 Alvalade saying, \"I'll go to my grandad and he'll give me money to make another club.\"<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-04-21 |title=O Sporting \u00e9 fruto do amor de um av\u00f4 pelo seu neto |url=https://www.dn.pt/desporto/o-sporting-e-fruto-do-amor-de-um-avo-pelo-seu-neto-6234009.html |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=www.dn.pt |language=pt-PT |archive-date=31 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231031000749/https://www.dn.pt/desporto/o-sporting-e-fruto-do-amor-de-um-avo-pelo-seu-neto-6234009.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting.pt/en/club/museum/featured-areas|title=Museum featured areas|website=Sporting CP|date=26 November 2014|access-date=7 December 2015|archive-date=20 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120134942/http://www.sporting.pt/en/club/museum/featured-areas|url-status=live}}</ref> As such, a new club, without a name, was founded on 8 May 1906, and on 26 May, it was named \"Campo Grande Sporting Clube\".{{efn|name=foundation}} The Viscount of Alvalade, whose money and land helped found the club, was the first president of Sporting.<ref name=\"scphistory\">{{cite web|title=Resumo Hist\u00f3rico|date=10 March 2015|trans-title=Historical Summary|url=https://www.sporting.pt/pt/clube|publisher=Sporting Clube de Portugal|access-date=22 September 2018|archive-date=11 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911191627/https://www.sporting.pt/pt/clube|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Montero |first=Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds |date=2015-10-18 |title=O Passado Tamb\u00e9m Chuta: O Visconde de Alvalade |url=https://bolanarede.pt/rubricas/o-passado-tambem-chuta/o-passado-tambem-chuta-o-visconde-de-alvalade/ |access-date=2023-11-15 |website=Bola na Rede |language=pt-PT |archive-date=15 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231115125644/https://bolanarede.pt/rubricas/o-passado-tambem-chuta/o-passado-tambem-chuta-o-visconde-de-alvalade/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Jos\u00e9 Alvalade, as one of the main founders, uttered on behalf of himself and his fellow co-founders, \"We want this club to be a great club, as great as the greatest in Europe.\"<ref name=\"scphistory\" /> Three months later, on 1 July 1906,{{efn|name=foundation}} Ant\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa J\u00fanior suggested the name ''Sporting Clube de Portugal'', and since 1920 that is their foundation date.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Clube |url=https://www.sporting.pt/pt/tax_noticias/clube?page=237 |access-date=2023-11-02 |website=www.sporting.pt |language=pt-pt |archive-date=2 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231102004200/https://www.sporting.pt/pt/tax_noticias/clube?page=237 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{efn|name=foundation}}\n\n===Early years (1907\u20131946)===\n[[File:viscondedealvalade.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Alfredo Holtreman]], Viscount of Alvalade was the first president, sponsor and protector of Sporting.]]The year 1907 marked some \"firsts\" for the club, as Sporting played the first football match of their history on 3 February, ending in a 5\u20131 defeat against third division club ''Cruz Negra;'' inaugurated their first ground, known as \"''S\u00edtio das Mouras''\" (the most advanced in Portugal at the time, equipped with showers, two tennis courts, an athletics track and a football field) on 4 July; and played the first derby of all time against local rivals [[S.L.
