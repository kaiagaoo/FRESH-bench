This club, the first ancestor of Sporting, played just one match and at the end of the year's summer, disbanded. Two years later, the idea of creating a football club was revived, and this time, with the Gavazzo brothers joined by [[Jos\u00e9 Alvalade]] (Jos\u00e9 Holtreman Roquette) and Jos\u00e9 Stromp: a new club, the ''Campo Grande Football Club'', was founded. They played their matches on the estate of the [[Alfredo Augusto das Neves Holtreman, 1st Viscount of Alvalade|Viscount of Alvalade (Alfredo Holtreman)]], Jos\u00e9 Alvalade's grandfather, with the club's headquarters located in Francisco Gavazzo's home.

The club also organized parties and picnics. Eventually, during one picnic, on 12 April 1906, discussions erupted, as some members defended that the club should only be focused on organizing picnics and social events, with another group defending that the club should be focused on the practising of sports instead. Some time later, Jos\u00e9 Gavazzo, Jos\u00e9 Alvalade and 17 other members left the club, with the latter saying, \"I am going to have with me my grandfather and he will give me the money to make another club.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting.pt/en/club/museum/featured-areas|title=Museum featured areas|website=Sporting CP|access-date=7 December 2015}}</ref> As such, a new club, ''Sporting Clube de Portugal'', was founded.

Beginning its activity as ''Sporting Club of Portugal Bulletin'' on 31 March 1922, it was initially an eight-page calendar, with the optional payment of $2 a semester. Under the direction of Artur da Cunha Rosa, the bulletin became known as a newspaper in June 1952.\n\n===Sporting TV===\n{{main|Sporting TV}}\n\nSporting TV is the television channel of Sporting. Open channel, the channel is present in the private operators [[MEO (Portugal)|MEO]] and [[NOS (Portuguese media company)|NOS]], in channels 34 and 35, and in Angola, through the operator [[ZAP (satellite television)|ZAP]]. The channel broadcasts several sporting events linked to Sporting.\n\n===Museum===\nInaugurated on 31 August 2004, Sporting Museum is divided into several thematic areas that express the wealth of the club's heritage and its sporting achievements over more than a century of existence in thirty-two different modalities. About two thousand trophies are on display, and there are many others in store.\n\nThe history of the museum dates back to the trophy room of the old headquarters on Rua do Pasadinho, where in 1956, 1850 trophies were already stored. In 1994, President Sousa Cintra inaugurated a new trophy room, where less than half of the club's collections were exhibited. The following year the remodeling and organization of the museum is promoted, and a conservative is incorporated. During the construction of the new [[Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade]] a new museum is inaugurated, culminating in four years of investigation. Throughout the years, through donations with several origins, in addition to the trophies the patrimony of the club never stopped growing. In July 2016, there was a new inauguration after a total renovation.\n\n==Club officials==\n{{updated|26 June 2021}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting.pt/English/Club/club_governingbodies.asp|title=Governing Bodies|publisher=Sporting.pt|access-date=2013-04-01|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027064517/http://www.sporting.pt/English/Club/club_governingbodies.asp|archive-date=27 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Directive Board===\n{{See also|List of Sporting Clube de Portugal presidents}}\n* President: Frederico Varandas\n* Vice-presidents: Carlos Vieira, [[Jos\u00e9 Vicente de Moura|Vicente Moura]], V\u00edtor Silva Ferreira, Ant\u00f3nio Rebelo\n* Board members: Bruno Mascarenhas Garcia, Lu\u00eds Roque, Rui Caeiro, Alexandre Henriques, Jos\u00e9 Quintela\n* Substitutes: Rita Matos, Lu\u00eds Gestas, Jorge Sanches, Lu\u00eds Loureiro\n\n===General Assembly===\n* President: Rog\u00e9rio Alves\n* Vice-president: Rui Solheiro\n* Secretaries: Miguel de Castro, Lu\u00eds Pereira, Tiago Abade\n* Substitutes: Diogo Orvalho, Manuel Mendes, Rui Fernandes\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Official website}} {{in lang|pt|en}}\n*[https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2015/clubs/club=50149/index.html Sporting CP at UEFA]\n\n{{Sporting CP}}\n{{Original Primeira Liga clubs}}\n{{Portuguese Liga}}\n{{UEFA Cup Winners' Cup winners}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sporting CP}}\n[[Category:Sporting CP| ]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on Euronext Lisbon]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1906]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Publicly traded sports companies]]\n[[Category:Sport in Lisbon]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1906]]\n[[Category:1906 establishments in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Unrelegated association football clubs]]\n[[Category:Ta\u00e7a de Portugal winners]]\n[[Category:Primeira Liga clubs]]\n[[Category:UEFA Cup Winners' Cup winning clubs]]"}
