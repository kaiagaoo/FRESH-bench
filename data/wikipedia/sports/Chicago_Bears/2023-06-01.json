Their rivalry with the [[Arizona Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]], the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rival from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles. During the league's first six years, the Bears lost twice to the [[Canton Bulldogs]] (who took two league titles over that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4\u20134\u20132 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 shutouts.\n\nThe Bears' rivalry with the [[Green Bay Packers]] is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921 (the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Brian |title=Love-Hate Relationship: Bears-Packers Rivalry Always Bittersweet |url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |publisher=Green Bay Packers |date=September 28, 2000 |access-date=June 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107015852/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |archive-date=January 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1924bears.jpg|left|thumb|The 1924 team photo]]The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in {{nfly|1921}} and remaining competitive throughout the decade.

They faced the problem of increased operating costs and flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 5,000\u20136,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 40,000\u201350,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers, 21\u20130. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning the team's plays from Bears quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]]. Later in 1925, The Bears would go on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 17\u20137 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together team of West Coast college all-stars.

The Bears also lost star quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]], who joined the [[Chicago Bulls (AFL, 1926)|Chicago Bulls of the AFL]]. The Bears replaced Grange with Paddy Driscoll, a star football player in his own right. The Bears used the money made from the Grange barn-storming tour to sign the man that replaced him. Grange split his time between making movies and playing football. However, the time was not right to have two competing pro football leagues, and the AFL folded after only one season. Grange would return to the Bears.<ref name=\"ChicagoBears\" />\n\nAfter the financial losses of the {{nfly|1932}} Championship season, Halas' partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|1932 \"Unofficial\" NFL Championship]], the Bears defeated the [[Portsmouth Spartans]] in the first indoor American football game at [[Chicago Stadium]].\n\nThe success of the playoff game led the NFL to institute a championship game.

The American television network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired a movie about Piccolo in 1971 entitled ''[[Brian's Song]]'', starring [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] and [[Billy Dee Williams]] in the roles of Piccolo and Sayers respectively; [[Jack Warden]] won an [[Emmy Award]] for his performance as Halas. The movie was later released for theater screenings after first being shown on television. Despite Hall of Fame careers, Butkus and Sayers would also have their careers cut short due to injuries, hamstringing the Bears of this era.\n\nHalas retired as coach in [[1967 Chicago Bears season|1967]] and spent the rest of his days in the front office. He became the only person to be involved with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first induction class in 1963. As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 [[AFL-NFL Merger|merger]] between the NFL and the [[American Football League]], the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the [[National Football Conference]], a position that he held until his death in 1983.

His gritty personality earned him the nickname \"Iron Mike\". The team reached the NFC Championship game in 1984. In the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]] season the fire in the Bears\u2013Packers rivalry was re-lit when Ditka used 315-pound defensive tackle [[William Perry (football)|\"Refrigerator\" Perry]] as a running back in a [[touchdown]] play at [[Lambeau Field]], against the Packers. The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the [[AFL-NFL merger]], in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary [[46 defense]] and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song \"[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]\". The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the \"unlucky 13th\" game of the season, a [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]] affair in which they were defeated by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. At the time, much was made of the fact that the {{nfly|1972}} [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] were the only franchise in history to have had an [[perfect season|undefeated season and post-season]].

While both head coaches led the team to the playoffs once (Wannstedt in 1994 and Jauron in 2001), neither was able to accumulate a winning record or bring the Bears back to the Super Bowl.
