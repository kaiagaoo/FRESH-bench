Their rivalry with the [[Arizona Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]], the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rival from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles. During the league's first six years, the Bears lost twice to the [[Canton Bulldogs]] (who took two league titles over that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4\u20134\u20132 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 shutouts.\n\nThe Bears' rivalry with the [[Green Bay Packers]] is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921 (the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Brian |title=Love-Hate Relationship: Bears-Packers Rivalry Always Bittersweet |url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |publisher=Green Bay Packers |date=September 28, 2000 |access-date=June 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107015852/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |archive-date=January 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1924bears.jpg|left|thumb|The 1924 team photo]]The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in {{nfly|1921}} and remaining competitive throughout the decade.

But the NFL had ruled that games after November 30 did not count towards league standings, and the Bears had to settle for second place behind Cleveland.<ref>{{cite web|title=1924: The Third Time is Charmed |work=PFRA |url=http://footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=1924b |access-date=February 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013105712/http://footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=1924b |archive-date=October 13, 2007 }}</ref> Their only losing season came in {{nfly|1929}}.\n\nDuring the 1920s the club was responsible for triggering the NFL's long-standing rule that a player could not be signed until his college's senior class had graduated. The NFL took that action as a consequence of the Bears' aggressive signing of famous University of Illinois player [[Red Grange]] within a day of his final game as a collegian.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Larry  |title=Galloping Ghost scared opponents |url=https://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00014213.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231152202/http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014213.html |archive-date=December 31, 2005 |access-date=December 1, 2005 |website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nDespite much of the on-field success, the Bears were a team in trouble. They faced the problem of increased operating costs and flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 5,000\u20136,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 40,000\u201350,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers, 21\u20130. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning the team's plays from Bears quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]]. Later in 1925, The Bears would go on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 17\u20137 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together team of West Coast college all-stars. After a loss to San Francisco, the Bears cruised to a 60\u20133 over a semi-pro team called the Portland All Stars.<ref name=\"ChicagoBears\">{{cite book |last1=Whittingham |first1=Richard |last2=Ditka |first2=Mike |title=The Chicago Bears: From George Halas to Super Bowl XX |year=1986 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-62885-7 |oclc=13795870 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/chicagobearsfrom0000whit }}</ref>\n\nAny hopes that Grange would lead the Bears to glory in 1926 were quickly dashed. A failed contract talk led to Grange bolting to the AFL's [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]], owned by Pyle. The Bears also lost star quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]], who joined the [[Chicago Bulls (AFL, 1926)|Chicago Bulls of the AFL]]. The Bears replaced Grange with Paddy Driscoll, a star football player in his own right. The Bears used the money made from the Grange barn-storming tour to sign the man that replaced him. Grange split his time between making movies and playing football. However, the time was not right to have two competing pro football leagues, and the AFL folded after only one season. Grange would return to the Bears.<ref name=\"ChicagoBears\" />\n\nAfter the financial losses of the {{nfly|1932}} Championship season, Halas' partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record.
