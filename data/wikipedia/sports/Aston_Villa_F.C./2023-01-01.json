Villa Committee Member [[Frederick Rinder]] was the instigator of a club meeting at Barwick Street in February 1893 that removed the committee running the club at the time. All fourteen committee members resigned and were replaced by a committee of five led by Rinder after he gave a rousing speech criticising the board's tolerance of ill discipline and players' drinking. On the pitch, manager [[George Ramsay]] was moulding a team that became renowned for its short, quick combination passing which saw Villa win its first league title in [[1893-94 Football League|1893\u201394]]; the season after that the club won its second FA Cup in [[1895 FA Cup Final|1894-95]].

A further FA Cup triumph was achieved on the eve of the [[First World War]] in 1913, with the club narrowly missing out on winning a second [[Double (association football)|Double]], finishing runners-up in the league. Star-players during this era included [[Howard Spencer]], the cultured defender who captained both Villa and England, and the prolific strike force of [[Joe Bache]] and [[Harry Hampton (footballer, born 1885)|Harry Hampton]] who between them scored 382 goals in claret and blue.\n\n===Relative decline and first relegation (1920\u20131939)===\n[[File:Billy Walker Footballer.png|thumb|150px|left|A one-club man, [[Billy Walker (footballer, born 1897)|Billy Walker]] scored 244 goals in 531 appearances for Villa between 1920 and 1934.

[[George Ramsay]] retired in 1926, at the age of 71, his replacement [[W. J. Smith|Billy Smith]] was unable to continue Ramsay's success, in reality several other football clubs had caught up with Aston Villa, most notably [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]], who the club finished runners-up to in the league in [[1930\u201331 Football League|1930\u201331]] and [[1932\u201333 Football League|1932\u201333]]. Despite missing out on the league title, Villa Park crowds were entertained by attacking football, the 128 goals scored in 1930\u201331, remains the all-time top-flight record to the present day. A remarkable 49 of the league goals that season were scored by centre-forward [[Tom 'Pongo' Waring]], with another 30 goals from winger [[Eric Houghton]].\n\nThe club appointed [[Jimmy McMullan]] as manager in 1934, however, the move proved disastrous, resulting in Villa's first ever relegation in 1935\u201336 after 48 years in the top flight. Villa struggled largely due to a dismal defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] [[Ted Drake]] in an [[Aston Villa 1\u20137 Arsenal (14 December 1935)|infamous 1\u20137 defeat]] at Villa Park.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 71.</ref> The club made seven signings and spent a staggering sum for the time of \u00a335,500 trying to retain top-flight status at all costs, but were unable to buy their way out of trouble. Aston Villa, at the time one of the most famous and successful clubs in world football, was relegated in 1936 for the first time in its history.\n\nFollowing relegation to the Second Division, the Villa board brought back the ageing former club chairman [[Frederick Rinder|Fred Rinder]], who said on his return \"Villa have been a great club, are still a great club, and always will be a great club\". He was vocal in his criticism of the board for its \"almost total neglect of the reserve team, instead relying on paying big fees for ready made players\". He believed that this change in policy from scouting and developing young homegrown talent led to a decline in the club's culture and style of play, which alongside a tolerance of ill-discipline in the players led to Villa's relegation. Rinder's first act was to travel to Austria to recruit the progressive coach [[Jimmy Hogan]] as manager. Within two seasons, Hogan had guided Villa back to the top flight as Second Division champions playing attractive free-flowing football. Hogan outlined his philosophy: \"I am a teacher and lover of constructive football with every pass, every kick, every movement an object.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-jimmy-hogan-legend-12227795 |title='He'd get you doing stepovers' The intriguing story of an unappreciated Aston Villa legend |date=26 November 2018 |access-date=24 December 2021 |archive-date=24 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211224165149/https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-jimmy-hogan-legend-12227795 |url-status=live }}</ref> He used to tell his players that \"football was like a [[Viennese waltz]], a rhapsody. one-two-three, one-two-three, pass-move-pass, pass-move-pass.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25055156 |title=Jimmy Hogan: The Englishman who inspired the Magical Magyars |work=BBC Sport |access-date=24 December 2021 |archive-date=24 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211224165139/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25055156 |url-status=live }}</ref>.

When [[Danny Blanchflower]] put in a transfer request in 1954 he said that \"the club had grown fat and lazy on its old traditions and the decay was eating at the once solid foundations\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lerwill |first1=John |title=Aston Villa The First Superclub |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-9569833-1-2 |page=213}}</ref> \n\nDespite narrowly avoiding relegation the season before, Aston Villa's first trophy for 37 years came in the 1956\u201357 season when another former Villa player, [[Eric Houghton]] led the club to a then record seventh FA Cup Final win, defeating the 'Busby Babes' of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 2\u20131 with Northern Irish winger [[Peter McParland]] scoring both goals.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; pp. 86\u201387.</ref> The team continued to struggle for consistency in the league though, which led to Eric Houghton being sacked in December 1958. His replacement [[Joe Mercer]] could not prevent the club being relegated for only the second time in their history in [[1958\u201359 Football League|1958-59]]. However, under the stewardship of Mercer, Villa returned to the top-flight in 1960 as Second Division Champions with a talented young side which became known as 'Mercer's Minors'. The following season Aston Villa became the first team to win the [[Football League Cup]] with England centre-forward [[Gerry Hitchens]] scoring an impressive 42 goals in [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960-61]].<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 93.</ref>\n\n===Deep malaise and revival (1961\u20131974)===\nHitchens' goals brought him to the attention of Italian club [[Inter Milan]], who offered him a large financial incentive to sign. He was sold for \u00a385,000 in summer of 1961, his replacement, [[Derek Dougan]] was not a success and Villa slid backwards. Mercer's forced retirement from the club in July 1964, following a stress-induced stroke, signalled a period of deep turmoil and malaise. The most successful club in England had failed to keep pace with changes in the modern game; three of the five-man board of directors were over 70 years old, the club had neglected its scouting network and coaching structure and the club's finances were in a parlous state. This led to the club selling its top striker [[Tony Hateley]] to [[Chelsea FC|Chelsea]] for \u00a3100,000 in October 1966, without his goals Villa were relegated for the third time in its history, under manager [[Dick Taylor (football manager)|Dick Taylor]] in 1967. The board even sold the club's training ground outside Villa Park for housing, leaving the team in the position of training on borrowed training pitches of local factory teams.<ref>{{cite book |last1=James |first1=Gary |title=Joe Mercer Football with a Smile |date=2010 |publisher=James Ward |isbn=978-0-9558127-4-3 |page=140}}</ref>\n\nThe following season the fans called for the board to resign as Villa finished 16th in the Second Division. With mounting debts and Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two, the board sacked [[Tommy Cummings]] (the manager brought in to replace Taylor), and within weeks the entire board resigned under overwhelming pressure from fans.<ref name=\"Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p.100\">Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 100.</ref> After much speculation, control of the club was bought by London financier Pat Matthews, who brought in [[Doug Ellis]] as chairman in December 1968.<ref name=\"Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p.100\" /> Ellis later recalled that \"you could write your name in the dust, window frames were rotting, the smell of failure and imminent financial ruin hung in the air\"; one of their first acts was to raise \u00a3205,835 in a share issue which cleared the club's debts. Doug Ellis's first managerial appointment was the outspoken Scottish manager [[Tommy Docherty]], who after initial success, was sacked after 13 months in charge with the club at the foot of Second Division. His replacement was former club captain and reserve team manager [[Vic Crowe]], who could not prevent Villa being relegated to the Third Division for the first time in its history at the end of the [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370]] season.\n\nThe following season Villa surprised everyone by beating [[Manchester United]] in the two-legged semi-final to reach the [[1971 Football League Cup Final|1971 League Cup Final]], in which the team played well but were defeated by two late [[Tottenham Hotspur]] goals. There was a renewed sense of optimism at Villa Park as the club was promoted to the Second Division as champions with average attendances of 30,000 and a record 70 points in [[1971\u201372 in English football|1971\u201372 season]].<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 106.</ref> Off the pitch, the board purchased the new 20-acre [[Bodymoor Heath Training Ground]] in December 1971, with a view to improving the club's youth development and coaching facilities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sydenham |first1=Richard |title=Ticket to the Moon |date=2018 |publisher=deCoubertin Books |isbn=978-1-909245-76-1 |page=19}}</ref>\n\n=== Back among the elite (1974\u20131992) ===\n[[File:Dennis Mortimer (1982).jpg|thumb|right|Aston Villa captain Dennis Mortimer lifted the European Cup in 1982.]]\nFollowing a 14th place finish in the Second Division, Crowe was replaced in August 1974 by [[Ron Saunders]]. He was a fitness fanatic, whose brand of no-nonsense man-management proved effective, with the club winning the League Cup the following season and, by the end of season 1974\u201375, he had taken Aston Villa back into the First Division and into Europe.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 111.</ref> One player who had been a mainstay of the Villa team throughout the rollercoaster of relegations and subsequent revival was fan-favourite [[Charlie Aitken (footballer, born 1942)|Charlie Aitkin]], who made 659 appearances at [[left back]] for the club between 1959 and 1976, making him Villa's all-time record appearance holder.\n\nAston Villa were back among the elite as Saunders continued to mould a winning team, finishing 4th in the league and winning a further League Cup in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]], with the formidable strike partnership of [[Brian Little]] and [[Andy Gray (footballer, born 1955)|Andy Gray]], who became the first player to win both the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] and [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] in the same season.\n\nThe 1970s was an era of boardroom unrest at Villa Park. Ron Saunders had a strained relationship with [[Doug Ellis]], who resented Doug's perceived interference in football matters. Over time Ellis became an isolated figure on the board, as the other directors sided with Saunders. He was ousted as chairman in 1975 to make way for [[Sir William Dugdale, 2nd Baronet|Sir William Dugdale]]. He remained on the board until 1979, when he left the club after a protracted power struggle with majority shareholder [[Ron Bendall]]. With Ellis gone, Saunders became all-powerful as manager.\n\nVilla achieved a seventh top-flight league title in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], with players such as [[Gordon Cowans]], [[Tony Morley]] and captain [[Dennis Mortimer]] leading the club to its first top-flight title in 71 years. Remarkably, they did so using just 14 players, with seven players being ever-presents. Villa's Birmingham-born forward [[Gary Shaw (footballer, born 1961)|Gary Shaw]] was named 1980-1981 [[PFA Young Player of the Year]]. \n\nTo the surprise of commentators and fans, Ron Saunders quit halfway through the [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]] season, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. Saunders had expressed his exasperation with the board at the lack of funds available to him to strengthen the team and fell out with the chairman Ron Bendall over the terms of his contract.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sydenham |first1=Richard |title=Ticket to the Moon |date=2018 |publisher=deCoubertin Books |isbn=978-1-909245-76-1 |page=155}}</ref> He was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager [[Tony Barton (footballer)|Tony Barton]] who guided the club to a 1\u20130 victory over [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the [[1982 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] in [[Rotterdam]] courtesy of a [[Peter Withe]] goal in the 67th minute. Ten minutes into the final, Villa's first choice goalkeeper, [[Jimmy Rimmer]], was injured and young substitute keeper [[Nigel Spink]] was called into action, having only made one previous appearance in the first team. Spink performed superbly, keeping a clean sheet, and helping Villa become only the fourth English club to lift the European Cup. \n[[File:82team.jpg|thumb|left|The 1982 European Cup winning squad celebrate the 25th anniversary of their win.|alt=In the foreground is two men holding a large cup, they have claret scarves and a medal around their necks.

This marked a pinnacle though and Villa's fortunes declined sharply for most of the 1980s. Doug Ellis returned as chairman and majority shareholder in November 1982. The club was saddled with significant debts and questions had been raised by the police regarding fraudulent financial activity surrounding the building of the North Stand at Villa Park from 1980-82. The cost of the work was \u00a31.3&nbsp;million. An internal investigation found that \u00a3700,000 of the \u00a31.3&nbsp;million worth of bills were unaccounted for.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}<!-- Empty reference ref name=Hayes172/--> A later report by accountants [[Deloitte]] found that there were \"serious breaches of recommended codes of practice and poor site supervision.\"<ref>Inglis, Simon (1997), p.188</ref> Ellis immediately set about trying to reduce the club's overheads.

Villa finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season under the charismatic manager [[Ron Atkinson]]. His side lifted the League Cup in 1994, beating Manchester United 3\u20131 in the final, with goals from [[Dalian Atkinson]] and [[Dean Saunders]], but the team struggled for form in the league and Atkinson was replaced by former Villa striker [[Brian Little]] in November 1994. Little assembled a young side which included players as [[Gareth Southgate]], [[Steve Staunton]], [[Ian Taylor (footballer, born 1968)|Ian Taylor]] and [[Dwight Yorke]], leading the club to a fifth League Cup triumph in 1996, beating [[Leeds United]] 3\u20130 at Wembley. Villa finished fourth in the league that season, and fifth the season after.\n\nFollowing a dip in form, Doug Ellis sacked Brian Little and replaced him with another former Villa player [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]] in February 1998. One of his first matches in charge was the [[Uefa Cup]] quarter-final against [[Athletico Madrid]], which Villa lost on away goals over two-legs. In the summer of 1998, Villa's star-player Dwight Yorke told Gregory he wanted to leave the club, to which Gregory was later attributed as saying that he \"would have shot Yorke if he had had a gun in his office\". He was transferred to Manchester United for \u00a312.6 million in August 1998. Gregory managed four top-eight finishes in the league and took the club to an FA Cup final in 2000 with a side that included [[David James (footballer, born 1970)|David James]], [[Dion Dublin]], [[Paul Merson]] and [[Gareth Barry]] but was unable to assemble a team capable of challenging for Champions League places.
