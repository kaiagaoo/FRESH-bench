The Galaxy competes in [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), as a member of the [[Western Conference (MLS)|Western Conference]]. The club began play in [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996]] as one of the league's 10 charter members.\n\nThe Galaxy were founded in 1994 and are owned by [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (also owners of 50% of the [[Los Angeles Kings]], as well as an interest in the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]). In their early years, the club played its home games at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. Since 2003, they have played at [[Dignity Health Sports Park]] in [[Carson, California]]. The team holds a rivalry with the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] in the [[California Cl\u00e1sico]] and used to play the [[SuperClasico]] against city rivals [[Chivas USA]] before that team folded in 2014. Following the league's dissolution of Chivas USA, a new expansion team, [[Los Angeles FC|Los Angeles Football Club]] (LAFC), was formed in 2014 and began play in 2018.  The new L.A. rivalry was dubbed \"[[El Tr\u00e1fico]].\"\n\nThe franchise is one of [[Major League Soccer records and statistics#All-time most successful teams|Major League Soccer's most successful teams]], with a record five [[MLS Cup]]s and four additional appearances in the final, and won the Western Conference regular-season title eight times, four [[Supporters' Shield]]s, two [[U.S. Open Cup]]s, and one [[CONCACAF Champions' Cup]] title. In 2017, the club added the dubious [[Wooden spoon (award)#Major League Soccer|MLS Wooden Spoon]] to its trophy case for finishing at the bottom of the MLS table.\n\nIn 2007, the club made international headlines with the signing of English player [[David Beckham]] from [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]], the most high-profile transaction with Major League Soccer to that point.

They lost in the semi-final to the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], 2\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nThe Galaxy again finished first in the Western Conference in 1999, with a final record of 20\u201312, with a win in the [[CONCACAF Champions' Cup]], but lost to D.C. United again 2\u20130. The 2000 season had the Galaxy in second in the Western Division, at 14\u201310\u20138. Despite this, they lost to the [[Kansas City Wizards]] after a tied aggregate and a sudden-death game. Los Angeles won the CONCACAF Champions' Cup that same year, one of two American clubs to win the tournament.\n\n2001 was another successful year for Los Angeles, winning the Open Cup and scoring 1,000 all-time points, and with [[Cobi Jones]] scoring the 300th goal, but again they fell short by being defeated by [[Landon Donovan]] and the [[San Jose Earthquakes]]. Again the club clinched first in the Western Conference with a 16\u20139\u20133 record, their fifth time being first.
