The Warriors compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]]. Founded in 1946 in [[Philadelphia]], the Warriors moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1962 and took the city's name, before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971.{{efn|name=geographic}}{{efn|name=golden}} The club plays its home games at the [[Chase Center]].\n\nThe Warriors won the inaugural [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA) championship in [[1947 BAA Finals|1947]],{{efn|name=inaugural}} and won again in [[1956 NBA Finals|1956]], led by [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] trio [[Paul Arizin]], [[Tom Gola]], and [[Neil Johnston]]. After the trade of star [[Wilt Chamberlain]] in January 1965, the team finished the [[1964\u201365 NBA season|1964\u201365 season]] with the NBA's worst record (17\u201363). Their rebuilding period was brief due in large part to the Warriors' drafting of [[Rick Barry]] four months after the trade. In [[1975 NBA Finals|1975]], star players Barry and [[Jamaal Wilkes]] powered the Warriors to their third championship, widely considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.\n\nThe team struggled in the 1980s, then became playoff regulars at the turn of the decade with stars [[Tim Hardaway]], [[Mitch Richmond]], and [[Chris Mullin]], nicknamed \"[[Run TMC]]\". Led by [[Stephen Curry]], [[Klay Thompson]], and [[Draymond Green]], the team returned to championship glory in [[2015 NBA Finals|2015]], with defensive swingman [[Andre Iguodala]] being named [[NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]]. In [[2015\u201316 Golden State Warriors season|2016]], the Warriors set the record for best regular season record at 73-9 before losing the [[2016 NBA Finals|Finals]] to the [[2015\u201316 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]] (against whom they played a record four straight finals) and becoming the first team to lose a series after leading 3\u20131 in the Finals. After signing former MVP [[Kevin Durant]], the team won back-to-back championships in [[2017 NBA Finals|2017]] and [[2018 NBA Finals|2018]] (Durant winning both Finals MVPs). They lost the [[2019 NBA Finals|2019 Finals]] to the [[2018\u201319 Toronto Raptors season|Toronto Raptors]], a series which saw Durant and Thompson suffer serious Achilles and ACL injuries, respectively; Durant left that off-season. After missing the playoffs the following two seasons, the Warriors returned to the playoffs with a healthy Thompson and a new supporting cast that included All-Star [[Andrew Wiggins]] and key scorer [[Jordan Poole]]; they defeated the Boston Celtics in the [[2022 NBA Finals|2022 Finals]], where Curry won his first Finals MVP. The Warriors' dynasty has seen the team win four titles in eight seasons, as well as reach five consecutive Finals from 2015 to 2019 (six Finals in eight years); Curry, Green, Thompson, and Iguodala were on all four 21st century championship teams, [[Shaun Livingston]] and [[Kevon Looney]] were on three each.\n\nNicknamed the \"Dubs\" as a shortening of \"W's\",<ref>{{cite web|title=NBA LockerVision - Golden State Warriors - City Edition - Story Guide|url=https://lockervision.nba.com/outfit/golden-state-warriors/city-edition|publisher=NBA Properties, Inc.|website=LockerVision.NBA.com|access-date=November 3, 2023|quote=Born in The City, the Warriors as much as the cable car have become a symbol of San Francisco.

Known as \"Wilt the Stilt\", he led the team in scoring six times, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the NBA style of play forever. On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior \"home\" game played on a [[Hershey Sports Arena|neutral court]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]], Chamberlain [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game|scored 100 points]] against the [[New York Knicks]], a single-game record the NBA ranks among its finest moments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chamberlain scores 100 in 1962 game versus Knicks|url=http://www.nba.com/history/features/moment-1962-wilt-100/index.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=March 2, 2013|access-date=May 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1962, [[Franklin Mieuli]] purchased the majority shares of the team and relocated the franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area, renaming them the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home games at the [[Cow Palace]] in [[Daly City, California|Daly City]] (the facility lies just south of the San Francisco city limits) from 1962 to 1964 and the [[San Francisco Civic Auditorium]] from 1964 to 1966, though occasionally playing home games in nearby cities such as Oakland and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. They also played frequently at The [[University of San Francisco]] gymnasium.\n\nPrior to the [[1963\u201364 NBA season]], the Warriors drafted big man [[Nate Thurmond]] to go along with Chamberlain. The Warriors won the Western Division crown that season, but lost the [[1964 NBA Finals]] to the [[Boston Celtics]], four games to one. In the 1964\u201365 season, the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] for [[Connie Dierking]], [[Lee Shaffer]], [[Paul Neumann (basketball)|Paul Neumann]] and $150,000 and won only 17 games.\n\n===1965\u20131978: Thurmond and Barry===\n[[File:Nate Thurmond 1969.jpeg|thumb|150px|left|[[Nate Thurmond]] averaged over 20 points per game during five different seasons and over 20 rebounds per game during two seasons while with the Warriors.]]\nIn 1965, they drafted [[Rick Barry]] in the first round who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the [[1967 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] in the [[1966\u201367 NBA season|1966\u201367 season]], losing (four games to two) to Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the [[Philadelphia 76ers|76ers]].\n\n[[File:Rick Barry \u2013 Warriors (1).jpeg|thumb|150px|right|[[Rick Barry]] (shown in 1976) was named the NBA Finals MVP in 1975.]]\nAngered by management's failure to pay him certain incentive bonuses he felt were due him, Barry sat out the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1967\u201368 season]] and signed with the [[Oakland Oaks (ABA)|Oakland Oaks]] of the rival [[American Basketball Association]] for the following year, but after four seasons in the ABA rejoined the Warriors in 1972. During Barry's absence, the Warriors were no longer title contenders, and the mantle of leadership fell to Thurmond, [[Jeff Mullins (basketball)|Jeff Mullins]] and [[Rudy LaRusso]]. They began scheduling more home games in Oakland with the opening of the [[Oakland Coliseum Arena]] in 1966 and the [[1970\u201371 NBA season|1970\u201371 season]] was the team's last as the San Francisco Warriors.\n\nThe franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the [[1971\u201372 NBA season|1971\u201372 season]], to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California.<ref name=\"Golden\" />{{efn|name=geographic}} Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City. Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971.\n\nThe Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first [[1975 NBA Finals|NBA championship]] on the West Coast in [[1974\u201375 NBA season|1974\u201375]]. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored [[Washington Bullets]] but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior [[Al Attles]], and led on the court by Rick Barry and [[Jamaal Wilkes]]. Barry was named Finals MVP.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rick Barry Bio|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/barry_bio.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=May 3, 2015|access-date=May 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt 59\u201323, the Warriors had the league's best record during the [[1975\u201376 NBA season|1975\u201376 season]]. They were upset, however, by the [[1975\u201376 Phoenix Suns season|42\u201340 Phoenix Suns]] in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\n===1978\u20131985: Competitive struggles===\nDue of the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward [[Purvis Short]] (1978), former [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]] center [[Joe Barry Carroll]] (1980) and center [[Robert Parish]] (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]] for the pick used to draft Carroll. In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent [[Bernard King]], but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard [[Micheal Ray Richardson]], whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard [[Sleepy Floyd|Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd]], and journeyman forward [[Mickey Johnson]]. Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe departure of these players for various reasons symbolized the franchise's futility during this period, as head coach Attles moved up to the front office as general manager in 1980 and the team made several coaching changes. New owners Jim Fitzgerald and Dan Finane finally managed to return the team to respectability by hiring former [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] head coach [[George Karl]] as head coach in 1986 after selecting [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] small forward [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]] in the [[1985 NBA draft]].\n\n===1985\u20131997: The \"Run TMC\" era===\nAfter a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against [[Magic Johnson]] and the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] that is still shown on TV in the ''NBA's Greatest Games'' series. The second-half performance by the Warriors' All-Star point guard [[Sleepy Floyd]] still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors.\n\nThe \"Sleepy Floyd game\" catalyzed increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area; so did new coach [[Don Nelson]], who engineered a string of wins in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the high-scoring trio of point guard [[Tim Hardaway]], guard [[Mitch Richmond]] and forward Chris Mullin. Collectively known as \"[[Run TMC]]\" after the rap group [[Run-D.M.C.]], the trio stayed together for just two seasons and won only one playoff series. Nelson sent Richmond to the [[Sacramento Kings]] for rookie power forward [[Billy Owens]], a promising young front-court player meant to complement the coach's [[Nellie Ball|run-and-gun system]]. Nelson had been brought to the Warriors from the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] by [[Jim Fitzgerald (businessman)|Jim Fitzgerald]], who co-owned the team from [[1986\u201387 NBA season|1986]] to [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1995]] with Dan Finnane. In [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]], with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year power forward [[Chris Webber]] playing with off-guard [[Latrell Sprewell]], the Warriors made the playoffs.\n\nAt the start of the next season, however, a rift formed between Webber and Sprewell on the one hand and Nelson on the other. All three soon left the team, and the organization went into a tailspin. The [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]] was the first under new team owner [[Chris Cohan]], who had bought out Fitzgerald and Finnane. The Warriors selected power forward prospect [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]] as their first overall draft pick in [[1995 NBA draft|1995]] and hired [[Rick Adelman]] as the new head coach. They sent Tim Hardaway and [[Chris Gatling]] to the [[Miami Heat]] for [[Kevin Willis]] and [[Bimbo Coles]] midway through the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]], and ended up with a 36\u201346 record, three wins short of making the playoffs. While their home court, the Oakland Coliseum Arena, was being extensively renovated, the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397]] Warriors played their home games in the [[San Jose Arena]] and struggled to a 30\u201352 finish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Golden State Warriors 2014\u201315 Media Guide|url=http://mediacentral.nba.com/media/mediacentral/2014-15-Warriors-MediaGuide.pdf#page=223|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=October 10, 2014|access-date=May 3, 2015}}</ref> Following the season, Mullin was traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] in exchange for [[Erick Dampier]] and [[Duane Ferrell]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Warriors Trade Mullin to Pacers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/12/sports/warriors-trade-mullin-to-pacers.html |work=The New York Times |date=August 12, 1997 |access-date=July 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132009: Wilderness years and \"We believe\" mindset===\nLongtime Seton Hall college coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]], who had been recently fired by the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], replaced Adelman as head coach for the [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]]. Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline \"WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM\" and the declaration by general manager [[Garry St. Jean]] that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again. He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for [[John Starks (basketball)|John Starks]], [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]] and [[Terry Cummings]].\n\nSt. Jean had become the new Warriors' general manager in July 1997; he and his predecessor [[Dave Twardzik]] received much of the blame for the Warriors' struggles early in Cohan's turbulent tenure as owner in addition to Cohan himself.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Mark |last=Fainaru-Wada |title=The man who owns the Warriors / Cohan's rocky reign / An era marked by lost games, lost fans and endless litigation |url=https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/SPECIAL-REPORT-The-man-who-owns-the-Warriors-2874504.php |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 10, 2002|access-date=May 16, 2022}}</ref> St. Jean brought in players such as Terry Cummings, John Starks and [[Mookie Blaylock]] who were well past their primes. Twardzik drafted several flops, such as [[Todd Fuller]] (while [[Kobe Bryant]] was still available as well as [[Steve Nash]] and [[Jermaine O'Neal]]) and [[Steve Logan]] (who never played an NBA game). In the following draft, the team selected [[Adonal Foyle]] while [[Tracy McGrady]] was still available. St. Jean did, however, draft future two-time NBA [[slam dunk]] champion off-guard [[Jason Richardson]] (from [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]]), a Warriors' star scorer through the 2006\u201307 season.\n\nFor a few years, with rising stars Richardson, small forward [[Antawn Jamison]] and point guard [[Gilbert Arenas]] leading the team, the Warriors seemed like a team on the rise; but the young Warriors did not have enough in the competitive Western Conference to make the playoffs. After the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]], St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like [[Danny Fortson]], [[Adonal Foyle]] and [[Erick Dampier]] were painfully felt by Warriors' fans when the team was unable to re-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Golden State Warriors.svg|thumb|200px|Warriors logo 1997\u20132010{{ffdc|Golden State Warriors.svg|log=2016 August 15|date=September 2016}}]] -->\n\nIn June 2003, Cohan elevated marketing executive [[Robert Rowell (basketball)|Robert Rowell]] to team president, a role which involved hiring, firing and contract negotiation on the basketball side.<ref name=\"2003promotion\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/rowell_president_060903.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221103201809/https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/rowell_president_060903.html |archive-date=November 3, 2022 |title=Warriors Promote Robert Rowell To Team President |last=Spencer |first=K |date=June 9, 2003 |website=NBA.com |access-date=January 3, 2023}}</ref> After a disappointing [[2003\u201304 Golden State Warriors season|2003-04 season]], head coach [[Eric Musselman]] and St. Jean were fired. [[Mike Montgomery]] was hired as head coach and Chris Mullin was chosen to succeed St. Jean with the title of executive vice president of basketball operations. Mullin hoped to build a winning team around Jason Richardson, [[Mike Dunleavy Jr]] and [[Troy Murphy]], and drafted 7-foot center [[Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161]] from Latvia (11th overall). At the 2005 trading deadline, he bolstered to the team with the acquisition of point guard [[Baron Davis]], bringing to the team its first superstar since Mullin himself.\n\nThe Warriors enjoyed a great start to the [[2005\u201306 Golden State Warriors season|2005\u201306 season]], entering the new year with a plus .500 winning percentage for the first time since 1994, but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries. Davis often found himself at odds with new head coach Mike Montgomery (used to dealing with college players in his long tenure at Stanford) and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, 2006, the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention in a 114\u2013109 overtime loss to the [[New Orleans Hornets|Hornets]], extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons.\n\nEntering the [[2006\u201307 Golden State Warriors season|2006\u201307 season]], the Warriors held the active record (12) for the most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance (see [[Active NBA non-playoff appearance streaks]]). During the 2006 off-season, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of coach Montgomery's contract and hired previous Golden State and former [[Dallas Mavericks]] coach [[Don Nelson]] to take over for him. During training camp, small forward [[Matt Barnes]] established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, the Warriors traded the disappointing Murphy and Dunleavy with promising young power forward [[Ike Diogu]] and [[Keith McLeod]] to the Indiana Pacers for forward [[Al Harrington]], forward/guard [[Stephen Jackson]], guard [[\u0160ar\u016bnas Jasikevi\u010dius]] and forward [[Josh Powell]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pacers make 8-player trade with Warriors|url=http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/trade_070117.html|publisher=Indiana Pacers|date=January 17, 2007|access-date=May 3, 2015}}</ref> This trade allowed the Warriors to \"run and gun\" their way to the playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. On March 4, 2007, the Warriors suffered a 106\u2013107 loss in Washington, the Wizards handing them their 6th straight loss when former Warrior Arenas hit a technical free throw with less than one second remaining after Nelson had protested a controversial call with the Warriors ahead by a slim margin. The loss dropped them to 26\u201335.\n\nMarch 4 marked the turning point for the Warriors. The Warriors closed out the regular season (42\u201340) at 16\u20135 in their last 21 games.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/games/20070418/GSWPOR/boxscore.html Warriors@ Trail Blazers Recap] On April 18, the Warriors clinched their first playoff berth since 1994 with a resounding 120\u201398 win in the regular-season finale at [[Portland Trail Blazers|Portland]].</ref> \"We believe\" became the Warriors' slogan for the last two months of the season and the playoffs.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Marcus II |last=Thompson |title=Warriors fan is behind 'We Believe' campaign |url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/04/27/warriors-fan-is-behind-we-believe-campaign/ |work=[[East Bay Times]] |date=April 27, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717183123/http://www.contracostatimes.com/warriors/ci_5764491 |archive-date=July 17, 2007|access-date=May 16, 2022}}</ref>\n\nLed by a healthy Baron Davis, an ever-improving Jason Richardson and young future star off-guard [[Monta Ellis]] as well as center Biedri\u0146\u0161, the Warriors immediately dashed the highly favored top-seed Dallas Mavericks' expectations of a short and easy series win with a Game 1 victory in Dallas thanks to Davis' frantic style of play. The Mavericks came back to win Game 2 easily to tie the series at a game apiece, but the Warriors won both Games 3 and 4 with a huge lift from the home crowd at Oracle Arena. A close Game 5 saw the Mavericks eke out a 118\u2013112 victory with a last-minute surge led by superstar forward [[Dirk Nowitzki]] to send the series back to California at 3\u20132. In Game 6, the Warriors engineered a third-quarter 18\u20130 run to eliminate the Mavericks and become the NBA's first No.&nbsp;8 seed to beat a No.&nbsp;1 seed in a seven-game series (and the first NBA No.&nbsp;8 seed to beat the top seed since 1999 when the New York Knicks eliminated the Miami Heat). It was an upset in name only, given the fact that the Warriors had swept the Mavericks in the regular-season series.\n\nThe Warriors went on to play the [[Utah Jazz]] in the second round of the 2006\u201307 playoffs, where they dropped two close games at [[EnergySolutions Arena]] to open the series. The series then shifted to the Oracle Arena, where the Warriors won Game 3 in a convincing fashion. Davis scored 32 points and electrified the crowd with a monster dunk on Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko late in the fourth quarter, but they lost Game 4 at home, their first loss in Oakland in well over a month and the Jazz closed them out in Game 5 in [[Salt Lake City]].\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, the Warriors faced early difficulties in their attempt to return to the playoffs. Richardson was traded to the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] for rookie [[Brandan Wright]]. To make things even worse, Jackson was suspended for seven games over a firearm incident. They opened the season with six straight losses, but Ellis' rise, Davis' solid injury-free season (21.6 points, 8 assists, 4.6 rebounds per game),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/194/baron-davis |title=Baron Davis|work=ESPN|access-date=June 16, 2011}}</ref> and an overall improvement in team chemistry brought them back to playoff contention; but in the end the Warriors failed to make the playoffs despite a 48\u201334 record, which is the best record in NBA history for a non-playoff team since the NBA playoffs had expanded to eight teams per conference. The Western Conference was very strong that season; every playoff team won 50 games, leaving the Warriors two games out of the last playoff spot. The Warriors sold out nearly every home game during the season averaging 19,631 per game, the highest in team history.\n\nIn the 2008 off-season, Baron Davis opted to return to his hometown and sign with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. With the 14th pick of that year's [[2008 NBA draft|draft]], the Warriors selected and signed [[Anthony Randolph]] out of LSU. To compensate for the loss of Davis, the Warriors signed free agents [[Corey Maggette]] and [[Ronny Turiaf]] and re-signed Ellis and Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161 to long-term contracts.\n\nThe Warriors had a disappointing [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309 season]], finishing 29\u201353. Ellis was injured in a moped accident, and suspended for 30 games for riding the vehicle against the terms of his contract, depriving the Warriors of their top player. They traded disenchanted forward [[Al Harrington]] to the New York Knicks for guard [[Jamal Crawford]], and were undone by injuries and the minimal experience of their young players such as [[Anthony Morrow]] and Brandan Wright. Coach Nelson often had to make adjustments to the starting lineups since many of the original starters missed games due to injuries. Despite the team's losing record, the Warriors were hard to beat when they had a healthy lineup and a strong bench. With leadership and improvement in their young players, they were sometimes able to defeat powerhouse teams such as the Boston Celtics, 99\u201389.\n\n===2009\u2013present: The Stephen Curry era===\n\n====2009\u20132012: Continued struggles and suitable draft picks====\nThe Warriors chose future superstar point guard [[Stephen Curry]] of [[Davidson College]] as the seventh overall pick in the [[2009 NBA draft]].<ref name=Reference>{{cite web|title=Stephen Curry NBA Stats|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html|publisher=Basketball Reference|access-date=January 2, 2016}}</ref> During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Chris Mullin.

In November, a malcontented Stephen Jackson and seldom-used [[Acie Law]] were traded to the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] for [[Raja Bell]] (out for the season with an injury) and [[Vladimir Radmanovic]]. Four days later, they signed center [[Chris Hunter (basketball)|Chris Hunter]]. Starting in January 2010, they issued multiple 10-day contracts, most notably to power forward [[Anthony Tolliver]] from the [[Idaho Stampede]]. Due to their multiple injuries, they were granted an exception allowing them to sign [[Reggie Williams (basketball, born 1986)|Reggie Williams]] from the [[Sioux Falls Skyforce]] to a 10-day contract on March 2. They eventually waived the injured Bell to sign Williams for the rest of the year and finished the season 26\u201356, failing to make the playoffs.

They also introduced a modernized version of their \"The City\" logo depicting the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco&nbsp;\u2013 Oakland Bay Bridge|new eastern span]] of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]], and switched to a simplified color scheme of royal blue and gold. They also introduced new uniforms reminiscent of the 1969\u201371 \"The City\" uniforms. The Warriors made an off-season trade that sent Turiaf, Randolph and [[Kelenna Azubuike]] to the New York Knicks in return for star high-scoring power forward [[David Lee (basketball)|David Lee]] via a sign-and-trade. Lee agreed to a six-year, $80&nbsp;million deal, on a framework contingent on [[The Decision (TV special)|the decision]] of superstar forward [[LeBron James]] to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat that same day.

In early December their record was 12\u20139, as compared to 17\u20134 the year before. One challenging factor was a tough starting schedule that saw them play 14 of their first 22 games on the road, including 10 games against teams holding playoff spots in the standings. A stream of injuries also held the team back, including injuries to Ezeli, Douglas, and O'Neal. Most prominently of all, Iguodala suffered a hamstring pull in late November that kept him out for over a month; during this period, the Warriors' performance suffered significantly on both the defensive and offensive ends of the court and the team posted a losing 5\u20137 record while revealing a lack of bench depth. With Iguodala back in the lineup, the Warriors went on a 10-game winning streak that included six consecutive wins on a single road trip, tying an NBA record. The winning streak was the longest for the franchise since the 1975 championship year, and fell just one win short of the team record of 11 consecutive wins.\n\nTo strengthen their underperforming bench, the Warriors made a three-team trade on January 15, sending Douglas to the Miami Heat and picking up guards [[Jordan Crawford]] and [[MarShon Brooks]] from the Boston Celtics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/boston/nba/story/_/id/10297979/boston-celtics-trade-jordan-crawford-marshon-brooks-golden-state-warriors|title=Boston Celtics trade Jordan Crawford, MarShon Brooks to Golden State Warriors|work=ESPN|date=January 15, 2014|access-date=May 16, 2022}}</ref> A day before the trade deadline, the Warriors traded [[Kent Bazemore]] and Brooks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for veteran point guard [[Steve Blake]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/warriors/2014/02/19/warriors-acquire-steve-blake-from-lakers/ | title=Warriors acquire Steve Blake from Lakers | date=February 19, 2014 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | access-date=April 15, 2015}}</ref> Boosted by the additions of Blake and Crawford and the play of 35-year-old Jermaine O'Neal (who returned sooner than expected from wrist surgery), the Warriors were one of the winningest teams in the NBA after the All-Star break. On April 11, in a 112\u201395 stomping of the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, the Warriors clinched a playoff berth in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. However, just one day earlier in a loss against the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], [[Andrew Bogut]] suffered a cracked rib kept him out of the postseason; the injury dealt a blow to the sixth-seed Warriors' playoff hopes.\n\nEven as the team rolled towards the postseason, signs emerged of trouble in the Warriors' front office.

Even without Bogut, the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game in the first round of the playoffs before their 2013\u201314 season came to an end. It was a season of many thrilling moments; the Warriors played in 17 regular-season games decided by two points or less, six games decided by winning shots in the final three seconds, and seven comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more.<ref>{{cite web|title=2013\u201314 Top Games: Part 1|url=http://www.nba.com/warriors/blogs/top-games-1314-1|website=National Basketball Association|publisher=Golden State Warriors|date=May 3, 2015|access-date=May 3, 2015}}</ref> Curry also made his first appearance in the [[2014 NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in 2014.
