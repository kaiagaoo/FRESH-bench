After losses to [[1970 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]] and [[1970 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles]], the 49ers won their next two games before the season finale against the [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]. Going into the game, the 49ers had a half-game lead on the Rams and needed either a win or a [[1970 New York Giants season|Giants]] victory against the Rams in their finale to give the 49ers their first-ever divisional title.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the early game, the Giants lost to the Rams 31\u20133, thus forcing the 49ers to win their game to clinch the division. In wet, rainy conditions in Oakland, the 49ers won against the Raiders, 38\u20137, giving the 49ers their first divisional title, which made them champions of the NFC West. The 49ers won their divisional playoff game 17\u201314 against the defending conference champion [[1970 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], thus setting up a matchup against the [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] for the NFC Championship. In the final home game for the 49ers at [[Kezar Stadium]], the 49ers kept up with the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] before losing 17\u201310, which resulted in the Cowboys going to [[Super Bowl V]]. The 49ers sent five players to the [[1970 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] that season, including MVP veteran quarterback [[John Brodie]], wide receiver [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]], and linebacker [[Dave Wilcox]]. Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season, the 49ers moved from [[Kezar Stadium]] to [[Candlestick Park]]. Despite being located on the outskirts of the city, Candlestick Park gave the 49ers a much more modern facility with more amenities that was easier for fans to access by highway.<ref>Parkhouse, B.

The 49ers again won their divisional playoff game, this time against the [[1971 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]], by 24\u201320. This set up a rematch against the [[1971 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the NFC Championship game, this time played in Dallas. Though the defense again held the Cowboys in check, the 49ers offense was ineffective, and the eventual Super Bowl champion Cowboys beat the 49ers again, 14\u20133. In 1971, eight 49ers made the [[1972 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]], including defensive back [[Jimmy Johnson (cornerback)|Jimmy Johnson]] and [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]], both for the second year in a row, as well as defensive end [[Cedric Hardman]], running back [[Vic Washington]], and offensive lineman [[Forrest Blue]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1971/probowl.htm|title=1971 NFL Pro Bowlers {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201154551/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1971/probowl.htm|archive-date=February 1, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe 49ers won their third consecutive NFC West title in [[1972 NFL season|1972]] with five wins in their last six games, making them the only franchise to win their first three divisional titles after the 1970 [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]]. Their opponents in the divisional playoffs were the [[1972 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], making it the third consecutive year the teams faced each other in the playoffs. Vic Washington took the opening kickoff 97 yards for a score, and the 49ers took a 21\u20136 lead in the second quarter. After the 49ers took a 28\u201313 lead in the fourth quarter, Tom Landry sent quarterback [[Roger Staubach]], who was backing up [[Craig Morton]], into the game. Staubach quickly led the Cowboys on a drive to a field goal, bringing the score to within 28\u201316, and as the game wound down it appeared that this would be the last points the Cowboys would get. However, Dallas completed the comeback in the last two minutes. Just after the two-minute warning, Staubach took just four plays to drive 55 yards in only 32 seconds, hitting [[Billy Parks]] on a twenty-yard touchdown pass to bring the score to 28\u201323. Cowboys kicker [[Toni Fritsch]] then executed a successful onside kick that was recovered by [[Mel Renfro]], giving the Cowboys the ball at midfield with 1:20 left on the clock. With the 49ers on the ropes, Staubach scrambled for 21 yards, then completed a 19-yard sideline pass to [[Billy Parks]] who went out of bounds at the 10-yard line to stop the clock. Staubach then completed the comeback with a 10-yard touchdown pass to [[Ron Sellers]] with only 52 seconds left, giving the Cowboys a dramatic 30\u201328 victory; it was the third straight season the Cowboys had defeated the 49ers in the postseason. It would also be their last postseason appearance for [[1981 San Francisco 49ers season|nine years]].\n\nThe 49ers run at the top of the NFC West ended in [[1973 NFL season|1973]] with the 49ers falling to a 5\u20139 record, their worst since 1969. The team lost six of its last eight games, including games to the also-ran [[1973 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and [[1973 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. In the final season of his career, longtime 49ers quarterback [[John Brodie]] split playing time with two other quarterbacks, most notably longtime backup [[Steve Spurrier]]. The team also suffered from not having a dominant running back, with [[Vic Washington]] leading the team with only 534 yards rushing.\n\nIn [[1974 NFL season|1974]], the 49ers drafted [[Wilbur Jackson]] from the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] to be the team's primary back. Jackson enjoyed a fine rookie year, leading the 49ers with 705 yards rushing. He and fellow running back [[Larry Schreiber]] combined for over 1,300 yards rushing. With [[Steve Spurrier]] injured and missing nearly the entire year, the 49ers did not have a regular quarterback but did put together a respectable 6\u20138 record. Following the season, longtime tight end [[Ted Kwalick]] left the 49ers to join the [[World Football League]], then the Oakland Raiders upon the WFL's dissolution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 49ers dropped to 5\u20139 in what would be Dick Nolan's final season as coach in [[1975 NFL season|1975]], losing their final four games of the season. Wilbur Jackson was hurt much of the year and [[Delvin Williams]] led the 49ers in rushing with 631 yards rushing. Following the 1975 season the 49ers traded for [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]], former Heisman Trophy winner from nearby [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]] (which was also the alma mater of John Brodie). Though Plunkett had shown promise with the Patriots, he had not won there, and it was thought that he needed a change of scenery. [[Monte Clark]] was also brought on as 49ers head coach.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 49ers featured one of the best running games in the NFL in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1,200 yards rushing and made the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Once again Gene Washington was the team's leading receiver with 457 yards receiving and six scores. The 49ers started the season 6\u20131 for their best start since 1970. Most of the wins were against second-tier teams, although the 49ers did shut out the Rams 16\u20130, in [[1976 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles]] on ''[[Monday Night Football]]''. In that game the 49ers recorded 10 sacks, including 6 by [[Tommy Hart]]. However, the 49ers lost four games in a row, including two against divisional rivals Los Angeles and [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] that proved fatal to their playoff hopes.\n\n=== Edward DeBartolo era (1977\u20131999) ===\nLou Spadia retired from the 49ers in 1977 upon the team's sale to the DeBartolo Family. The team was sold to [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.]] in March 1977, and despite finishing the season with a winning record of 8\u20136, Clark was fired after just one season by newly hired general manager [[Joe Thomas (American football executive)|Joe Thomas]], who oversaw the worst stretch of football in the team's history.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUnder coach [[Ken Meyer]] the 49ers lost their first five games of the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]], including being shut out twice.<ref name=\"u237\">{{cite web | title=Longtime coach, Gadsden resident Meyer dies at 91 | website=Gadsden Times | date=2016-08-16 | url=https://www.gadsdentimes.com/story/sports/college/2016/08/16/longtime-coach-gadsden-resident-meyer-dies-at-91/25626696007/ | access-date=2024-08-30}}</ref> Though they won five of their next six, they lost their last three games to finish the season 5\u20139. Playing in San Francisco did not revive Plunkett's career as he had another disappointing season, throwing only 9 touchdown passes. Bright spots for the 49ers included defensive linemen [[Tommy Hart]] and [[Cleveland Elam]], who made the Pro Bowl, and running backs [[Wilbur Jackson]] and [[Delvin Williams]], who combined for over 1,600 yards rushing. [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]] again led the team in receiving in 1977, his final year with the 49ers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1977 San Francisco 49ers Rosters, Stats, Schedule, Team Draftees |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1977.htm |access-date=2024-08-30 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref> The 1977 offseason was marked by a number of questionable moves by Joe Thomas that backfired badly. Thomas's big offseason acquisition was running back [[O. J. Simpson]] from the [[Buffalo Bills]]. As with Plunkett two years previously, it was thought that rescuing Simpson from a bad situation and bringing him to the west coast where he had been raised would rejuvenate his career. To create playing time for Simpson, Thomas traded Delvin Williams to the [[Miami Dolphins]] for wide receiver [[Freddie Solomon]]. Thomas also released Jim Plunkett, giving up on him after two seasons. Finally, Thomas fired Meyer after only one season, and replaced him with [[Pete McCulley]], his third coach in three seasons.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1978/01/11/49ers-name-mcculley-coach/a0055e90-2f4a-4634-a175-d54c5eba7020/?noredirect=on|title=49ers Name McCulley Coach|newspaper=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=May 20, 2019|archive-date=May 6, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210506062508/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1978/01/11/49ers-name-mcculley-coach/a0055e90-2f4a-4634-a175-d54c5eba7020/?noredirect=on|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1978 NFL season|1978 season]] was a disaster for the 49ers, as they finished 2\u201314, their only wins coming against the [[1978 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[1978 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Simpson indeed led the team in rushing, but with less than 600 yards.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1978 San Francisco 49ers Rosters, Stats, Schedule, Team Draftees |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1978.htm |access-date=2024-08-30 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref> It became apparent that Simpson's knees and body were worn out, and he was near the end of his career. Wilbur Jackson also missed the entire season due to injury. Even worse for the franchise was that their first pick of the [[1979 NFL season|1979 draft]] was traded to the Bills as part of the O. J. Simpson deal. Joe Thomas was fired following the season. Some of the key players that became part of the 49ers stunning rise began their 49ers career in 1978. Rookie quarterback [[Steve DeBerg]], [[Joe Montana]]'s first mentor, was the 49ers' starting quarterback. Running back [[Paul Hofer]] and center/guard [[Randy Cross]] also started with the 49ers in 1978.[[File:DeBartolo headquarters.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of [[The DeBartolo Corporation]] in [[Boardman, Ohio]], with the 49ers logo on the building, signifying the team's ownership by the [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]-based DeBartolo-York family]]\n\nThe team was led in its turnaround from late 1970s doormat by new owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.]] and head coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. The former head coach of [[Stanford University]] was known for stockpiling draft picks, making excellent draft selections, and patching roster holes by acquiring key free agents.\n\n==== Bill Walsh years (1979\u20131988) ====\nBill Walsh was hired to be the 49ers head coach in the 1978 off-season.<ref name=\"d156\">{{cite web | title=Bill Walsh Is Named 49er Coach | website=The New York Times | date=1979-01-10 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/10/archives/bill-walsh-is-named-49er-coach.html | access-date=2024-08-30}}</ref> Walsh was a disciple of [[Paul Brown]], and served as Brown's offensive coordinator with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] from 1968 to 1975. However, Brown did not appoint him as his successor upon his retirement, choosing another assistant, former 49ers center [[Bill Johnson (center)|Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson]]. Walsh was hired by [[Stanford University]] in 1977. He went 17\u20137 in two seasons for the Cardinal before being hired by the 49ers in 1979.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bill Walsh College Coaching Records, Awards and Leaderboards |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/bill-walsh-1.html |access-date=2024-08-30 |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWalsh is given credit for popularizing the '[[West Coast offense]]'. The Bill Walsh offense was actually created and refined while he was an assistant coach with the Bengals. The offense utilizes a short, precise, timed passing game as a replacement/augmentation of the running game. The offense is extremely difficult to defend against as it is content to consistently make 6\u20138-yard gains all the way down the field. (The other West Coast offense\u2014more focused on the vertical, or downfield, passing game\u2014was actually created by 1960s L.A. / San Diego coach [[Sid Gillman]], and San Diego State coach [[Don Coryell]], who also employed a version of it as head coach of the St. Louis (football) Cardinals and [[San Diego Chargers]] during a period where it garnered the nickname \"[[Coryell Offense|Air Coryell]]\".)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theathleteshub.org/breaking-down-the-air-coryell-offense/|title=Breaking Down The Air Coryell Offense|date=November 18, 2019|website=The Athletes Hub|access-date=November 19, 2021|archive-date=November 19, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211119032153/https://theathleteshub.org/breaking-down-the-air-coryell-offense/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn Walsh's first draft, the 49ers had targeted [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] quarterback [[Joe Montana]] as an early-round pick. Montana had enjoyed a storied college career, leading the [[1977 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Fighting Irish]] to the 1977 national title and a number of dramatic comeback victories, the most stunning of all being his final game, at the [[1979 Cotton Bowl Classic]]. Playing the [[Houston Cougars football|University of Houston]] in an ice storm, and with Montana suffering from a bad flu, Notre Dame was down 34\u201310 in the third quarter. However, Montana led a magnificent rally that culminated with him throwing a touchdown pass on the game's final play to give Notre Dame the 35\u201334 win.\n[[File:Joe Montana ESPN cropped2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joe Montana]] in 2006]]\nDespite this, most scouts did not peg Montana as a top prospect. Although 6'2\" and 190\u2013200&nbsp;lbs., Montana's arm strength was considered suspect as was the consistency of his play. Although he did get his share of the credit, most thought of him as a system player surrounded by a great team.\n\nIn the 1979 draft, the Dallas Cowboys were placed just ahead of the 49ers. The Cowboys' draft strategy through that time was to take the highest-ranked player on their draft board at the time of their selection, regardless of position. When the Cowboys' turn came up in the third round, the highest-rated player on their board was Montana. However, feeling that the quarterback position was in excellent long-term shape with [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Danny White]], and desperately needing a tight end, the Cowboys went off their strategy and drafted [[Doug Cosbie]]. The 49ers took Montana. The 49ers' other notable draft choice of the 1979 draft was wide receiver [[Dwight Clark]] in the 10th round. Walsh discovered the unheralded Clark while scouting quarterback Steve Fuller of [[Clemson University]] as Clark ran routes for Fuller during Walsh's evaluation of the quarterback. Walsh's serendipitous discovery of Clark proved to be an early glimpse into his philosophy for picking talent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfl.com/news/bill-walsh-s-nfl-draft-philosophies-six-lessons-from-the-master-09000d5d82857c66|title=Bill Walsh's NFL draft philosophies: Six lessons from the master|website=NFL.com|access-date=November 19, 2021|archive-date=November 19, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211119032152/https://www.nfl.com/news/bill-walsh-s-nfl-draft-philosophies-six-lessons-from-the-master-09000d5d82857c66|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs Walsh implemented his strategies and game plan, the 49ers had another year of losing, finishing 2\u201314 like the previous season. There were, however, a number of bright spots. Despite throwing more interceptions (21) than touchdowns (17), [[Steve DeBerg]] blossomed under Walsh, throwing for over 3,600 yards and completing 60% of his passes. Freddie Solomon also had a good year, with over 800 yards receiving. The running game was patchwork, with Paul Hofer leading the team with 615 yards and [[O. J. Simpson]], in his final season, rushing for only 460 yards and being sidelined with injuries. The 49ers got off to a strong start in 1980, winning their first three games of the season. However, the team, still maturing, lost their next eight games in a row. Many of those games though were close, and the 49ers acquitted themselves well. During the season Walsh alternated DeBerg and Montana at quarterback. Though DeBerg had played well for the 49ers, Walsh felt the team's best chance to win in the long run was with Montana. He alternated the two quarterbacks, giving Montana some experience while keeping opponents off guard. This strategy of alternating quarterbacks from game to game and during games is rare in football, although it had been employed by other successful teams in the past, specifically the [[Dallas Cowboys]] of the early 1970s who alternated [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Craig Morton]], and the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the late 1940s alternating [[Norm Van Brocklin]] and [[Bob Waterfield]].\n\nIn all DeBerg started nine games, going 4\u20135 with 1,998 yards, 12 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Montana started seven games, going 2\u20135 with 1,795 yards, 15 touchdowns, and nine picks; Montana also had a better completion percentage at 64.5 to DeBerg's 57.9.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1980.htm|title=1980 San Francisco 49ers Statistics & Players {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418093129/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1980.htm|archive-date=April 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe highlight of the 1980 season, and a sign of good things to come, came in Week 14. The 49ers trailed the [[New Orleans Saints]], who at the time were winless at 0\u201313, 35\u20137 at halftime. However, led by [[Joe Montana]], the 49ers made (what was then) possibly the greatest comeback in NFL history, coming back to tie the score in regulation and winning the game in [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] with a field goal by [[Ray Wersching]] to give the 49ers an incredible 38\u201335 victory. It was this game, which marked Montana's first big NFL comeback win, that won Montana the quarterback job full-time. A number of key players emerged for the 49ers in 1980. Among them were [[Dwight Clark]], who led the 49ers with 82 receptions and just under 1,000 yards receiving, and running back [[Earl Cooper (NFL)|Earl Cooper]], who ran for over 700 yards.\n\n===== Super Bowl XVI champions (1981) =====\n{{See also|1981 San Francisco 49ers season|The Catch (American football)}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 27 - Dan Bunz (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Head coach Bill Walsh led the 49ers to their first NFL championship, defeating the Bengals 26\u201321 in [[Super Bowl XVI]].]]\nWith the offense playing well consistently, Walsh and the 49ers focused on overhauling the defense in 1981. Walsh took the highly unusual step of overhauling his entire secondary with rookies and untested players, bringing on board [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Eric C. Wright|Eric Wright]] and [[Carlton Williamson]] and giving [[Dwight Hicks]] a prominent role. He also acquired veteran linebacker [[Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds]] and veteran defensive end and sack specialist [[Fred Dean]]. These additions, when added to existing defensive mainstays like [[Keena Turner]], turned the 49ers into an offensively and defensively balanced, dominant team. After a 1\u20132 start, the 49ers won all but one of their remaining games to finish with a 13\u20133 record; at this time, it was the team's best regular-season win\u2013loss record. Dean made the [[Pro Bowl]], as did Lott and Hicks. Led by Montana, the unusual offense was centered on the [[west coast offense|short passing game]], which Walsh used as ball control. Dwight Clark and [[Freddie Solomon]] had excellent years receiving; Clark as the possession receiver, and Solomon as more of a deep threat. The 49ers' running game, however, was among the weakest in the league. [[Ricky Patton]] led the 49ers with only 543 yards rushing. The 49ers' most valuable running back, however, might have been Earl Cooper, whose strength was as a pass catching back. The 49ers faced the [[New York Giants]] in the divisional playoffs and won, 38\u201324. This set up an NFC championship game match-up with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], whom the 49ers historically could not beat during their playoff runs in the early 1970s. The 49ers played the Cowboys tough, but the Cowboys forced six turnovers and held the lead late. The 49ers were down 27\u201321 and on their own 11-yard line with 4:54 remaining. As Montana had done for Notre Dame and the 49ers so many times, he led the 49ers on a sustained final 89-yard drive to the Cowboys' 6-yard line. On a 3rd-and-3 play, with his primary receiver covered, Montana rolled right and threw the ball off balance to Dwight Clark, who leaped in the end zone and caught the ball to tie the game at 27 (\"[[The Catch (NFL)|The Catch]]\"), with the extra point giving the 49ers the lead. The Cowboys had one last chance to win. On the first play of the next possession, Cowboys receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] caught a pass from Danny White and reached midfield before he was pulled down by the jersey at the 49ers' 44-yard line by cornerback Eric Wright, who prevented a winning touchdown. On the next play, White was sacked by [[Lawrence Pillers]] and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by [[Jim Stuckey]], giving the 49ers the win and a trip to their first-ever Super Bowl, against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], who were also in their first Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XVI]] The 49ers took a 20\u20130 halftime lead and held on to win 26\u201321 behind kicker [[Ray Wersching]]'s four field goals and a key defensive stand. In the '81 season, the defense had been a significant reason for the team's success, despite hiding in the shadow of the then-innovative offense. Montana won MVP honors mostly on the strength of leading the 49ers on a 92-yard, 12-play drive culminating in a touchdown pass to Earl Cooper.

Their 18 wins overall is also still a record, tied by the 1985 Bears and the 2007 New England Patriots (who won 18 straight, but lost [[Super Bowl XLII]] to the [[New York Giants]]). The 49ers' only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20\u201317 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker [[Ray Wersching]] went off the uprights and was no good. In the playoffs, they beat the [[New York Giants]] 21\u201310, shut out the [[Chicago Bears]] 23\u20130 in the NFC championship, and in [[Super Bowl XIX]] the 49ers shut down a record-setting year by NFL MVP [[Dan Marino]] (and his speedy receivers Mark Clayton and Mark Duper), beating the [[Miami Dolphins]] 38\u201316. Their entire defensive backfield (Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Dwight Hicks, and Carlton Williamson) was elected to the Pro Bowl\u2014an NFL first.\n\nIn the [[1985 NFL draft]], the team received the 28th overall pick after winning the Super Bowl the previous year. On draft day, the 49ers traded its first two picks for New England's first-round choice, the 16th selection overall (the teams also swapped third-round picks as part of the deal), and selected [[Jerry Rice]] from [[Mississippi Valley State University|Mississippi Valley State]]. It was reported that the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 17th selection overall, were intending to pick him. In the 1985 season, the 49ers were not as dominant as in 1984, finishing the regular season with a 10\u20136 record and a wild card berth. Jerry Rice struggled at times (dropping numerous passes), but he still impressed the NFL in his rookie season for the 49ers in 1985, especially after a 10-catch, 241-yard game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in December. Rice was named NFC Offensive Rookie of the Year after recording 49 catches for 927 yards, and averaging 19.9 yards per catch, [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] became the first NFL player to gain 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. In the 1985 playoffs, the 49ers were quickly eliminated from the playoffs by the [[New York Giants]] 17\u20133.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/30/sports/giants-stop-49ers-in-wild-card-playoff-17-3.html|title=Giants Stop 49ers in Wild-Card Playoff, 17\u20133|last=Litsky|first=Frank|date=December 30, 1985|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813060009/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/30/sports/giants-stop-49ers-in-wild-card-playoff-17-3.html|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1986 NFL season, the 49ers got off to a quick start after a 31\u20137 win over the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on opening day. But the win was costly; Joe Montana injured his back and was out for two months, the injury was to a spinal disc in Montana's lower back and required immediate surgery. The injury was so severe that Montana's doctors suggested that Montana retire. On September 15, 1986, the 49ers placed Montana on the [[injured reserve list]], [[Jeff Kemp]] became the starting quarterback, and the 49ers went 4\u20133\u20131 in September and October.\n[[File:Jerry Rice jersey.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Rice's No. 80 jersey from December 1987, when he set a new record for touchdowns and receptions with the 49ers]]\n\nMontana returned to the team on November 6 of that year. In his first game back from injury, Montana passed for 270 yards and three touchdown passes in a 43\u201317 49er victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. The 49ers caught fire, winning the next 5 of the final 7 games, including a 24\u201314 win over the [[Los Angeles Rams]], to clinch the NFC West title. Jerry Rice continued to show improvement from the previous season catching 86 passes for a league-leading 1,570 yards and 15 touchdowns. Montana was co-recipient of the 1986 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, which he shared with Vikings quarterback [[Tommy Kramer]]. However, the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] would defeat the 49ers again in the playoffs, 49\u20133 in the team's worst post-season loss to date. Montana was again injured in the first half by a hit from the Giants' [[Jim Burt (American football)|Jim Burt]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/05/sports/montana-is-hospitalized-for-concussion.html | title=Montana Is Hospitalized for Concussion | first=Michael | last=Janofsky | date=January 5, 1987 | work=The New York Times | access-date=December 20, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204070453/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/05/sports/montana-is-hospitalized-for-concussion.html | archive-date=February 4, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the off-season, Bill Walsh was concerned about Montana's health going forward, and with no reliable back-up at quarterback he completed a trade for [[Steve Young]], then a quarterback with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. During the strike-shortened 1987 season, the 49ers became one of the NFL's elite teams once again with a league-best 13\u20132 record. Joe Montana had a bounce-back year after his injuries the previous year and being questioned by the media if he could still produce at a high level, by throwing 31 touchdown passes, a career-high. He also set the NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts without an incomplete pass (22), passed for 3,054 yards, and had a passer rating of 102.1. Rice had established himself as an elite receiver, he caught 65 passes for 1,078 yards and a then NFL-record 22 touchdowns in just 12 games. 1987 was the second of six seasons in which Rice would lead the NFL in receiving or touchdown receptions, he was named [[National Football League Offensive Player of the Year Award|Offensive Player of the Year]]. By the end of the regular season the 49ers were ranked No. 1 on both offense and defense and were heavy favorites to win the Super Bowl. However, they were stunned in the [[1987\u201388 NFL playoffs#NFC: Minnesota Vikings 36, San Francisco 49ers 24|NFC divisional round]], losing 36\u201324 to what was believed to be an inferior [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] team, their third straight playoff loss. Joe Montana had one of the worst post-season games of his career and was eventually benched during the game in favor of Steve Young, who scored a rushing touchdown and threw another. After the game, owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.|Eddie DeBartolo]] stripped Walsh of the team president title.

Many speculated that the 1988 season would be his last year with the team. In the [[1988 NFL season]], the 49ers struggled to start the season; Walsh would constantly switch QBs between Montana (who suffered an elbow injury week 1 that would linger for most of the season) and Young. At one point, they were 6\u20135 and the team was in danger of missing the playoffs.

Following the Eagles game, a poll conducted on local sports radio station [[KNBR (AM)|KNBR]] showed that an overwhelming majority of 49er fans wanted head coach George Seifert fired. The game against the Eagles was a turning point for the 49ers despite the lopsided score. Quarterback Steve Young was benched in the 3rd quarter and was later seen on the sidelines, shouting profanities at Seifert. The following week in Detroit, the 49ers trailed the [[1994 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] 7\u20130. After throwing a pass, Young was hit, picked up, and driven into the ground by three Lions defenders. He crawled most of the way off of the field before refusing help from the trainers as he limped the remaining way off the field. He returned to the field two plays later (NFL rules state that after trainers attend to an injured player, that player must leave the field for at least one play) to lead the 49ers to a 27\u201321 victory. The team rallied around Young to win 10 straight games, including a 21\u201314 victory over the two-time defending Super Bowl champion [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. During that span the 49ers' average margin of victory was nearly 20 points per game, a sustained dominance not seen since the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]]. Despite scoring only 8 points in one game and 14 in another, the 49ers set a new record for total regular-season and post-season combined points scored. That record was later broken by the [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in 2007 (the 1998 Minnesota Vikings scored 556 regular-season points, but only 68 postseason points, for a total of 624 points, while the 1994 49ers scored 495 regular-season points and 131 postseason points for a total of 626, the second-highest mark in NFL history).

shield-shaped crest formed from the number \"49\", with a football in the upper right quadrant and \"SF\" in the lower-left quadrant was created in 1965 and used for marketing purposes until 1972. From 1962, the 49ers' logo has been the iconic \"SF\" within the center of a red oval; throughout the years the logo has had minor modifications, such as a black outlining on the intertwined \"SF\" that was added in 1989 and a gold trimming inside the oval that was added in 1996.\n\n===Uniforms===\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = horizontal\n| header            = \n| header_align      = left/right/center\n| header_background = \n| footer            = \n| footer_align      = left/right/center\n| footer_background = \n| image1            = Raheem Mostert 2020.jpg\n| caption1          = 2021 home uniform, worn by former 49ers running back [[Raheem Mostert]]\n| image2            = 49ers at Redskins 2019, George Kittle (48933294286).jpg\n| caption2          = 2021 road uniform, worn by [[George Kittle]]\n| total_width       = 300\n}}\nThe San Francisco 49ers have two different [[uniforms]]: red and gold home uniforms and white, red, and gold road uniforms. However, the 49ers have changed uniform designs and color combinations quite often throughout their history. From the team's inception in 1946, they wore dark or cardinal red, switching to scarlet red jerseys and gold pants for the 1948 season, with a gold helmet with one red stripe, with solid red socks and pants with no stripes. Entering the 1949 season, the first in the NFL, the 49ers adopted three stripes to their red jerseys, wearing gold helmets and pants, with no stripes and red socks with three white stripes. In the 1953, '54, and '55 seasons, the 49ers wore red helmets with a gold stripe in the middle, with silver pants with one single stripe of red. The socks also added the three stripes similar to the jersey's. 1955 was also unique in that the 49ers wore white pants with a black stripe bounded by two red stripes, and shadow drop numbers on their red jerseys, with black shadow drop borders on the white numerals. The following season, 1956, the team wore white helmets with no stripes, and white pants with a red stripe. In 1957 the 49ers wore red jerseys, a gold helmet with no stripes, and gold pants with no stripes; for the first time the 49ers wore white on the road, as dictated by the NFL for all teams, to have at least one team wearing a light-colored jersey during games. The first white jersey had two red stripes with a gold in the middle, as was their road socks: white, with two red stripes and gold in the middle. San Francisco wore red and gold in 1958 as well, with their white jersey having a single shoulder loop stripe, as well as adding TV numbers to the sleeves of their home and away jerseys. And in contrast to the socks at home, red with three red stripes, the away socks were solid red. In 1959 the team switched to red and platinum gold (looking more like silver), and for the next several years afterwards, with their white jerseys having double shoulder loop stripes (mimicking UCLA's), but continuing with the three white stripes on the sleeves above the elbow and below the TV numbers, with the red home jerseys. In 1960, the team added \"Northwestern\" red stripes to their helmets (a thicker middle stripe bordered by two thinner stripes), and that changed in 1962, with the addition of the helmet design the team has mostly worn since: white stripe bounded by two red, with the red oval and SF logo on the sides of the helmet. In 1964 the team's colors then changed again. All silver elements were changed to what was called \"49er Gold;\" helmets were gold. New beige-gold pants with a red-white-red tri-stripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced. Uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next 30 seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970 to 1974 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season). The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping were worn until 1995 with a few minor changes. During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore \"throwback uniforms\" on occasional games to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams) . The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that were outlined and shadowed in black with White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks. The regular 1989\u201395 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 helmet.\n\nIn 1996, the 49ers celebrated their 49th anniversary by designing a commemorative jersey patch based on the earlier shield-crest logo. The team also debuted a substantially new uniform design, most notably changing the shade of red used in their jerseys from bright scarlet to a deeper, cardinal red a black dropshadow effect (along with gold trim) was added to the jersey numerals (which remained in the blocked serif style). As in 1994, the Niners donned white pants full-time for the 1996 season (also wearing them for the 1997 season and 1998 preseason,) though this time the pant stripes were marginally thicker and the colors were reversed to black-cardinal red-black (matching the striping on the helmets). For the 1998 regular-season opener, the team switched back to gold pants, with a more metallic gold rather than the previous beige-matte gold of the past. The striping along the side of the pants remained black-cardinal red-black, though a thin gold trimming was added, along with further oval \"SF\" logos placed on both sides of the hip.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hecken |first=Phil |date=February 1, 2020 |title=Supe's On: San Francisco 49ers Uniform History \u203a Uni Watch |url=https://uni-watch.com/2020/02/01/supes-on-san-francisco-49ers-uniform-history/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211123153316/https://uni-watch.com/2020/02/01/supes-on-san-francisco-49ers-uniform-history/ |archive-date=November 23, 2021 |access-date=November 23, 2021 |website=Uni Watch}}</ref>\n\nThe 1996 helmet and jersey design with the 1998 gold pants was worn as the team's regular uniforms until the end of the 2008 season. The 49ers once again changed uniforms in 2009, which are very similar to the classic design, albeit with several significant changes. The sleeve stripes are now set at an angle to accommodate the even shorter sleeves of modern jerseys, (though the stripes appear straight and parallel to the ground when worn by the players themselves).<ref>{{cite news|last=Price|first=Taylor|title=49ers Unveil Classic Uniforms|url=https://www.49ers.com/news/49ers-unveil-classic-uniforms-490491|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=April 25, 2009|access-date=May 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508021911/https://www.49ers.com/news/49ers-unveil-classic-uniforms-490491|archive-date=May 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> An updated 49ers uniform with improved fit, and more breathable and moisture-resistant fabrics was debuted (alongside the rest of the NFL teams) by new league uniform manufacturer [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] on April 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Price|first=Taylor|title=Morning Tailgate: Uniform Edition (April 3)|url=http://blog.49ers.com/2012/04/03/morning-tailgate-uniform-edition-april-3/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=April 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405210202/http://blog.49ers.com/2012/04/03/morning-tailgate-uniform-edition-april-3|archive-date=April 5, 2012|access-date=October 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 2015, at their [[2015 NFL draft|NFL draft]] rally, the team unveiled their first ever alternate uniform (as opposed to a throwback design).

The two teams began an exchange of heated regular season matchups following the NFL's realignment in 2002 that relocated both teams into the same division. Prior to 2002, the teams played each other almost every season during the pre-season, but only every three years during the regular season as part of the league scheduling algorithm. The rivalry began to intensify after the 49ers hired [[Jim Harbaugh]] out of [[Stanford University|Stanford]] in 2011, as he and Seahawks and former [[University of Southern California|USC]] head coach [[Pete Carroll]] had been involved in a lengthy feud. The matchups regularly grew in intensity through the 2010s, culminating in the two teams meeting in the 2013 NFC Championship which saw Seattle advance and ultimately on to win [[Super Bowl XLVIII]].<ref name=\"s703\">{{cite web | title=Richard Sherman reflects on 10th anniversary of iconic 'Crabtree' postgame interview | work=FOX Sports | date=2024-01-25 | url=https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/richard-sherman-reflects-on-10th-anniversary-of-iconic-crabtree-postgame-interview | access-date=2024-08-30}}</ref> As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the all-time series 30\u201322.<ref>{{Cite web |title=All Matchups, San Francisco 49ers vs. Seattle Seahawks |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=sfo&tm2=sea&yr=all |access-date=2024-08-05 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Arizona Cardinals====\n{{Main|49ers\u2013Cardinals rivalry}}\nThough the 49ers and [[Arizona Cardinals|Cardinals]] initially met in 1951 and would meet occasionally until 2000, this would not develop into a full-fledged rivalry until both teams were placed in the NFC West division in 2002.

From that point, the Packers beat the 49ers four more times including two post-season games. San Francisco was finally able to exact revenge in the 1998 NFC Wild Card round, a game that is remembered for a 25-yard game-winning touchdown reception by [[Terrell Owens]] off a [[Steve Young]] pass (referred to by some as \"[[The Catch II]]\"), lifting the 49ers over the Packers 30\u201327. Since that game, the Packers had beaten the 49ers eight straight times including once in the 2001 post-season, a streak that came to an end in the 2012 season when the 49ers beat the Packers in [[Lambeau Field]] week 1 for the first time since 1990, and again in the NFC Divisional game that same season. In the 2019 season the 49ers and Packers met in the 2020 NFC Championship game at Levi's Stadium where the 49ers won 37\u201320, but went on to lose [[Super Bowl LIV]] to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. The Packers also proceeded to lose to the 49ers in the Divisional Round in the 2021\u20132022 season. The 49ers trail the all-time series with a record of 32\u201337\u20131, though San Francisco holds a 6\u20134 lead in the postseason, winning the last five meetings.<ref>{{Cite web |title=All Matchups, San Francisco 49ers vs. Green Bay Packers |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=sfo&tm2=gnb&yr=all |access-date=2024-08-05 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Dallas Cowboys====\n{{main|49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry}}\nThe rivalry between the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and the 49ers has lasted since the 1970s. The [[NFL Top 10]] ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in NFL history. San Francisco has played Dallas in nine postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC championship game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' [[Joe Montana]] complete a game-winning pass to [[Dwight Clark]] in the final minute (now known as '''The Catch'''), is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC championship game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are third all-time in [[Super Bowl]] victories to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[New England Patriots]] with five each. The 49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. In recent years, this once-great rivalry has greatly softened, with the struggles of both the Cowboys and 49ers. However, in its prime especially in the 1990s, this rivalry was a very bitter one as both teams were the class of the NFL during this time. In what was believed to be the greatest upset in the team's rivalry in the modern era, the 49ers upset the Cowboys in the 2021 Wild Card Round.\nThe 2022 49ers would go on to continue their winning streak against the Cowboys winning the divisional round game 19\u201312. The Cowboys' loss to the 49ers was their seventh straight in the divisional round, which is the longest streak in the second round of the NFL playoffs. In Week 5 of 2023\u201324 season, the 49ers beat the Cowboys 42\u201310, making it the largest win margin for the 49ers in the history of the rivalry. The 49ers lead the all-time series between the two including playoffs 20\u201319\u20131.<ref>{{Cite web |title=All Matchups, San Francisco 49ers vs. Dallas Cowboys |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=sfo&tm2=dal&yr=all |access-date=2024-08-05 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n====New York Giants====\n{{main|49ers\u2013Giants rivalry}}\n\nThe [[New York Giants]] have the most playoff meetings versus the 49ers (eight). The playoff series is currently tied at four wins a piece, and in five of their eight meetings, the winning team has gone on to win the [[Super Bowl]]. This rivalry is rooted in the 1980s when both teams were on the rise. In the first two playoff meetings between these two teams, the [[Joe Montana]]-led 49ers won both meetings, 38\u201324 in [[1981 NFL season|1981]] and 21\u201310 in [[1984 NFL season|1984]] both in the divisional round at [[Candlestick Park]]; the 49ers went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The Giants won the next three playoff meetings, which included a 49\u20133 rout at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[1986 NFL season|1986]], and the [[1990 NFL season|1990 NFC championship]], where they upset the 49ers 15\u201313, ruining the 49ers hopes of a Super Bowl three-peat after [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter and let the Giants score on a last-second field goal. Giants also went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons.

The teams met again in the [[2011 NFL season|2011 NFC championship]] at Candlestick Park, and just like the 1990 NFC championship, it was a low-scoring game; the Giants won the game on a [[Lawrence Tynes]] 31-yard field goal in overtime, 20\u201317. In an eerie similarity to Roger Craig's fumble 21 years earlier, [[Kyle Williams (wide receiver)|Kyle Williams]] fumbled a punt in the crucial minutes of the game, and just like the last two times, the Giants beat the 49ers in the playoffs, they went on to win the Super Bowl.

[[Garrison Hearst]] suffered an ankle break after his foot was caught in the [[Georgia Dome]] turf and twisted severely as he tried to spin away from Falcons' defensive end [[Chuck Smith (defensive end)|Chuck Smith]] on the first play from [[Line of scrimmage|scrimmage]]; the 49ers lost that game 20\u201318. They met in the [[2012\u201313 NFL playoffs|2012 NFC championship]], in which the 49ers, led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, defeated the top-seeded Falcons in Atlanta by a score of 28\u201324.

The rivalry still remained heated when [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|the Raiders moved to Los Angeles]], leaving many Raider fans in Northern California bitter over the move, and some of them becoming 49er fans, added with the antagonism between Northern and Southern California. The Raiders notably upset the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers in San Francisco in 1982, winning 23\u201317.  In addition, both teams have shared a number of players, most notably [[Jim Plunkett]], [[Jerry Rice]], [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Michael Crabtree]], [[Tom Rathman]], and [[Charlie Garner]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Players who played for Las Vegas Raiders and San Francisco 49ers |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/friv/players-who-played-for-multiple-teams-franchises.fcgi?level=franch&t1=rai&t2=sfo&t3=--&t4=-- |access-date=2024-08-30 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn August 20, 2011, in the third week of the pre-season, the pre-season game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at [[Candlestick Park]] including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured.

The final regular season matchup of the \"Battle of the Bay\" was won by San Francisco by a score of 34\u20133 on November 1, 2018, leaving the series tied 7\u20137. In 2020, the Raiders began playing their home games at [[Allegiant Stadium]] in Las Vegas, effectively ending the geographic rivalry. The San Francisco 49ers would meet with the Raiders for the first time in Las Vegas on January 1, 2023. The 49ers would take a slim overtime win in with a field goal ending the game 37\u201334.

The final game in AAFC history matched the two for the [[All-America Football Conference playoffs#1949|AAFC Championship]], which Cleveland won 21\u20137. The rivalry did not last into the NFL years, particularly after the teams were placed in opposite conferences in {{nfly|1970}}.  The rivalry has turned into a friendly relationship as many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999, specifically former 49ers president and CEO [[Carmen Policy]] and vice president/director of football operations [[Dwight Clark]], who were hired by the expansion Browns in the same roles.
