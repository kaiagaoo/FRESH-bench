Before that, some teams had secretly paid certain players. The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another. The period before 1920 was the [[dead-ball era]], when [[home run]]s were rarely hit. Professional baseball in the United States survived the [[Black Sox Scandal]], a conspiracy to [[match fixing|fix]] the [[1919 World Series]]. The sport rose in popularity in the 1920s and survived potential downturns during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]. Shortly after the war, [[Jackie Robinson]] broke [[baseball color line|baseball's color barrier]].\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were a time of club expansion and [[Major League Baseball relocation of 1950s\u201360s|relocation]] for the AL and NL. Modern stadiums with [[artificial turf]] surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game during the 1990s, and media reports disclosed the use of [[anabolic steroid]]s among MLB players in the mid-2000s. In 2006, an investigation produced the [[Mitchell Report]], which implicated many players in the use of [[performance-enhancing drugs|performance-enhancing substances]], including at least one player from each team.\n\nEach team plays 162 games per season, and six teams in each league advance to a four-round [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason tournament]] that culminates in the [[World Series]], a [[best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] championship series between the two league champions that dates back to 1903. Baseball games are broadcast on television, radio, and the internet throughout North America and in several other countries. MLB has the [[List of attendance figures at domestic professional sports leagues|highest total season attendance]] of any sports league in the world with more than 69.6 million spectators in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Maury|title=Why MLB Attendance Dropped Below 70 Million For The First Time In 15 Years|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2018/10/03/how-mlb-attendance-dropped-below-70-million-for-first-time-in-15-years/#7b44d74d61bf|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=October 3, 2018|access-date=April 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMLB also oversees [[Minor League Baseball]], which comprises lower-tier teams affiliated with the major league clubs.

Two teams (the [[Seattle Mariners]] and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]) were also added in the 1970s. From 1969 through 1993, each league consisted of an East and West Division. In 1993, the National League expanded with two teams, the [[Miami Marlins|Florida Marlins]] and the [[Colorado Rockies]], to even up the number of teams in both leagues. A third division, the Central Division, was formed in each league in 1994. Until 1996, the two leagues met on the field only during the [[World Series]] and the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]].

This addition brought the total number of franchises to 30. In early 1997, MLB decided to assign one new team to each league: Tampa Bay joined the AL and Arizona joined the NL. The original plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league (15 per league, with five in each division), but in order for every team to be able to play daily, this would have required interleague play to be scheduled throughout the entire season. However, it was unclear at the time if the interleague play would continue after the 1998 season, as it had to be approved by the players' union. For this and other reasons, it was decided that both leagues should continue to have an even number of teams, and therefore, one existing club would have to switch leagues. The [[Milwaukee Brewers#1994\u201398: Realignment / \"We're taking this thing National\"|Milwaukee Brewers]] agreed in November 1997 to move from the AL to the NL, thereby making the NL a 16-team league.

The league placed its emphasis on clubs rather than on players. Clubs could now enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league championship, which happened frequently under the NA. A concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games, which was leaving the validity of results in doubt. The first game in the NL\u2014on Saturday, April 22, 1876 (at [[Jefferson Street Grounds]] in [[Philadelphia]])\u2014is often pointed to as the beginning of MLB.<ref>[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1876/04221876.htm Events of Saturday, April 22, 1876].

Teams came and went; 1882 was the first season where the league's membership was the same as the preceding season's, and only four franchises survived to see 1900. Competitor leagues formed regularly and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (1882\u20131891), sometimes called the \"beer and whiskey league\" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the NL and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series\u2014the first attempt at a [[World Series]]. The two leagues merged in 1892 as a single 12-team NL, but the NL dropped four teams after the 1899 season. This led to the formation of the [[American League]] in 1901 under AL president [[Ban Johnson]], and the resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}\n\nThe war between the AL and NL caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence.

Games of this era tended to be low-scoring and were often dominated by pitchers, such as [[Walter Johnson]], [[Cy Young]], [[Christy Mathewson]], [[Mordecai Brown]], and [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]. The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself.

During this era, a baseball cost three dollars, equal to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3|1919|r=2}}}} today (in inflation-adjusted [[United States dollar|USD]]), and owners were reluctant to purchase new balls. Fans were expected to throw back fouls and (rare) home runs. Baseballs also became stained with tobacco juice, grass, and mud, and sometimes the juice of licorice, which some players would chew for the purpose of discoloring the ball.<ref name=Keating>{{cite news|last=Keating|first=Peter|title=The game that Ruth built|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/05/07/the_game_that_ruth_built/|publisher=[[Boston.com]]|access-date=November 24, 2013 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918184533/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/05/07/the_game_that_ruth_built/|archive-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlso, pitchers could manipulate the ball through the use of the [[spitball]]. (In 1921 use of this pitch was restricted to a few pitchers with a [[grandfather clause]].) Additionally, many ballparks had large dimensions, such as the [[West Side Grounds]] of the Chicago Cubs, which was {{convert|560|ft}} to the center field fence, and the [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]], which was {{convert|635|ft}} to the center field fence, thus home runs were rare, and \"small ball\" tactics such as [[single (baseball)|singles]], [[Bunt (baseball)|bunts]], [[stolen base]]s, and the [[hit and run (baseball)|hit-and-run]] play dominated the strategies of the time.<ref>Daniel Okrent, Harris Lewine, David Nemec (2000) \"The Ultimate Baseball Book\", Houghton Mifflin Books, {{ISBN|0-618-05668-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=mAbGN_1cmhcC&pg=PA33&dq=\"inside+baseball\" p. 33].</ref> Hitting methods like the [[Baltimore Chop]] were used to increase the number of infield singles.<ref>{{cite book|first=Burt|last=Solomon|date=1999|title=Where They Ain't: The Fabled Life And Untimely Death Of The Original Baltimore Orioles|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-684-85917-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ooF5NtRmJbwC}}.</ref> On a successful Baltimore chop, the batter hits the ball forcefully into the ground, causing it to bounce so high that the batter reaches first base before the ball can be fielded and thrown to the first baseman.<ref name=Lieb>{{cite book|last=Lieb|first=Fred|title=The Baltimore Orioles: The History of a Colorful Team in Baltimore and St. Louis|year=1955|publisher=[[SIU Press]]|isbn=0-8093-8972-X|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BahcUaZZebYC&q=%22baltimore+chop%22&pg=PA46}}</ref>\n\nThe adoption of the foul strike rule in the early twentieth century quickly sent baseball from a high-scoring game to one where scoring runs became a struggle. Prior to the institution of this rule, foul balls were not counted as strikes: a batter could foul off any number of pitches with no strikes counted against him; this gave an enormous advantage to the batter. In 1901, the NL adopted the foul strike rule, and the AL followed suit in 1903.<ref>{{Cite web |title=MLB Rule Changes {{!}} Baseball Almanac |url=https://www.baseball-almanac.com/rulechng.shtml |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=www.baseball-almanac.com |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1919 World Series]] between the [[Chicago White Sox]] and Cincinnati Reds, baseball was rocked by allegations of a [[game fixing]] scheme known as the [[Black Sox Scandal]].

The 1920 season was notable for the death of [[Ray Chapman]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]]. Chapman, who was struck in the head by a pitch and died a few hours later, became the only MLB player to die of an on-field injury, a tragedy which led directly to both leagues requiring the placing into play new, white baseballs whenever a ball became scuffed or dirty, helping bring the \"dead-ball\" era to an end.

Baseball owners cut their [[Major League Baseball rosters|rosters]] from 25 men to 23 men, and even the best players took pay cuts.

Black baseball fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning the Negro league teams that they had followed exclusively. Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspaper writers and white major league players.

Two new teams were added to the American League at the same time: the [[Los Angeles Angels]] (who soon moved from downtown L.A. to nearby [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]) and a new [[Washington Senators (1961\u20131971)|Washington Senators]] franchise. The NL added the [[Houston Astros]] and the [[New York Mets]] in 1962. The Astros (known as the \"Colt .45s\" during their first three seasons) became the first southern major league franchise since the [[Louisville Colonels]] folded in 1899 and the first franchise to be located along the [[Gulf Coast]]. The Mets established a reputation for futility by going 40\u2013120 during their first season of play in the nation's media capital\u2014and by playing only a little better in subsequent campaigns\u2014but in their eighth season (1969) the Mets became the first of the 1960s expansion teams to play in the postseason, culminating in a World Series title over the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles.\n\nIn 1966, the major leagues moved to the \"Deep South\" when the Braves moved to Atlanta. In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics moved west to become the [[Oakland Athletics]]. In 1969, the American and National Leagues both [[1969 Major League Baseball expansion|added two expansion franchises]]. The American League added the [[Seattle Pilots]] (who became the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] after one disastrous season in Seattle) and the [[Kansas City Royals]]. The NL added the first Canadian franchise, the [[Montreal Expos]], as well as the [[San Diego Padres]].\n\nIn 1972, the second Washington Senators moved to the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]] to become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].

Because of climate and economic issues, many of these facilities had playing surfaces made from [[artificial turf]], as well as the oval designs characteristic of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260764-timeline-artificial-turf-in-major-league-baseball|title=Timeline: Artificial turf in Major League Baseball|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=September 24, 2009|access-date=October 13, 2013 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024070428/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260764-timeline-artificial-turf-in-major-league-baseball|archive-date=October 24, 2013}}</ref> This often resulted in baseball fields with relatively more [[foul territory]] than older stadiums. These characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball, putting a higher premium on speed and defense over home-run hitting power since the fields were often too big for teams to expect to hit many home runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}\n\nTeams began to be built around pitching\u2014particularly their bullpens\u2014and speed on the basepaths. Artificial surfaces meant balls traveled quicker and bounced higher, so it became easier to hit [[ground ball]]s \"[[in the hole]]\" between the corner and middle infielders. Starting pitchers were no longer expected to throw [[complete game]]s; it was enough for a starter to pitch 6\u20137 innings and turn the game over to the team's [[closer (baseball)|closer]], a position which grew in importance over these decades. As stolen bases increased, home run totals dropped. After [[Willie Mays]] hit 52 home runs in 1965, only one player ([[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]]) reached that mark until the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}\n\n===Scandals and a changing game===\nDuring the 1980s, baseball experienced a number of significant changes the game had not seen in years. Home runs were on the decline throughout the decade, with players hitting only 40 home runs just 13 times and no one hitting more than 50 home runs in a season for the first time since the Dead-ball era (1900\u20131919).<ref name=\"parade\">{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/408556/parade/1980s-the-decade-baseballs-innocence-ended/|title=1980s: The Decade Baseball's Innocence Ended|date=July 3, 2015|publisher=Parade Magazine|author=Gammons, Peter|access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"SABR80s\">{{cite web|url=https://sabr.org/research/baseball-s-forgotten-era-80s|title=1Baseball's Forgotten Era: The '80s|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research (SABR)|author=D\u2019Addona, Dan|access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1981 Major League Baseball strike]] from June 12 until July 31 forced the cancellation of 713 total games and resulted in a split-season format.\n\nIn 1985, [[Pete Rose]] broke [[Ty Cobb]]'s all-time hits record with his 4,192nd hit, and in 1989 Rose received a lifetime ban from baseball as a result of betting on baseball games while manager of the [[Cincinnati Reds]].

In 1998, the Brewers switched leagues by joining the National League, and two new teams were added: the NL's [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and the AL's [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] in [[Tampa Bay area|Tampa Bay]].\n\nAfter the 2001 season, the team owners [[2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan|voted in favor of contraction]]. Several MLB teams had been considered for elimination in early talks about contraction, but the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins were the two teams that came closest to folding under the plan. Plans for MLB contraction were halted when the Twins landlord was awarded a court injunction that required the team to play its 2002 home games at their stadium.

This move left Canada with just one team, but it also returned baseball to Washington after a 33-year absence. This franchise shift, like many previous ones, involved baseball's return to a city that had been previously abandoned. Not counting the short-lived Federal League, Montreal is the only city to host an MLB franchise since 1901 that, {{as of|December 2022}}, does not currently have a team.\n\n=== The modern game ===\nIn recent years, with the advent of technologies such as [[Statcast]] and its use of [[Hawk-Eye]] starting in 2020<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jedlovec |first=Ben |date=21 July 2020 |title=Introducing Statcast 2020: Hawk-Eye and Google Cloud |url=https://technology.mlblogs.com/introducing-statcast-2020-hawk-eye-and-google-cloud-a5f5c20321b8 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220611021945/https://technology.mlblogs.com/introducing-statcast-2020-hawk-eye-and-google-cloud-a5f5c20321b8?gi=45ab069f1322 |archive-date=11 June 2022 |access-date=28 October 2022 |website=MLB Technology Blog}}</ref> as well as with advanced statistics as provided by sites such as [[FanGraphs]] and Baseball Savant, MLB has evolved. With the ability to see precise movements of pitchers and batters, teams can assess the mechanics of a player and help them improve. Statcast also provides some features such as tracking the paths of most batted balls, tracking the speed of most batted balls, and tracking the exit velocity of most batted balls. Statcast has allowed for advanced defensive analytics that haven't been possible before tracking of players due to how subjective fielding can be.\n\nThe rate of teams using a [[Baseball positioning|defensive shift]] has gone up from 13.7% in 2016 to 33.6% in 2022 because advanced statistics support this as an effective way to stop hitters from getting hits.<ref>{{Cite web |title=MLB Team Fielder Positioning |url=https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/visuals/team-positioning |access-date=2022-10-28 |website=baseballsavant.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Because the shift reduces the amount of balls in play that result in hits and MLB wishes to increase interest in baseball, MLB announced in September 2022 that extreme infield defensive shifts would be banned starting in 2023. In order to be compliant, there must be 2 fielders on each side of second base, and those fielders must have both of their feet on the infield dirt at the time the pitch is thrown. If this rule is not followed, the choice of an automatic ball or the outcome of the play is given to the batting team.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |date=2022-09-09 |title=MLB approves sweeping set of rules changes |url=https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/34556355/major-league-baseball-passes-significant-rules-changes-including-pitch-clock-banning-defensive-shifts |access-date=2022-10-28 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe game of baseball has also slowed down significantly due to an increased number of strikeouts and walks \u2014 two outcomes that generally take many pitches to complete \u2014 and an increased amount of time taken for a pitcher to pitch. In 2020, it took an average of three hours and six minutes to complete a 9 inning game, a number which has steadily ticked up for years.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Verducci |first=Tom |title=MLB Can't Wait Any Longer to Fix Its Pace of Play Crisis |url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2021/03/17/baseball-preview-pace-of-play-crisis |access-date=2022-10-28 |website=Sports Illustrated |language=en-us}}</ref> Along with the restrictions on defensive shifts, the MLB announced the introduction of a pitch clock for the 2023 season and beyond, which is something that has been an experiment in MiLB for a few years. The pitch clock starts at 15 seconds. By the time the clock reaches 10 seconds, the catcher must be in their crouch behind home plate. When the clock reaches 8 seconds, the batter must be in the batter's box and be \"alert\". Before the 15 second timer reaches 0 seconds, the pitcher must have started their \"motion to pitch\". If any of these deadlines are violated, the count of the batter will be increased by one ball if the defending team violated the pitch clock or one strike if it is the offensive team who violated the pitch clock. Additionally, in order to prevent circumventing these rules pickoffs and step-offs which reset the pitch clock are only allowed two times total per plate appearance and, if a pitcher attempts a third pickoff and fails to get the runner out, a balk will be called. Similarly, a batter is restricted to calling a timeout (an action which resets the pitch clock) just once per plate appearance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Uniforms==\n[[File:Cleveland Indians 22nd Consecutive Win (37081433606).jpg|thumb|left|[[Cleveland Indians]] throwback uniform]]\n{{Main|Major League Baseball uniforms|Baseball uniform}}\nA [[baseball uniform]] is a type of uniform worn by [[position player|baseball players]], and by some non-playing personnel, such as [[Manager (baseball)|field managers]] and coaches.

Teams hold training camps in the states of Arizona and Florida, where the early warm weather allows teams to practice and play without worrying about the late winter cold. Spring training allows new players to compete for roster and position spots and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play. The teams that hold spring training in Arizona are grouped into the [[Cactus League]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cactusleague.com/|title=Cactus League|access-date=October 13, 2013}}</ref> while teams that hold camp in Florida are known as the [[Grapefruit League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridagrapefruitleague.com/|title=Florida's Grapefruit League|access-date=October 13, 2013}}</ref> Spring training has always attracted fan attention, drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the weather and watch their favorite teams play, and spring training usually coincides with [[spring break]] for many college students. Autograph seekers also find greater access to players during spring training.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}\n\nSpring training typically lasts almost two months, starting in mid-February and running until just before the season-opening day, traditionally the first week of April. As pitchers benefit from a longer training period, pitchers and catchers begin spring training several days before the rest of the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/spring-training|title=MLB: Spring Training|access-date=October 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Regular season===\nEach team plays 162 games per season. A team's schedule is typically organized into three-game [[series (baseball)|series]], sets of consecutive games against the same opponent, with occasional two- or four-game series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/schedule/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_schedule#date=10/14/2013|title=MLB Schedule|work=[[MLB.com]]|access-date=October 14, 2013}}</ref> Postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one-game or five-game series. All games of a series are usually hosted by the same team and multiple series are typically grouped together. I.e, a team usually hosts several series in a row, called a homestand, and follows that by going on several road series in a row. Teams generally play games five to seven days per week. Most games are scheduled at night, although teams will often play day games on Opening Day, holidays, and for the last game of a series to allow teams extra time to travel to their next opponent. Sunday games are generally played during the afternoon, allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior to a Monday night game.\n\nIn the current three-division structure, each team plays 19 games against each of its four divisional opponents. It plays one home series and one away series, amounting to six or seven games, against the 10 other teams in its league. A team also plays one of the divisions in the other league, rotating each year, with two opponents in a three-game home series, two in a three-game away series, and one with four games split between home and away. Furthermore, each team has an interleague \"natural rival\" (in many cases its counterpart in the same metro area) with which it plays two home games and two away games each year.\n\nWith an odd number of teams in each league (15), it is necessary to have two teams participate in interleague play for most days in the season, except when two or more teams have a day off. Each team plays 20 interleague games throughout the season, usually with just one interleague game per day, but for one weekend in late May, all teams will participate in an interleague series. Before 2013, interleague play was structured differently: there would be one weekend in mid-May and another period consisting typically of the last two-thirds of June in which all teams played interleague games (save for two NL teams each day), and no interleague games were scheduled outside those dates. (Before 2013, season-long interleague play was not necessary, because each league had an even number of teams. In 2013, the Houston Astros moved to the American League, so that each league would have [[#League organization|15 teams]].) Prior to the adoption of the universal designated hitter in 2022, whether the DH was in use depended on whether the home team was from the AL, where the DH was used, or the NL, where it was not.\n\nStarting with the 2023 season, the scheduling formula is set to change, with each team playing at least one series against every other team every year. Each team will play 14 games against teams in the same division, with one 3-game and one 4-game series at each park, six games against teams within the same league but in other divisions, with one 3-game series at each park, and one 3-game series against teams in the other league, alternating home teams each year, except for each team's designated interleague rival, which will continue to consist of two 2-game series at each of the teams' home parks.\n\nBeginning with the 2022 season, teams compete for the six [[Playoffs|playoff]] berths in their respective leagues. To secure a berth, a team must either win its [[MLB#League organization|division]] or capture a [[MLB Wild Card|wild card spot]] by having one of the three best records among the non-winners in its entire league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings#20130930|title=MLB: Regular Season|work=[[MLB.com]]|access-date=October 14, 2013}}</ref> With the adoption of a third wild card, the former practice of breaking ties with an additional regular-season game, known as  [[game 163]], was dropped in favor of a tie-breaker formula.\n\n===All-Star Game===\n{{Main|Major League Baseball All-Star Game}}\n[[File:President attends the 32nd All-Star Baseball Game, throws out first ball.
