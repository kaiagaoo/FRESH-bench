Traditional away [[kit (football)|kit]] colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled ''Famous Football Clubs \u2013 Manchester City'' published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.<ref>James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City'' pp. 14\u201315</ref> The infrequent yet recurrent use of red and black away colours comes from former assistant manager [[Malcolm Allison]]'s belief that adopting the colours of [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] would inspire City to glory.<ref>{{cite news| title=Nicking the shirts off their backs| work=The Guardian| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/theknowledge/story/0,13854,1643916,00.html| access-date=18 December 2006| location=London| first=Georgina| last=Turner| date=23 November 2005| archive-date=20 March 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320093647/http://football.guardian.co.uk/theknowledge/story/0,13854,1643916,00.html| url-status=live}}</ref> Allison's theory seemingly took effect, with City winning the [[1969 FA Cup final]], [[1970 Football League Cup final|1970 League Cup final]], and [[1970 European Cup Winners' Cup final|1970 Cup Winners' Cup final]] in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue.\n\nCity had previously worn three other [[Crest (sports)|badges]] on their shirts, prior to their current badge being implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the present badge (including a ship, based on the [[Symbols of Manchester#Coat of arms|City of Manchester coat of arms]]), inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. In 1976, a [[heraldic badge]] was granted by the [[College of Arms]] to the [[English Football League]] for use by City. The badge consisted of the familiar ship above a red rose but on a circular device instead of a shield (blazoned as \"''A roundel per fess azure and argent in chief a three masted ship sails set pennons flying or in base a rose gules barbed and seeded proper''\").<ref>{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=David Llewelyn |date=Spring 2015 |title=Badges and 'Crests': The Twentieth-Century Relationship Between Football and Heraldry |url=https://www.theheraldrysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CoA-229-Phillips-paper.pdf |journal=The Coat of Arms |volume=XI Part I |issue=229 |page=40,41,45,46 |doi= |access-date=31 January 2022 |archive-date=24 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211224161126/https://www.theheraldrysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CoA-229-Phillips-paper.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn occasions when Manchester City played in a major cup final, the club wore shirts bearing the City of Manchester coat of arms, as a symbol of pride in representing the city at a major event. This practice originated from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind.<ref>David Clayton, ''Everything Under the Blue Moon'' (Mainstream Publishing, 2002), 21</ref> The club has since abandoned the practice; for the [[2011 FA Cup final]], its first in the 21st century, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.<ref>{{cite web | title=Manchester City History | url=http://mcivta.com/history/ | access-date=19 April 2017 | archive-date=19 May 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519185012/http://mcivta.com/history/ | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the [[coat of arms|arms]] of the city of [[Manchester]], and consisted of a shield in front of a [[golden eagle]]. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the city's badge in 1958 (but had since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield featured a ship on its upper half representing the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolised the city's three rivers \u2013 the [[River Irwell|Irwell]], the [[River Irk|Irk]] and the [[River Medlock|Medlock]]. The bottom of the badge bore the motto \"''Superbia in Proelio''\", which translates as \"Pride in Battle\" in [[Latin language|Latin]]. Above the eagle and shield were the three stars, added for decorative purposes.\n\nOn 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news|title=City's new badge is here!|url=https://www.mancity.com/news/club-news/club-news/2016/june/mcfc-new-badge-is-here|website=ManCity.com|date=2 July 2016|access-date=23 April 2020|archive-date=23 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523155546/https://www.mancity.com/news/club-news/club-news/2016/june/mcfc-new-badge-is-here|url-status=live}}</ref> the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to discontinue the current badge and institute a new design.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants.<ref>{{cite web |title=Manchester City to design new badge following consultation with fans |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/24/manchester-city-badge-design-fans-consultation |work=The Guardian |date=24 November 2015 |access-date=19 April 2017 |archive-date=7 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707042914/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/24/manchester-city-badge-design-fans-consultation |url-status=live }}</ref> A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|IPO]] when the design was trademarked on 22 December.<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-35174237 | title=Manchester City's new club badge design leaked online | publisher=BBC News | date=24 December 2015 | access-date=24 December 2015 | archive-date=3 February 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203180329/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-35174237 | url-status=live }}</ref> The new badge was officially unveiled at Manchester City's home match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 26 December.<ref>{{cite news |date=26 December 2015 |access-date=26 December 2015 |work=The Guardian |title=Manchester City unveil new club crest before home game against Sunderland |first=Niall |last=McVeigh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/26/manchester-city-unveil-new-club-crest |archive-date=27 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227011250/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/26/manchester-city-unveil-new-club-crest |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

Before the [[World War II|Second World War]], when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves \"supporters\" of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester [[postcode]] areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.<ref>{{cite web|title=Do You Come From Manchester? |work=Manchester Metropolitan University study |url=http://www.e-space.mmu.ac.uk/e-space/bitstream/2173/12506/1/seasonticketreport%20-%20brown1.pdf |access-date=9 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227194327/http://www.e-space.mmu.ac.uk/e-space/bitstream/2173/12506/1/seasonticketreport%20-%20brown1.pdf |archive-date=27 February 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOver the last few years, Manchester City has also developed a [[Liverpool F.C.\u2013Manchester City F.C. rivalry|notable rivalry]] with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.footballfancast.com/premier-league/eleven-moments-that-made-liverpool-manchester-city-the-biggest-rivalry-in-english-football|title=Eleven moments that made Liverpool-Manchester City the biggest rivalry in English football|date=6 October 2018|author=Malyan, Christy|publisher=Football Fancast|website=footballfancast.com|access-date=7 October 2019|archive-date=7 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191007144104/https://www.footballfancast.com/premier-league/eleven-moments-that-made-liverpool-manchester-city-the-biggest-rivalry-in-english-football|url-status=live}}</ref> currently considered one of the biggest in association football.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liverpool v Man City is now the league's biggest rivalry and the bitterness is growing {{!}} Goal.com|url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-v-man-city-is-now-the-leagues-biggest-rivalry-and/sq7ao88pw6yy1fofai2t2eo0m|access-date=3 December 2020|website=www.goal.com|archive-date=17 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217103150/https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-v-man-city-is-now-the-leagues-biggest-rivalry-and/sq7ao88pw6yy1fofai2t2eo0m|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Like going into the Colosseum' - How Liverpool v Man City became the Premier League's biggest rivalry {{!}} Goal.com|url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/like-going-into-the-colosseum-how-liverpool-v-man-city/fth8z4klovzf108nbtwo9hemz|access-date=3 December 2020|website=www.goal.com|archive-date=7 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201107134210/https://www.goal.com/en/news/like-going-into-the-colosseum-how-liverpool-v-man-city/fth8z4klovzf108nbtwo9hemz|url-status=live}}</ref> Though the two clubs had been involved in a title race in the [[1976\u201377 Football League First Division|1976\u201377 season]], Liverpool and City's modern rivalry began in the 2010s, with the Blues beating Liverpool to the [[2013\u201314 Premier League|2013\u201314 title]] by just two points on the final day of the season.<ref>{{Cite web|title=2013/14 Season Review: Man City deny Liverpool|url=http://www.premierleague.com/news/59027|access-date=24 October 2020|website=www.premierleague.com|archive-date=24 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124124507/https://www.premierleague.com/news/59027|url-status=live}}</ref> In the [[2016 Football League Cup final|final]] of the [[2015\u201316 Football League Cup|2015\u201316 League Cup]], City defeated Liverpool on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] after a 1\u20131 draw.
