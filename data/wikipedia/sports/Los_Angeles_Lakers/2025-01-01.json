The combination of Johnson, a prodigy [[point guard]], and dominant [[Center (basketball)|center]] in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach [[Pat Riley]] in 1981 and addition of forward [[James Worthy]] through the [[1982 NBA draft|1982 draft]] established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the [[1984 NBA Finals|1984 Finals]], but triumphed over them in [[1985 NBA Finals|1985]] and [[1987 NBA Finals|1987]].\n\nAfter Riley departed and Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] for the draft rights to [[Kobe Bryant]] and signed center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] that the Lakers returned to dominance during the early 2000s.
