In the playoffs the Nationals defeated the [[Hammond Calumet Buccaneers]], winning the series in two straight games. In the semifinals, the Nationals lost to the Anderson Duffey Packers for the second straight season in four games. In 1949, when the NBL and the BAA merged into the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], the Nationals were one of seven NBL teams that were brought into the NBA.\n\nThe Nationals were an instant success in the NBA, winning the Eastern Division in the [[1949\u201350 NBA season|1949\u201350 season]], with a league-best record of [[List of National Basketball Association teams by single season win pct|51\u201313]]. In the playoffs the Nationals continued to play solid basketball, beating the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] in two games. Moving on to the Eastern Finals, the Nationals battled the [[New York Knicks|New York Knickerbockers]], beating their big-city rivals in a three-game series. In the NBA Finals, the Nationals faced fellow NBL alums the [[Minneapolis Lakers]]. In Game 1 of the Finals the Nationals lost just their second home game of the season 68\u201366. The Nationals did not recover, as they fell behind 3\u20131 before falling in six games.\n\nDespite several teams leaving the NBA for the [[National Professional Basketball League (1950\u201351)|National Professional Basketball League]] before the 1950\u201351 season, the Nationals decided to stay put. In their second NBA season, [[1950\u201351 NBA season|1950\u201351]], the Nationals played mediocre basketball all season, finishing in fourth place with a record of 32\u201334. In the playoffs the Nationals played their best basketball of the season as they stunned the first-place Warriors in two straight, taking Game 1 on the road in overtime 91\u201389. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals were beaten by the New York Knickerbockers in a hard-fought five-game series, losing the finale by just two points.\n\nCervi, playing less and coaching more, emphasized a patient offense and a scrappy defense, which led the league in the [[1951\u201352 NBA season|1951\u201352 season]] by yielding a stingy 79.5 points per game as the Nationals won the Eastern Division with a solid 40\u201326 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals knocked off the Warriors again in a three-game series. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals fell to the Knickerbockers again, dropping the series in four games.\n\nThe Nationals finished in second place in a hard-fought 3-way battle for first place in the Eastern Division for the [[1952\u201353 NBA season|1952\u201353 season]], with a record of 47\u201324. In the playoffs, the Nationals faced the [[Boston Celtics]] dropping Game 1 at home 87\u201381. Needing a win in Boston to keep their hopes alive, the Nationals took the Celtics deep into overtime before losing in quadruple OT 111\u2013105, in what remains the longest playoff game in NBA history.<ref name=bbdigest>{{citation | title = A March Marathon \u2013 Flashback: 1953's Four-OT Thriller \u2013 Boston Celtics vs. Syracuse Nationals| magazine=Basketball Digest |date = March 2003 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCJ/is_5_30/ai_97615973| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060330051016/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCJ/is_5_30/ai_97615973| url-status=dead| archive-date=March 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe Nationals acquired [[Alex Groza]], and [[Ralph Beard]] as the [[Indianapolis Olympians]] folded leaving the NBA with just 9 teams for the [[1953\u201354 NBA season|1953\u201354 season]]. Once again the Nationals battled for the Division title falling two games short with a 42\u201330 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals won all four games of a round-robin tournament involving the three playoff teams from the East. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals beat the Celtics in two straight games. In the NBA Finals, the Nationals lost to the Lakers in a hard-fought seven-game series where the two teams alternated wins throughout.\n\nWith the NBA struggling financially and down to just 8 teams during the [[1954\u201355 NBA season|1954\u201355 season]], Nationals owner Biasone suggested the league limit the amount of time taken for a shot thus speeding up a game that often ended with long periods of teams just holding the ball and playing keep away. Biasone and Nationals' general manager Ferris calculated a 24-second shot clock would allow at least 30 shots per quarter speeding up the game and increasing scoring. The Shot Clock was an instant success as scoring was up 14 points per game league-wide. In the first season of the shot clock, the Nationals would take first place in the East with a 43\u201329 record. After a first-round bye the Nationals would beat the Celtics in four games to reach the NBA Finals for the second straight season. In the finals the Nationals would get off to a fast start, led by forward Schayes, taking the first two games at home against the [[Fort Wayne Pistons]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/legends/dolph-schayes/index.html |title=NBA.com: Teams&nbsp;\u2013 Legends profile: Dolph Schayes |website=[[NBA.com]] |access-date=January 29, 2012}}</ref> As the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all three games to take a 3\u20132 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on the Nationals kept Championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109\u2013104 to force a seventh game at home. Game 7 would be as tight as the series as [[George King (basketball, born 1928)|George King]] sank a free throw to give the Nationals a 92\u201391 lead in the final seconds. King then stole the inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals.\n\n[[File:Hal Greer 1969.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Hal Greer]] joined the Nationals in 1958 and spent his entire 15-season career with the franchise; he won a championship with the team in 1967.]]\nComing off their NBA Championship the Nationals struggled during the [[1955\u201356 NBA season|1955\u201356 season]], needing a tiebreaker over the Knickerbockers to avoid finishing in last place and make the playoffs with a 35\u201337 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals stunned the Celtics winning the first-round series in three games by taking the final two games. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals played solid basketball again as they pushed the Warriors to a decisive fifth game. The Nationals' reign as defending champions ended with a 109\u2013104 loss in [[Philadelphia]].\n\nThe Nationals got off to a slow start as coach Cervi was fired and replaced by [[Paul Seymour (basketball)|Paul Seymour]]. Under Seymour, the Nationals rebounded and finished the [[1956\u201357 NBA season|1956\u201357 season]] in second place with a record of 38\u201334. In the playoffs, the Nationals had trouble knocking off the defending champion Warriors advancing to the Eastern Finals with two straight wins. The Nationals were swept in three games by the eventual champions, the Celtics.\n\nFort Wayne and Rochester had moved on to Detroit and Cincinnati for the [[1957\u201358 NBA season|1957\u201358 season]], leaving the Syracuse Nationals as the last small-town team in the big city NBA. That did not matter on the court as the Nationals held their own finishing in second place with a 41\u201331 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals fell in the first round as they lost a three-game series to the Philadelphia Warriors.\n\nDespite a mediocre 35\u201337 record for the [[1958\u201359 NBA season|1958\u201359 season]] the Nationals made the playoffs again by finishing in third place. In the playoffs, the Nationals swept the Knickerbockers in two straight to reach the Eastern Finals, where they lost to the eventual champion Celtics, alternating wins before losing by 5 points in Game 7.\n\nPlaying in a league now dominated by superstars like [[Bill Russell]] of the Celtics, [[Wilt Chamberlain]] of the Warriors, [[Bob Pettit]] of the [[St. Louis Hawks]] and [[Elgin Baylor]] of the Lakers, the Nationals held their own posting a solid 45\u201330 record, while finishing in third place after the 1959\u201360 regular season. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost a three-game series to Chamberlain and the Warriors.\n\nWith the Lakers relocating from [[Minneapolis]] to Los Angeles before the [[1960\u201361 NBA season|1960\u201361 season]], the Syracuse Nationals became the last old NBL team to still be playing in their original city in the NBA. The Nationals went on to make the playoffs again by finishing in third place with a 38\u201341 record. The Nationals were dangerous in the playoffs as they stunned the Warriors in three straight games. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals lost once again to the eventual champion Celtics in five games.\n\nSchayes missed 24 games during the [[1961\u201362 NBA season|1961\u201362 season]] and failed to lead the team in scoring for the first time in 14 years, as Hal Greer led the way with 22.8 points per game. The Nationals finished in third place again with a 41\u201339 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost their first two games to the Warriors on the road. Facing elimination the Nationals won the next two games to force a fifth game in Philadelphia. In Game 5 the Warriors ended the Nationals' season with a 121\u2013104 victory.\n\nWith an aging team, the Nationals were expected to fade; however, with the scrappy play of [[Johnny Kerr]], the Nationals remained a strong contender, finishing in second place for the [[1962\u201363 NBA season|1962\u201363 season]], with a record of 48\u201332. In the playoffs the Nationals faced the [[Cincinnati Royals]], getting off to a 2\u20131 series lead. Needing one win to advance to the Eastern Finals again the Nationals lost two straight, dropping the decisive fifth game at home in overtime 131\u2013127.\n\n===Relocation to Philadelphia===\n[[File:Municipal Auditorium and Convention Hall, 34th Street, below Spruce, Philadelphia, Pa (61770).jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Philadelphia Convention Hall and Civic Center|Convention Hall]], previous home of the [[Golden State Warriors|Philadelphia Warriors]] from 1952 to 1962; home of the Sixers from 1963 to 1967]]\nThe playoff overtime loss on March 26, 1963, would prove to be the last game for the Syracuse Nationals, as investors [[Irv Kosloff]] and [[Ike Richman]] purchased the team from [[Danny Biasone]] and moved the team to Philadelphia, filling the void left by the [[Golden State Warriors|Warriors]], who had moved to San Francisco. Syracuse was the last of the medium-sized cities housing an NBA team, but by then it was apparent that central New York was no longer large enough to support it. The NBA thus returned to Philadelphia one year after the Warriors had left it. A contest was held to decide on a new name for the team. The winning name, chosen by Walter Stalberg, was the \"76ers\".<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Name|url=http://www.nba.com/sixers/history/name.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Sixers.com|date=June 19, 2015|access-date=June 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"76ersHistoricalLook\" /> The name comes from the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in Philadelphia in 1776, although \"Sixers\" was also utilized for shorter referencing.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Rollins |first1=Khadrice |title=Why Are They Called the 76ers? |url=https://www.si.com/nba/2018/05/02/philadelphia-76ers-name-history-where-it-came-from |magazine=Sports Illustrated |access-date=November 21, 2021 |date=May 2, 2018}}</ref> The shorter name was quickly accepted by the team for marketing purposes, and for most of the last half-century \"76ers\" and \"Sixers\" have been officially interchangeable.\n\nFor their first four years in Philadelphia, the 76ers played mostly at the [[Philadelphia Arena]] and [[Philadelphia Civic Center|Civic Center-Convention Hall]], with an occasional game at [[The Palestra]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Schayes was named head coach, a post he held for four years (the first as player-coach).\n\n===1964\u20131967: Wilt Chamberlain era===\n[[File:Wilt Chamberlain 1967.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|Wilt Chamberlain joined the Sixers in 1965 and led the team to the NBA title in 1967.]]\nIn the [[1964\u201365 NBA season|1964\u201365 season]], the 76ers acquired the legendary [[Wilt Chamberlain]] from the Warriors; Chamberlain had been a high school legend at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia and began his career with the Warriors while they still played in Philadelphia. The 76ers would push the Celtics to seven games in the semifinals, with the 76ers trailing 110\u2013109 in Game 7. After [[Hal Greer]]'s pass was stolen by [[John Havlicek]], the Celtics went on to beat the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and win the NBA Championship. On December 3, 1965, in the midst of a game at the Boston Garden, co-owner Richman suffered a heart attack and died courtside.<ref>{{cite web|last=phillyjewishsports.com|title=phillyjewishsports.com|url=http://www.phillyjewishsports.com/viewPillar.asp?ID=3|publisher=phillyjewishsports.com|access-date=October 24, 2012|archive-date=December 9, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209103409/http://www.phillyjewishsports.com/viewPillar.asp?ID=3|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====1966\u201367: First title in Philadelphia====\nLed by head coach [[Alex Hannum]], the 76ers had a dream season as they started 46\u20134,<ref name=\"nba10\">{{cite web|title=NBA at 50: Top 10 Teams|url=https://www.nba.com/history/nba-at-50/top-10-teams|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=November 17, 2017|access-date=April 26, 2020}}</ref> en route to a record of 68\u201313, the best record in league history at the time.<ref name=\"best\">{{cite web |last=Sachare |first=Alex |title=NBA Encyclopedia Playoff Edition: The Best Team Ever |website=[[NBA.com]] |url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/sixers_66-67.html |year=2008}}</ref> Chamberlain, [[Billy Cunningham]], and Greer, along with all-stars [[Chet Walker]], [[Lucious Jackson]] and [[Wali Jones]] led the team to the semifinals. This time the 76ers beat the Celtics in five games. In Game Five of that series, as the 76ers went to victory and the NBA Finals, Philadelphia fans chanted \"Boston is dead!\"\u2014a symbol that the Celts' eight-year reign as NBA champion had ended. [[1967 NBA Finals|The Finals]] were almost anticlimactic, with the Sixers ousting the Warriors in six games to give them their second NBA Championship. The [[1966\u201367 Philadelphia 76ers season|1966\u201367 Sixers]] were voted the best team in league history during the [[NBA 35th Anniversary Team|NBA's 35th anniversary celebration]] in October 1980.\n\n===1967\u20131976: Fall of the 76ers===\nIn the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1967\u201368 season]], with a new home court in the form of [[Spectrum (arena)|The Spectrum]] to defend their championship, once again the 76ers made it back to the NBA Playoffs and in the rematch of the previous year's semifinals, the 76ers held a 3\u20131 series lead over the Celtics, before the Celtics staged a dramatic comeback to beat the Sixers in seven games.\n\nAt the end of the season, the 76ers dealt Chamberlain to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] for Archie Clark, Darrall Imhoff and Jerry Chambers. At the time, the trade appeared to make some sense from the 76ers' perspective. Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the [[American Basketball Association]], and general manager [[Jack Ramsay]] did not want to risk letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing. However Chamberlain\u2019s replacement at center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and was never the same player after that. The Chamberlain trade sent the Sixers into a freefall, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the [[Chicago Bulls]].\n\nWhile the rapidly declining 76ers continued to contend for the next three seasons, they never got past the second round.

This left the Sixers with a roster of Greer and little else. The 76ers lost their first 15 games of the season, and a few months later set a then-record [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|20-game losing streak]] in a single season. Their record following the 20-game losing streak was 4\u201358, and the team at that point had just lost 34 of 35 games. The 76ers finished the season with a 9\u201373 record, leading the skeptical Philadelphia press to call them the \"Nine and 73-ers\". Rubin was fired after 51 games and a 4-47 record; as it turned out, it would be his only NBA coaching job. He was succeeded by player-coach [[Kevin Loughery]], who went 5\u201326 the rest of the way. The 76ers finished an NBA-record 59 games behind the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. Only six years after tallying the most wins in NBA history, the [[1972\u201373 Philadelphia 76ers season|1972\u201373 squad]] notched the fourth-fewest wins in NBA history, and still the fewest for a full 82-game season. The 73 losses, although threatened several times, remains the all-time low-water mark for any NBA franchise. The 76ers' 0.110 winning percentage was a record worst at the time, and would remain the lowest until the [[2011\u201312 Charlotte Bobcats season|2011\u201312 Charlotte Bobcats]] finished 7\u201359 for a .106 winning percentage in a season shortened due to [[2011 NBA lockout|a lockout]]. The 76ers of 1972\u201373 are generally considered to be the worst team ever to take the court in NBA history. In 2007, NBA historian Kyle Wright argued that the [[1992\u201393 Dallas Mavericks season|1992\u201393 Dallas Mavericks]] and [[1997\u201398 Denver Nuggets season|1997\u201398 Denver Nuggets]], both of whom won eleven games, plus [[1970\u201371 Cleveland Cavaliers season|the inaugural Cleveland Cavaliers]], who won 15 games, were actually poorer teams due to much weaker schedules.<ref>See Wright, Kyle; ''The NBA from Top to Bottom: A History of the NBA from the No. 1 Team through No. 1,153''; pp. 73\u201387 {{ISBN|9780595697960}}</ref>\n\nThe next year, the 76ers would hire [[Gene Shue]] as their head coach and they slowly came back. In the [[1975\u201376 NBA season|1975\u201376 season]], the 76ers acquired [[George McGinnis]] from the [[Indiana Pacers]] of the ABA (after the Knicks tried to sign him, not knowing that the 76ers owned his rights). With him, the 76ers were back in the playoffs after a five-year absence, and even though they lost to the [[Buffalo Braves]] in three games, a doctor would come along and get the team healthy enough to stay in perennial contention. During this period, one last personnel misjudgment had effects when the team used the fifth pick overall in the 1975 draft to select [[Darryl Dawkins]] directly from high school. The immensely talented and physically imposing Dawkins seldom, if ever, lived up to his great potential in part because of a perpetual adolescence.\n\n===1976\u20131987: Julius Erving era===\n[[File:JuliusErvingSlamDunk1981.jpg|thumb|upright|220px|Julius Erving played 11 seasons with the 76ers (1976\u20131987), and played in four NBA Finals, ultimately winning in 1983.]]\nThe Sixers finally came all the way back in 1976\u201377, in large part due to the [[ABA\u2013NBA merger]]. The ABA's last champions, the [[New York Nets]], were facing a $5 million to the Knicks for \"invading\" the New York area on top of the $3.2 million expansion fee for joining the NBA. So, when the Sixers offered to buy the contract of the Nets' franchise player, [[Julius Erving]], for $3 million\u2014roughly the cost of NBA membership\u2014the Nets had little choice but to accept. A few months before that trade, Kosloff had sold the Sixers to [[Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr.]] on May 28, 1976.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1976/05/29/archives/motta-to-coach-bullets-76ers-sold-motta-hired-by-bullets-76ers-sold.html Goldaper, Sam. \"Motta to Coach Bullets,\" ''The New York Times'', Saturday, May 29, 1976.] Retrieved December 4, 2020</ref>\n\nLed by Erving, the 76ers began an exciting ride, beating their long-time [[Celtics\u201376ers rivalry|rival]] from Boston in a seven-game playoff series to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. There, they defeated the [[Houston Rockets]], led by future 76er [[Moses Malone]], in six games to advance to the NBA Finals. In the Finals, they sprinted to a 2\u20130 series lead over the [[Bill Walton]]-led [[Portland Trail Blazers]]\u2014who were coached by former 76ers' coach/general manager Jack Ramsay\u2014only to drop the next four games in a row to give the Blazers the title.\n\nThat led to the 1977\u201378 motto of \"We owe you one\", which would ultimately backfire when they lost in the conference finals that season to the [[Washington Bullets]], who went on to win the NBA championship. In the next four seasons, the 76ers would fall short of the NBA Championship, even after Shue handed the coaching reins to former great Billy Cunningham. In the [[1980 NBA Finals]] against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], they lost 4\u20132. In Game Six, rookie [[Magic Johnson]] played center for the Lakers in place of [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] (who was out because of a sprained ankle sustained in Game Five) and scored 42 points. In the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers opened a 3\u20131 series lead over the Celtics only to see Boston come back and win the series in seven games. The following season, the 76ers again faced the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, and again jumped to a 3\u20131 series lead only to see Boston forge a 3\u20133 series tie. The 76ers were given little chance of winning as they faced the Celtics in Game Seven at [[Boston Garden]]. This time, they played angry but inspired basketball, pulling away to a 120\u2013106 victory and becoming the third NBA road team to win [[List of NBA game sevens|Game 7]] after leading the series 3\u20131. In the game's closing moments, the Boston Garden fans began chanting \"Beat L.A., Beat L.A.\", as they realized their team would lose the playoff series to a hated opponent (Philadelphia 76ers), but nonetheless openly wished that opponent good luck in the next round against a more hated opponent (the Los Angeles Lakers).<ref>{{cite news|last=Silva|first=Steve|title=The origins of 'Beat LA'|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=June 2, 2008|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/extras/celtics_blog/2008/06/the_back_beat_b.html|access-date=October 14, 2010|quote=But that's not when the chant took off in Boston.

On his watch, the final piece of the championship puzzle was completed before the [[1982\u201383 NBA season|1982\u201383 season]] when they acquired center [[Moses Malone]] from the [[Houston Rockets]]. Led by [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]rs [[Julius Erving]], [[Maurice Cheeks]], and All-Stars [[Andrew Toney]] and [[Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)|Bobby Jones]], they dominated the regular season, winning 65 games in what is still the second most winning year in franchise history. Malone was named League MVP, and when reporters asked how the playoffs would run, he answered, \"four, four, four\"\u2014in other words, saying that the 76ers needed to win four games in each of the 3 rounds. The media misinterpreted this and assumed Moses was predicting that the 76ers would sweep all three rounds to win the title, with the minimum 12 games.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}} Malone's accent made his boast sound like \"fo', fo', fo'.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}\n\nThe 76ers backed up Malone's boast. They made a mockery of the Eastern Conference playoffs, first sweeping the [[New York Knicks]] and then beating the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in five games. The 76ers went on to win their third NBA championship (and second in Philadelphia) with a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, who had defeated them the season before. Malone was named the playoffs' MVP. The 76ers did not quite fulfill Malone's prediction, as their run was actually \"fo', fi', fo\" (\"four, five, four\") \u2013 a loss to the Bucks in game four of the Eastern finals being the only blemish on their playoff run. Nonetheless, their 12\u20131 playoff record is tied for the fewest losses in league history with the 2000\u201301 Lakers, who went 15\u20131 en route to the NBA title, coincidentally beating the 76ers in the Finals (after suffering their only defeat that postseason in Game 1), and also with the 2016\u20132017 [[Golden State Warriors]], who won the title with a 16\u20131 playoff record. The Philadelphia-based group [[Pieces of a Dream (band)|Pieces Of A Dream]] had a minor hit in 1983 with the R&B song \"Fo-Fi-Fo\", which title was prompted by Malone's quip. This also marked the last major-pro championship in Philadelphia until the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] won the [[2008 World Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=WORLD CHAMPS!; 28 years later, Phillies again are baseball's best|date=October 30, 2008|first=Phil|last=Sheridan|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|page=A1|quote=After 25 years of drought&nbsp;...

As it turned out, they would never again advance as far during Barkley's tenure in Philadelphia. Following the 1984\u201385 season, [[Matt Guokas]] replaced Billy Cunningham as head coach. Guokas led the 76ers to a 54\u201328 record and the second round of the [[1986 NBA playoffs|1986 playoffs]], where they were defeated by the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in seven games.\n\nOn June 16, 1986, Katz made two of the most controversial and highly criticized personnel moves in franchise history, trading Moses Malone to [[Washington Bullets|Washington]] and the first overall pick in the [[1986 NBA draft]] (which had been obtained from the [[San Diego Clippers]] in a 1979 trade for [[Joe Bryant]]) to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. In return, the 76ers received [[Roy Hinson]], [[Jeff Ruland]], and [[Clifford T. Robinson|Cliff Robinson]], none of whom played more than three seasons with the team. Cleveland, meanwhile, turned their acquired pick into future All-Star [[Brad Daugherty (basketball)|Brad Daugherty]].\n\nOn the night of the [[1986\u201387 NBA season|1986\u201387 season]] opener, Julius Erving announced he would retire after the season, which was subsequently filled with tributes in each arena the Sixers visited. On the court, the team suffered through an injury-plagued campaign, but still managed to make the playoffs with a 45\u201337 record. Their season would end at the hands of the Bucks again, this time in a best-of-five first-round series that went the distance.\n\n===1987\u20131992: Charles Barkley era===\n[[File:Barkley Lipofsky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|[[Charles Barkley]] would spend eight seasons with the Sixers.]]\nIn [[1987\u201388 NBA season|1987\u201388]], with the team's record at 20\u201323, Guokas was fired and replaced by assistant coach [[Jim Lynam]]. Lynam finished the season 16\u201323, to bring Philadelphia's overall mark to 36\u201346. For the first time since the [[1974\u201375 NBA season|1974\u201375 season]], the Sixers failed to reach the playoffs. Philadelphia selected [[Charles D. Smith|Charles Smith]] with its first pick (third overall) in the [[1988 NBA draft]], then traded his rights to the Los Angeles Clippers for their first pick (sixth overall), and [[Hersey Hawkins]]. In five seasons with the 76ers, Hawkins would average 19 points per game, and was the team's all-time leader in three-point field goals attempted and made when he was traded to the [[Charlotte Hornets]] for [[Dana Barros]], [[Sidney Green (basketball)|Sidney Green]] and draft picks in 1993.\n\nIn 1988\u201389, Philadelphia returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence, but was swept in the first round by the [[New York Knicks]]. In 1989\u201390, Barkley finished second in the league's MVP voting, as the Sixers won the Atlantic Division title with a 53\u201329 record. After defeating Cleveland in the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] in the second round. The 76ers fell to the Chicago Bulls in five games, and would do the same in [[1991 NBA playoffs|1991]] after sweeping the Bucks in the first round. In the [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392 season]], the 76ers went 35\u201347 and missed the playoffs for just the second time during Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia. On June 17, 1992, Barkley was traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for [[Jeff Hornacek]], [[Tim Perry]], and [[Andrew Lang (basketball)|Andrew Lang]], a deal that was met with harsh criticism.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/2001/02/22/sayitaintso_sixers/ |title=CNNSI.com \u2013 NBA Basketball \u2013 Say It Ain't So: Philadelphia 76ers |magazine=Sports Illustrated|access-date=March 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1992\u20131996: Dark ages===\nLynam relinquished his head coaching position to become general manager following the 1991\u201392 season, and hired [[Doug Moe]] to fill the vacancy. Moe's tenure lasted just 56 games, with the Sixers posting a 19\u201337 record. Popular former player and longtime assistant coach [[Fred Carter]] succeeded Moe as head coach in March 1993, but could only manage a 32\u201376 record at the helm. Following the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]], the 76ers hired [[John Harding Lucas II|John Lucas]] in the dual role of head coach and general manager. The enthusiastic Lucas had been successful as a head coach for the [[San Antonio Spurs]], and Philadelphia hoped he could breathe new life into the 76ers. It proved disastrous, as the team went 42\u2013122 in its two seasons under Lucas. The acquisition of unproductive free agents such as [[Scott Williams (basketball player)|Scott Williams]] and [[Charles Shackleford]], players at the end of their careers such as [[LaSalle Thompson]], [[Orlando Woolridge]], and [[Scott Skiles]] along with stunningly unwise high draft picks such as [[Shawn Bradley]] and [[Sharone Wright]] were also factors in the team's decline. In fact, Wright would only play four seasons in the NBA while Temple product [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]]\u2014drafted 4 slots below Wright in 1994 by the L.A. Lakers\u2014had 16 productive seasons as an NBA player.\n\n[[File:Ed Snider 2014.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Ed Snider]] purchased the 76ers in 1996.]]\nStarting with the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]], and ending with the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]], the 76ers had the dubious distinction of seeing their win total decrease each year. The nadir was the 1995\u201396 season, when they finished with an 18\u201364 record, the second-worst in franchise history at the time. It was also the second-worst record in the league that year, ahead of only the expansion [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver Grizzlies]] but behind the [[Toronto Raptors]], who were also in their inaugural season. That season would turn out to be their last in [[Spectrum (arena)|The Spectrum]]. Katz, unpopular among fans since the 1986 trades, sold the team to [[Comcast Spectacor]], a consortium of [[Philadelphia Flyers]] owner [[Ed Snider]] and [[Comcast Corporation]], at the end of the 1995\u201396 season. Snider had been the 76ers' landlord since gaining control of the Spectrum in 1971. [[Pat Croce]], a former trainer for the Flyers and Sixers, took over as president.\n\nMany 76ers fans call these years \"The Dark Ages\". After many years of misfortune, there was a bright spot. The team won the lottery for the top pick in the [[1996 NBA draft]]. Questions remained, but with the first pick, the Sixers found their \"Answer\": [[Allen Iverson]].\n\n===1996\u20132006: Allen Iverson era===\n{{See also|List of career achievements by Allen Iverson}}\nWith new ownership, Iverson in place, and the 76ers moving into the [[CoreStates Center]], things seemed to finally be heading in a positive direction. Croce fired Lucas as both coach and general manager. [[Johnny Davis (basketball, born 1955)|Johnny Davis]] was named head coach, while Brad Greenberg took over as general manager. Iverson was named Rookie of the Year, but Philadelphia's overall improvement was minimal, as they finished with a 22\u201360 record. Changes had to be made, and after the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], Davis and Greenberg were both fired and the unveiling of a new 76ers team logo and jerseys marked a new era. To replace Davis, [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] was hired as head coach. Known for a defense-first approach and transforming unsuccessful teams into winners by \"playing the right way\", Brown faced perhaps his toughest coaching challenge. He often clashed with Iverson, but the 76ers improved to 31 wins in 1997\u201398. Early in the [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]], the Sixers traded [[Jerry Stackhouse]], who had been the third overall pick in the [[1995 NBA draft]], to the [[Detroit Pistons]]. In exchange, Philadelphia received [[Aaron McKie]] and [[Theo Ratliff]], defensive standouts who would have an impact in the team's resurgence. Another key figure in the team's rise, [[Eric Snow]], was added in a trade with the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in January 1998.\n\nPrior to the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]], the 76ers signed [[George Lynch (basketball)|George Lynch]] and [[Matt Geiger]], but a lockout delayed the start of the season, which was shortened to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired [[Tyrone Hill]] in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this lockout-shortened season, finishing with a 28\u201322 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the [[Orlando Magic]] 3\u20131, before being swept by the [[Indiana Pacers]]. The following season, the Sixers improved to 49\u201333, fifth in the Eastern Conference. Again, the Sixers won their first-round series in four games, this time defeating the [[Charlotte Hornets]]. For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. Though the team was moving in a positive direction, Iverson and Brown continued to clash, and their relationship deteriorated to the point where it seemed certain Iverson would be traded. A rumored trade to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] fell through, but a complicated four-team deal that would've seen Iverson sent to Detroit was agreed upon, only to see it dissolve due to salary cap problems. When it became clear Iverson was staying in Philadelphia, he and Brown worked to patch things up, and the team would reap the benefits in 2000\u201301.\n\n====2000\u201301 season: NBA Finals loss to the Lakers====\n[[File:Allen Iverson Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|left|220px|upright|Iverson won Most Valuable Player honors in 2001 while leading the 76ers to the NBA Finals.]]\nDuring the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301 season]], the 76ers got off to a hot start by winning their first ten games and were never seriously challenged in the Atlantic Division. Larry Brown coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars, and Allen Iverson was named MVP of the All-Star Game. Shortly before the All-Star break, Theo Ratliff was lost for the season with a wrist injury, one that would later prove to be devastating to his future career. Despite holding a 41\u201314 record and a comfortable lead atop both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference standings at the time of the February 22 trade deadline, management felt the team needed an established center to advance deep into the playoffs. On that day, Philadelphia acquired [[Dikembe Mutombo]] from the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in a deal that sent the injured Ratliff along with [[Nazr Mohammed]], [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], and [[Pepe S\u00e1nchez]] to Atlanta (S\u00e1nchez was reacquired later in the season after the Hawks waived him). The 76ers went on to finish 56\u201326, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989\u201390 and top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Indiana yet again. In Game One, the 76ers wasted an 18-point lead and lost, 79\u201378, when [[Reggie Miller]] hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds. Philadelphia fought back and won the next three games to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Sixers squared off against the Toronto Raptors and their superstar, [[Vince Carter]]. The teams alternated wins in the first four games, with Iverson scoring 54 points in Philadelphia's Game Two victory. A Game Five win (with Iverson scoring 52 in a 121\u201388 rout) and Game Six loss set up a decisive Game Seven, which the 76ers survived as Carter missed a long jump shot at the buzzer for an 88\u201387 victory that sent the Sixers to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. After the teams split the first two games of the series in Philadelphia, it was learned Iverson would miss Game Three due to various nagging injuries that had plagued him late in the season. Though most predicted a Milwaukee cakewalk, the 76ers kept the game close before falling, 80\u201374. Philadelphia seemed to gain momentum despite the loss, and they would win Games Four and Five. Milwaukee put any Sixer celebration plans on hold by building up a 33-point lead in the third quarter of Game Six, but the 76ers would make a furious fourth-quarter rally before falling 110\u2013100. Struggling in the series up to that point, Iverson scored 26 points in the final quarter to finish with 46 on the night and appeared to have gotten a second wind. In Game Seven, the Bucks jumped out to a 34\u201325 second-quarter advantage before seldom-used reserve [[Raja Bell]] scored 10 points to spark a 23\u20134 run that gave Philadelphia the lead for good. Iverson scored 44 points and the 76ers pulled away in the second half, winning by a 108\u201391 score to put them in the NBA Finals for the first time since 1983. As had been the case in their three previous Finals appearances, their opponent would be the Los Angeles Lakers, who had run up an 11\u20130 record in the first three rounds of the playoffs and were expected by many to make quick work of a worn-down 76ers squad. Because of a seemingly meaningless loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls in the regular season finale (both the Sixers and the Lakers finished with identical 56\u201326 records, but Los Angeles was awarded a higher seed based on tiebreakers), the NBA Finals marked the first time in the 2001 playoffs in which the 76ers had to start a series on the road.\n\n[[File:Larry Brown 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Larry Brown, who coached the 76ers from 1997 to 2003, was named Coach of the Year in 2001.]]\nIn Game 1, the Lakers jumped out to an 18\u20135 lead, but the 76ers stormed back to take a 15-point lead in the second half. Los Angeles rallied to force a 94\u201394 tie at the end of regulation before scoring the first five points of the overtime period, but the 76ers closed the game on a 13\u20132 run for a 107\u2013101 triumph. Iverson hit a go-ahead three-pointer with 1:19 to go in the extra period, and followed that with a jump shot after which he infamously stepped over [[Tyronn Lue]] after making the basket. [[Eric Snow]] hit a running jump shot in the waning seconds with the shot clock expiring to clinch the stunning victory. The series would come back to Philadelphia even as Los Angeles took Game Two, 98\u201389. In Game Three, [[Shaquille O'Neal]] fouled out late in the fourth quarter, and the Sixers pulled to within a point with less than a minute to play after trailing by 12 earlier in the second half. [[Robert Horry]] hit a clutch three-pointer in that final minute, and the Lakers prevailed, 96\u201391. Los Angeles wrapped up the second of what would be three consecutive NBA titles with a 100\u201386 win in Game Four and a 108\u201396 victory in Game Five.\n\nIn addition to their Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference titles, the [[2000\u201301 Philadelphia 76ers season|2000\u201301 76ers]] featured the NBA's MVP (Iverson), Coach of the Year (Brown), Defensive Player of the Year (Mutombo), and Sixth Man of the Year ([[Aaron McKie]]).\n\n====Departure of Larry Brown====\nThe 76ers went into the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]] with high expectations, but were able to produce only a 43\u201339 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia was defeated 3\u20132 by the Boston Celtics. In the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]], the 76ers sprinted to a 15\u20134 start, but a 10\u201320 swoon left them 25\u201324 at the All-Star break. After the break, the 76ers caught fire, winning nine in a row at one point, and 23 of their last 33 to finish at 48\u201334, earning the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Iverson scored 55 points in the playoff opener against the New Orleans Hornets and the Sixers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round, the Detroit Pistons ended Philadelphia's playoff run in a frustrating six-game series that saw the 76ers lose twice in overtime, and once on a last-second shot in regulation. It would be nine years before the Sixers won another playoff series.\n\nOn Memorial Day, 2003, Brown abruptly resigned as head coach, taking over the reins in Detroit a few days later. Brown's Pistons would win the [[2004 NBA Finals|2004 NBA Championship]] over the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], in some ways avenging his loss to them in 2001. After being turned down by [[Jeff Van Gundy]] and [[Eddie Jordan (basketball)|Eddie Jordan]], the 76ers hired [[Randy Ayers]], an assistant coach under Brown, as their new head coach. Ayers lasted only 52 games and was fired with the team's record at 21\u201331. [[Chris Ford]] took over, but the 76ers finished the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]] at 33\u201349, missing the playoffs for the first time in six years. Iverson, who was at odds with Ford throughout the interim coach's tenure, played only 48 games in a stormy, injury-plagued season.\n\n====Arrival of Andre Iguodala====\n[[File:Andre dunks.jpg|thumb|220px|Andre Iguodala was drafted by the 76ers in 2004]]\nFor the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]], Philadelphia native [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1952)|Jim O'Brien]] was named head coach. Iverson was moved back to point guard and flourished, having arguably his finest season. He also impressed many with his willingness to get other players involved in the offense. During this season, Philadelphia acquired [[Chris Webber]] in a trade with the [[Sacramento Kings]], with the hopes that the team had at long last found a consistent second scoring option to complement Iverson. [[Andre Iguodala]], Philadelphia's first-round pick in the [[2004 NBA draft]], was named to the All-Rookie First Team, and the 76ers returned to the [[2005 NBA playoffs|postseason]] with a 43\u201339 record. In the first round, they were defeated in five games by the defending NBA Champion Pistons, coached by Larry Brown.\n\nThough in the 2004\u201305 season the 76ers exceeded many on-court expectations, there was a great deal of behind-the-scenes tension between O'Brien, his players, and the front office. Shortly after the season ended, O'Brien was fired and replaced by the popular [[Maurice Cheeks]], who played for the team from 1978 to 1989, and was the starting point guard for the 1983 NBA Champions. The coaching change did not help the team's fortunes for the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]]. A 2\u201310 stretch in March doomed them to missing the playoffs for the second time in three years with a 38\u201344 record.\n\nWith the opening of the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]], the 76ers started out hot, going 3\u20130 for the first time since making it to the Finals five years previously. They stumbled through the first half of the season and did not recover, finishing 35\u201347, good for third in the Atlantic Division, and ninth in the Eastern Conference (tied with Indiana).\n\nOn December 5, 2006, disappointed with the direction the team was headed, Allen Iverson gave the 76ers management an ultimatum: ''find players who will help support me or trade me.'' This was confirmed via an in-game interview with team owner, [[Ed Snider]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/10/AR2006121000537_pf.html | newspaper=The Washington Post | title=Iverson's Destination Remains Unknown | first=Dan | last=Gelston | access-date=May 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===2006\u20132011: Post-Iverson era===\n{{Overly detailed|section|details=This section is excessive detailed in comparison to sections of this article of equal, or more, importance|date=December 2021}}\nOn December 19, 2006, [[Allen Iverson]], along with [[Ivan McFarlin]], were sent to the [[Denver Nuggets]] in exchange for guard [[Andre Miller]], forward [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]], and two first-round draft picks.

The Sixers would pay Webber $36 million over the next 1\u00bd seasons, which is $7 million less than he would have been paid to play. After the buyout, the Sixers waived Webber, making him a free agent. Webber signed with the [[Detroit Pistons]] shortly thereafter. The moves allowed the 76ers to make Iguodala the unquestioned leader of the team, and evaluate whether they saw him as a franchise player. They finished the year 35\u201347.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| total_width = 350\n| footer = \n| footer_align = centre\n| caption_align = center\n| image1 = Thaddeus Young vs NIck Young.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Thaddeus Young]] was the 76ers' first draft pick in the post-Iverson era.\n| image2 = Elton Brand 10.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Elton Brand]] signed for five years with the Sixers in 2008.\n}}\n\nIn 2007, the Sixers drafted small forward [[Thaddeus Young]] with the 12th pick.

The white home uniform, on the other hand, featured some subtle changes. While the letters were in black with red trim, the \"Sixers\" logo was initially gold, but in 2000, the color was changed as black. Also in 2000, the black background and red outline within the \"Sixers\" logo were removed. A blue alternate uniform was introduced in the same year, with the letters in white with red trim; the arm piping was removed after only one season.

As with the other uniforms, the \"PHILA\" wordmark was shaped similarly to the team logo, with the silver star atop the \"I\". White numbers with black trim were placed on this uniform, along with a silver star on the neckline and blue and white striping.

The 1966\u201367 Sixers, voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary, set a then-record by winning 68 games in the 81-game season (a record since broken by the Lakers, Bulls and Warriors) and ending Boston's eight-year title reign which led to the infamous \"Boston's Dead!\" chants.\n\nThe 76ers went through a rebuilding period through the early 1970s, and came back to relevance during the [[1976\u201377 NBA season|1976\u201377 season]], in which they defeated the Celtics en route to a Finals appearance. Both teams would peak in the 1980s, with every single Eastern Conference Championship between 1980 and 1987 belonging to either the 76ers or Celtics. The Larry Bird-led Celtics won five of them, while the Julius Erving-led 76ers won the other three. The Charles Barkley-led Sixers of the later 1980s took the fight to the Celtics; neither team experienced much playoff success in the late 1980s, and both took steep nosedives in the Eastern Conference rankings throughout the 1990s.\n\nThe rivalry was reborn in the 2000s. The first time, the Allen Iverson-led defending-Eastern Conference champions 76ers were defeated in the first round of the 2002 playoffs by the Paul Pierce-led Celtics 3\u20132. The second time, exactly ten years later, the Big Three Celtics (Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen) defeated the valiant eight seed 76ers team 4\u20133. In the ten years in between, the Sixers would experience limited success whereas the Celtics won a championship and contended for most of that span. In a memorable 2006 regular season meeting between the two, the 76ers defeated the Celtics 125\u2013124 in triple overtime, with Iverson leading the way with 33 points and 10 assists.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n''List of the last five seasons completed by the 76ers.
