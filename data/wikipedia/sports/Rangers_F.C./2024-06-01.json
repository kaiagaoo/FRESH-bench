Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s and then once more in 2020 to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo. The scroll crest first appeared on the teams shorts for the start of the 1978\u201379 season.<ref name=\"Rangers Crest Badges\">{{cite web|url=http://www.danburymint.co.uk/index.php?act=product&product_id=4250&cat_id=&mediacode=&kiks_code=|title=The Badges of Rangers Football Club|publisher=Danbury Mint|access-date=21 January 2013|quote=The earliest badge featured the celebrated RFC scroll crest believed to have been used since 1872.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|access-date=17 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archive-date=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|access-date=24 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archive-date=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018\u20132019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|access-date=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref> and reintroduced in 2018\u201319<ref name=\"2018\u201319 kits\" /> and 2022\u201323,<ref name=\"Rangers 22-23 Third Kit Released\">{{cite news|title=Rangers 22-23 Third Kit Released|work=footyheadlines.com|publisher=Footy Headlines|accessdate=19 May 2022|url=https://www.footyheadlines.com/2022/05/rangers-22-23-third-kit-released.html|date=10 May 2022}}</ref> have caused controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name=\"2018\u201319 kits\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.
