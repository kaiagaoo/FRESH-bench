It was founded in 1970 (as PP Sauber AG) by [[Peter Sauber]], who progressed through [[hillclimbing]] and the [[World Sportscar Championship]] to reach [[Formula One]] in {{F1|1993}}. After operating it under their own name from {{F1|1993}} until {{F1|2018}}, Sauber Motorsport AG renamed their Formula One racing team to [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo Racing]].\n\nHaving not won a Grand Prix as an independent, the team was sold to [[BMW]] in 2005 and competed as BMW Sauber from 2006 to 2009, finishing third in 2007 and second in 2008 in the Constructors' Championship, and scoring their lone grand prix victory at the [[2008 Canadian Grand Prix]]. At the end of a less successful 2009 season, BMW pulled out of Formula One and the team's future remained uncertain for several months until it was sold back to Peter Sauber and granted a 2010 entry. Due to issues with the [[Concorde Agreement]], the team remained as \"BMW Sauber\" for the 2010 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/81145|title=BMW Sauber to retain name for now|authors=Elizalde, Pablo; Noble, Jonathan|date=31 January 2010|work=autosport.com|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|access-date=31 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/f1releases/2010/Pages/f1_2010_entry.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316035548/http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/f1releases/2010/Pages/f1_2010_entry.aspx|archive-date=16 March 2010|title=FIA Formula One World Championship&nbsp;\u2013 Entry List |work=fia.com|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]]|date=3 March 2010|access-date=3 March 2010}}</ref> In March 2010, Peter Sauber announced plans to change the team name during the season but the FIA announced that they would have to wait until the end of the season to change their name.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sauber poised to request name change|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/82181|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|work=autosport.com|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=16 March 2010|access-date=17 March 2010}}</ref> At the beginning of the {{F1|2011}} season, the team dropped BMW from their name.\n\nUntil mid-2016, Peter Sauber held a controlling 66.6% stake in the team, with the remainder belonging to then CEO [[Monisha Kaltenborn]]; she had been a leading figure in the team since BMW's withdrawal.<ref name=kaltenbornstake>{{cite news|last=Elizalde|first=Pablo|title=Peter Sauber transfers third of Group Sauber stake to CEO Monisha Kaltenborn|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|work=autosport.com|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/99641|date=16 May 2012|access-date=16 May 2012}}</ref> The team was sold during the 2016 season to Swiss investment firm Longbow Finance S.A, with Pascal Picci taking over Peter Sauber's role as chairman of the board and president.<ref name=\"Longbow\">{{cite news|title=Sauber F1 team announces change of ownership|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/sauber-f1-team-announces-change-of-ownership-800401/|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|work=[[Motorsport.com]]|publisher=Motorsport Network|date=20 July 2016|access-date=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nSauber is set to be the works F1 team for [[Audi in Formula One|Audi]] for the 2026 season onwards.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Audi partners with Swiss Sauber for Formula One |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/audi-partners-swiss-sauber-formula-one-3026281 |access-date=2022-10-26 |website=CNA |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Sports cars==\n[[Peter Sauber]] began building [[sports car]]s in the 1970s. After using turbocharged Mercedes V8 engines in the 1980s, his team became the official factory team of Mercedes-Benz, reviving the [[Silver Arrows|Silver Arrow]] legend. They won the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] and the [[World Sports Prototype Championship]] ([[1989 World Sportscar Championship season|1989]] and [[1990 World Sportscar Championship season|1990]] respectively), competing against [[Jaguar Cars#Motorsport|Jaguar]] and [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]].

The 1.5-litre turbocharged engines were phased out in favour of naturally aspirated 3.5-litre engines. Massive demand for engine suppliers and a constant influx of new teams saw car manufacturers like [[Subaru]], [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]] and [[Lamborghini]] enter Formula One as engine suppliers and sometimes buying out existing teams. Other projects never progressed beyond design studies, such as one carried out by [[Simtek]] for BMW. It was a turbulent time that led to the withdrawal of many small teams and even more famous marques such as [[Brabham]] and [[Team Lotus|Lotus]].\n\nA planned [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] collaboration with Sauber to enter their own Formula One team was shelved, although behind closed doors Mercedes continued to fund Sauber's Formula One project. The team was to be powered by V10 [[Ilmor]] engines in a chassis dubbed the C12, a continuation of Sauber's naming policy from sports car construction (the 'C' was a reference to Peter Sauber's wife Christine). It was to be driven by [[JJ Lehto]] and [[Karl Wendlinger]].\n\n[[File:Karl Wendlinger - Sauber C12 during practice for the 1993 British Grand Prix (33302730550).jpg|thumb|left|The Sauber team's first Formula One car, the [[Sauber C12]].]]\n[[File:Sauber \"S\" logo 2000's.gif|thumb|left|The traditional Sauber \"S\" logo which has evolved through different sponsors over the years.]]\n\nThe car's racing debut took place in the first race of {{F1|1993}}, in South Africa. The car was soon turning heads not only for its sharp [[Williams FW14|FW14]]-like lines and striking black livery but its impressive performance, claiming fifth place (two points under the scoring system at the time) on its Grand Prix debut. Despite this impressive entrance to the Grand Prix scene, over the remainder of the season the team rarely saw the finish line due to unreliability and racing accidents. However, they proved their form was not a flash in the pan recording a slow stream of points finishes and rarely finishing outside the top ten when they actually completed a race distance. Despite not achieving a podium, they ended the season with twelve points, seventh out of the thirteen original entries.\n\nThe team went into the 1994 season as Sauber Mercedes, now officially Mercedes's [[factory-backed]] team with a new car in the Sauber C13 and the Ilmor engine rebadged the Mercedes 3.5 V10. New team [[Pacific Racing|Pacific Grand Prix Ltd]] took a customer supply of more dated Ilmor units. Between seasons Lehto had signed to [[Benetton Formula|Mild Seven Benetton Ford]]. Former Sauber sports car driver [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] took up the role as Karl Wendlinger's teammate.\n\nEarly signs showed the team was, rather disappointingly, delivering similar performances to the previous year, scoring a small tally of points in the opening rounds. The season took a turn for the worse after a fourth place by Wendlinger following the tragic deaths of [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Roland Ratzenberger]] at the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]]. Just two weeks later, Wendlinger was seriously injured after crashing in practice for the [[1994 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]]; losing control of his car under braking for the Nouvelle Chicane. He suffered serious head injuries which left him in a coma for weeks and he was sidelined for the rest of the season. He was replaced by [[Andrea de Cesaris]] and a returning Lehto who had been replaced at Benetton after injury complications.\n\nThe Wendlinger accident was a pivotal moment in Formula One history. Together with the [[death of Ayrton Senna]], it later prompted the mandatory implementation of head protection for drivers in the form of high cockpit sides. Sauber voluntarily pioneered prototypes of these to protect their drivers.\n\nThey would finish the season with the same points tally as the previous year but finished only eighth out of the fourteen original entrants. Mercedes was dissatisfied with the progress and left the team at the end of the year, enticed by an offer from the [[McLaren]] team which was still looking for a new works deal since Honda withdrew from the sport and an also-disappointing partnership with Peugeot (whose engines went to [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]]). The partnership would see Team McLaren Mercedes take their first win in 1997 and both titles in 1998 but left Sauber to pick up the works Ford engine deal from Benetton.\n\n====Red Bull alliance and Ford engines (1995\u20131996)====\n[[File:Heinz-Harald Frentzen 1995 Britain.jpg|thumb|right|Frentzen driving for Sauber at the [[1995 British Grand Prix]].]]\n\nThe 1995 season and Sauber C14 marked the beginning of a ten-year sponsorship deal with energy drink giant [[Red Bull]]. Entrepreneur [[Dietrich Mateschitz]] had purchased a majority share in the team and [[Fritz Kaiser]] joined as commercial director.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sponsors: Red Bull|publisher=Inside F1|work=grandprix.com|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/spon-032.html|access-date=31 January 2010}}</ref> They landed a factory supply of Ford [[Cosworth#ECA|ECA Zetec-R]] V8 engines. The 1995 season saw the return of Karl Wendlinger partnering Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Unfortunately, the Austrian's serious accident in 1994 seemed to have taken a lot out of his driving potential and he was replaced after two races by rookie [[Jean-Christophe Boullion]].\n\nThe season, for Frentzen at least, went surprisingly well. The team finished with a record eighteen points despite the underperforming Ford engine and Jean-Christophe Boullion, who was again dropped, allowing Wendlinger to make his final Formula One appearance. They also climbed back up to seventh in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n1995 also saw [[Petronas]] become Sauber's presenting sponsor. They renewed their association in 2006, by which time the team had changed ownership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f1network.net/main/s200/st85906.htm|title=PETRONAS to be Premium Partner of BMW Sauber F1|publisher=www.f1network.com|date=27 November 2005}}</ref>\n\n1996 saw Sauber's worst Formula One season in terms of points despite a promising driver line-up in Heinz-Harald Frentzen and [[Johnny Herbert]], a revised C15 and the new V10 [[Cosworth#JD|Cosworth JD]] engine. Despite again holding seventh spot on a shrinking list of constructors, they only scored 11 points and had not impressed for much of the season. For the next season they announced a customer deal to receive Ferrari V10 engines while they worked with new sponsors Petronas to construct their own engines. Unfortunately, due to [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|a major economic crash in Asia]] the engines were never completed.\n\n====Sauber-Petronas Engineering (1997\u20132005)====\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2005 Canada 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jacques Villeneuve]] driving for the Sauber team at the [[2005 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\nSauber used Ferrari designed customer engines (from 1997 to 2005) and gearboxes built by [[Sauber Petronas Engineering]], a company founded for the sole purpose of building these engines, that were nearly identical to the ones used by Ferrari as Sauber was relegated to being a customer team after four years as an independent works partner team. Sauber licensed nearly every legally licensable part from Ferrari and even had several Ferrari engineers on staff. Many pointed out suspicious similarities between Ferrari and Sauber chassis, but no formal accusations were ever made ([[FIA]] rules required each team to design their own chassis).\n\nIn 2001, Sauber brought a virtually unknown and very inexperienced [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] into Formula One, despite the protests of a few drivers and influential members of the FIA, including [[Max Mosley]], that he would pose a danger to other drivers. His performances that year, however, more than vindicated their decision (he would later go on to win the 2007 Drivers' Championship with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]). It also caused [[Red Bull]] to sell their majority share in the team to [[Credit Suisse]] in protest (Red Bull wanted [[Enrique Bernoldi]] to take the seat but he wound up at [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]]). In 2004, Sauber spent a large sum of money on a new [[wind tunnel]] at [[Hinwil]], and a high performance [[supercomputer]] (called ''Albert'') to help refine the aerodynamics of their cars. The state-of-the-art infrastructure Sauber has built up is one aspect that attracted [[BMW Motorsport]] to Sauber.\n\nIn its later years, Sauber's links with Ferrari became weaker. They sided with the non-Ferrari teams over planned rule changes at the end of the 2004 season and also joined up with the [[GPWC]]. Then they decided to switch to [[Michelin]] tyres, while Ferrari continued to use [[Bridgestone]] tyres. Meanwhile, beverage company Red Bull left Sauber in 2005 as they bought their own team, [[Red Bull Racing]]. BMW ownership commenced from 1 January 2006 with BMW having bought Credit Suisse's share in the team. Sauber's final Grand Prix before BMW takeover was the [[2005 Chinese Grand Prix]], with Massa scoring a welcome sixth place to round off the team's history. Sauber had finished its independent run in F1 with six third places and two front-row starts being their best results. Amongst notable Sauber drivers were [[Jean Alesi]], 2008 Drivers' Championship runner-up [[Felipe Massa]], [[Johnny Herbert]], and 1997 World Champion [[Jacques Villeneuve]]. Two former Sauber drivers drove for the new [[BMW Sauber]] team in 2006: [[Nick Heidfeld]] who was a Sauber driver from 2001 to 2003, and Villeneuve who drove for the team in 2005.\n\n===BMW factory team (2006\u20132009)===\n{{See also|BMW in Formula One}}\n[[File:Nick Heidfeld Hungaroring.jpg|thumb|[[Nick Heidfeld]] took BMW's first podium finish at the [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix]].]]\n[[File:Thanks Michael 2006 Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|BMW Sauber put \"Thanks Michael\" messages on the back of their cars for what was then [[Michael Schumacher]]'s last Grand Prix in [[2006 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]].]]\n\nAt the end of the {{F1|2005}} season, the team's majority shareholding previously owned by [[Credit Suisse]] was bought by [[BMW]], with Peter Sauber retaining a 20% stake, and was renamed ''BMW Sauber''. BMW sold its part back to Peter Sauber after the end of the {{F1|2009}} season, but the team formally used the name ''BMW Sauber'' until the end of the {{F1|2010}} season. The team held a [[List of Formula One constructors#Team's nationality|German licence]] from {{F1|2006}} to {{F1|2009}}, then reverted to a Swiss licence in {{F1|2010}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/f1releases/2010/Pages/f1_2010_entry.aspx|title=2010 Formula One World Championship Entry list|work=fia.com |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] |date=3 March 2010 |access-date=31 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302060256/http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/f1releases/2010/Pages/f1_2010_entry.aspx |archive-date=2 March 2012 |url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n====2006====\nFor the {{F1|2006}} season the team re-signed Nick Heidfeld from [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] to be their lead driver (Heidfeld drove for Sauber in 2001\u20132003), while 1997 World Champion [[Jacques Villeneuve]] had his existing Sauber contract confirmed. Pole [[Robert Kubica]] was signed as the team's [[third driver]]. The team continued to use Sauber's facilities, mostly for chassis construction and wind tunnel testing, while BMW's headquarters in Munich were responsible for building the new P86 V8 engine.\n\nFormer Sauber title sponsor [[Petronas]] renewed their contract with the new team after BMW Sauber snubbed [[BP]]-[[Castrol]], despite them being BMW's official commercial gasoline and motor oil partner. [[Credit Suisse]] also continued their sponsorship.

Heidfeld continued this success with two more fourth places in Malaysia and Bahrain respectively. Kubica finished sixth in Bahrain after retiring in Australia and mechanical trouble in Malaysia.\n\nTheir performance thus far had been such that many were saying a race win was likely after firmly establishing themselves as the best team behind championship leaders [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[McLaren]].

Team principal Mario Theissen targeted the team's first Formula 1 victory for 2008.\n\nBMW Sauber started the season well with Kubica narrowly missing out on pole after a mistake in his main qualifying lap in [[2008 Australian Grand Prix|Melbourne]]. He later retired after being hit by [[Kazuki Nakajima]] but Heidfeld finished second. Kubica took second in [[2008 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]], with Heidfeld in sixth setting the fastest lap of the race. The team's points total of 11 was their largest score up to that time. In [[2008 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]], Kubica scored his and the team's first ever pole position, beating [[Felipe Massa]] by just under three hundredths of a second. The team went on to finish third and fourth in the race, equalling their highest round points total and promoting them to first place in the Constructors' Championship for the first time.\n\nThe team also attained a second-place finish in the [[2008 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] with Robert Kubica, beating both Ferraris and only trailing the [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]] of [[Lewis Hamilton]] by three seconds.\n\nBMW Sauber's first race victory came in the [[2008 Canadian Grand Prix]], the team achieving a one-two finish with Robert Kubica's first race win and Nick Heidfeld taking second place. The victory came after Lewis Hamilton collided with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen in the pitlane, ending the race for both drivers. Kubica was on a different refuelling strategy from Heidfeld, who also briefly led the race before securing the one-two finish for BMW Sauber in comfortable fashion. This was the first Formula One victory for a BMW engine since the [[2004 Brazilian Grand Prix]].\n\nAfter the team's breakthrough win, development was switched to the 2009 season where new regulations come into play. This greatly annoyed Kubica, (who was leading the championship after the Canadian Grand Prix), as he felt they could have had a realistic chance of taking at least one title. The lack of development was reflected with a drop of form throughout the second half of the season, causing BMW to be outpaced by Renault, Toyota and even Toro Rosso (who started the season as one of the slowest teams) by the end of the season. Despite this, Kubica remained with an outside chance of taking the Drivers' Championship until the [[2008 Chinese Grand Prix|Chinese Grand Prix]], the 17th round out of 18.\n\n====2009====\n[[File:Heidfeld 2009 Malaysian GP 2.jpg|thumb|right|In a disappointing final year for BMW, Nick Heidfeld took the first of the team's two podiums during the season at the [[2009 Malaysian Grand Prix]].]]\n\nIn October 2008, the team confirmed that they would stick with Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld as their drivers for the {{F1|2009}} season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7654412.stm|title=Kubica and Heidfeld stay with BMW|work=BBC Sport  |publisher=BBC  |date=6 October 2008|access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough BMW Sauber targeted the {{F1|2009}} season as the year they would challenge for the title, their start to the season was a disappointment. Kubica was in third place in the [[2009 Australian Grand Prix|opening round]], when he collided with Vettel while battling for second place and was forced to retire. Heidfeld then secured the team's first podium of the year in [[2009 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]], but after six races BMW Sauber had collected a mere six points, and occupied eighth place in the Constructors' Championship out of ten teams. A raft of upgrades were set for [[2009 Turkish Grand Prix|Turkey]], including an improved [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] system (KERS) and a double deck diffuser. While the new diffuser was implemented, the KERS could not be made to fit the new car and both drivers raced without the device. After the qualifying session for the [[2009 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] Mario Theissen announced that the team had decided to halt further development of KERS; of which BMW had been one of the strongest proponents, and focus instead on improving the car's aerodynamics. This left Ferrari and McLaren as the only remaining users of the KERS system. In the [[2009 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]] at Valencia, Kubica scored the team's first points since the race in Turkey.\n\nFollowing a meeting of the BMW board on 28 July, the company held a press conference the following morning in which it confirmed the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the end of 2009.

In the last few laps of the race, Kobayashi overtook the [[Ferrari]] of [[Fernando Alonso]] and the [[Toro Rosso]] of [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]] for a seventh-place finish. The impressive drive from Kobayashi received much acclaim and was Sauber's best result of the season to-date. Pedro de la Rosa meanwhile, despite originally crossing the line in tenth position to secure 1 point, was relegated to 12th place after a penalty, stripping away a double points finish. Both drivers went on to score points at the {{F1 GP|2010|Japanese}} and {{F1 GP|2010|Korean}}.\n\nThe second half of the season gave more productive and consistent results; The drives of Kobayashi, Heidfeld and de la Rosa combined earned 44 points, giving the team eighth place in the Constructors' Championship.
