The Padres compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West]] division.

As of 2022, the Padres are the only team in California not to have won a World Series. \n\nFollowing the [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation]] of the [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]] to [[Los Angeles]] in 2017, the Padres became the only franchise in the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major American professional sports leagues]] in the [[Sports in San Diego|San Diego sports]] market.\n\nFrom 1969 through 2021, the Padres have an overall record of 3,863\u20134,495 ({{winpct|3863|4495}}).<ref>{{cite web|title=San Diego Padres Team History & Encyclopedia|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SDP/|website=[[Baseball-Reference]]|accessdate=October 3, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Franchise history==\n===Pacific Coast League===\n{{main|San Diego Padres (PCL)}}\nThe Padres adopted their name from the [[Pacific Coast League]] team that arrived in San Diego in 1936. That minor league franchise won the PCL title in 1937, led by 18-year-old [[Ted Williams]], the future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall-of-Famer]] who was a native of San Diego.  The team's name, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese for \"fathers\", refers to the Spanish [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s who founded [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1|San Diego]] in 1769.\n\n===Major League Baseball===\n{{main|History of the San Diego Padres}}\n[[File:Jack Murphy Stadium 1990.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Jack Murphy Stadium]], home stadium from 1969 to 2003]]\nIn [[1969 San Diego Padres season|1969]], the Padres joined the ranks of [[Major League Baseball]] as one of four new expansion teams, along with the [[Montreal Expos]] (now the [[Washington Nationals]]), the [[Kansas City Royals]], and the [[Seattle Pilots]] (now the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]). One of its earliest owners was [[C. Arnholt Smith]], a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|PCL Padres]] whose interests included banking, tuna fishing, hotels, real estate and an airline. Despite initial excitement, the guidance of longtime baseball executives, Eddie Leishman and [[Buzzie Bavasi]], as well as a new [[Qualcomm Stadium|playing field]], the team struggled; the Padres finished in last place in each of its first six seasons in the [[National League West|NL West]], losing 100 games or more four times. One of the few bright spots on the team during the early years was first baseman and slugger [[Nate Colbert]], an expansion draftee from the [[Houston Astros]] and still the Padres' career leader in home runs.\n\nThe team's fortunes gradually improved as they won five [[National League West]] titles and reached the [[World Series]] twice, in [[1984 World Series|1984]] and in [[1998 World Series|1998]], but lost both times. The Padres' main draw during the 1980s and 1990s was hall of famer [[Tony Gwynn]], who won eight league batting titles. They moved into their current stadium, [[Petco Park]], in [[2004 San Diego Padres season|2004]].\n\nOn August 20, 2020, the Padres became the first team in MLB history to hit a grand slam in four consecutive games earning the nickname, \"Slam Diego Padres\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/padres-hit-four-grand-slams-in-four-games|title=Padres hit four grand slams in four games|website=[[MLB.com]]|date=August 20, 2020|access-date=April 1, 2021}}</ref>\n\nUntil [[2021 San Diego Padres season|2021]], the Padres were the last team in MLB that had yet to throw a no-hitter. The record was broken on April 9, 2021, as [[Joe Musgrove]] accomplished the feat against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Musgrove makes history, spins SD's 1st no-no|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/joe-musgrove-throws-padres-first-no-hitter|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=[[MLB.com]]|date=April 10, 2021|access-date=April 11, 2021}}</ref> finally ending the longest no-hit drought by a team in MLB history. On September 5, 1997, [[Andy Ashby]] took a no-hitter into the 9th inning, which was previously the closest that the team had come to achieving this feat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-sep-06-sp-29508-story.html|title=Ashby No-Hitter Foiled in Ninth|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 6, 1997|access-date=April 1, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Spring training==\nThe team has played its spring training games at the [[Peoria Sports Complex]] in [[Peoria, Arizona]] since 1994. They share the stadium with the [[Seattle Mariners]].\n\nFrom 1969 to 1993, the Padres held spring training in [[Yuma, Arizona]] at [[Desert Sun Stadium]]. Due to the short driving distance and direct highway route ({{convert|170|mi}}, all on [[Interstate 8]]), Yuma was very popular with Padres fans, and many fans would travel by car from San Diego for spring training games. The move from Yuma to Peoria was very controversial, but was defended by the team as a reflection on the low quality of facilities in Yuma and the long travel necessary to play against other Arizona-based spring training teams (whose sites were all in the Phoenix and Tucson areas, both rather far from Yuma).\n\n==Logos and colors==\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = \n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background = \n| footer = \n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background = \n| image1 = San Diego Padres logo 1985.png\n| caption1 = Padres logo, 1985\n| image2 = San Diego Padres logo 1986 to 1989.png\n| caption2 = Padres logo, 1986\u201389\n| image3 = San Diego Padres logo 1990.png\n| caption3 = Padres logo, 1990\n| image4 = San Diego Padres logo 1992 to 1998.png\n| caption4 = Padres logo, 1991\u20132003\n| image5 = San Diego Padres alternate logo 2000 to 2003.png\n| caption5 = Padres alternate logo, 2000\u201303\n| image6 = San Diego Padres logo.svg\n| caption6 = Padres primary logo, 2012\u201314\n| image7 = SDPadres logo.svg\n| caption7 = Padres primary logo, 2015\u201319\n| image8 = SD Logo Brown.svg\n| caption8 = Padres primary logo, 2020\u2013\n| total_width = 1100\n}}\nThroughout the team's history, the San Diego Padres have used multiple logos, uniform, and color combinations.\n\n===1969\u20131979: Original brown & gold===\nTheir first logo in [[1969 San Diego Padres season|1969]] depicted a [[friar]] swinging a bat with Padres written at the top while standing in a sun-like figure with San Diego Padres on the exterior of it. The \"Swinging Friar\" has popped up on the uniform on and off ever since. Although the \"Swinging Friar\" is no longer used as the primary logo, it remains as the [[mascot]] of the team and is now used as an alternate logo and on the uniform sleeve.\n\nBrown and gold were the Padres' original colors. The team's first uniforms featured a cream base for the home uniforms and a tan base for the road uniforms. Brown letters with gold trim adorned the uniforms, which featured the team name in front of both designs. A second tan uniform, this time with the city name, was used as a road alternate before becoming the primary in [[1971 San Diego Padres season|1971]]. Caps were all-brown with the gold \"SD\", though the team later broke out an alternate gold cap with a brown brim and \"SD\" lettering.\n\n[[File:Randy Jones - San Diego Padres - 1978.jpg|thumb|upright|<!--Pitcher-->[[Randy Jones (baseball)|Randy Jones]] in [[1978 San Diego Padres season|1978]]]]\nSwitching from flannel to polyester in [[1972 San Diego Padres season|1972]], the Padres radically changed their uniforms. The team wore all-gold uniforms and pants regardless of road or home games, with the only difference being the road uniform emblazoned with the city name and the home uniform with the team name. The Padres also broke out a new brown cap, complete with a gold front panel and a brown \"SD\", which would remain for the next several years.  The gold front panel was shaped as a bell, alluding to the bells in the historic missions in California.\n\nIn [[1974 San Diego Padres season|1974]], the Padres returned to wearing traditional uniforms. The home design now had a script \"Padres\" lettering in front, with the road design keeping much of the original aesthetic. Chest numbers were also added. In&nbsp;[[1976 San Diego Padres season|1976]], the Padres ditched the buttons in favor of pullovers for their home uniform.<ref name=uncsuc>{{cite magazine |url=https://vault.si.com/vault/1976/07/12/uncommon-success-for-a-common-man |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Fimrite |first=Ron |title=Uncommon success for a common man |date=July 12, 1976 |page=20 |access-date=October 3, 2020 |archive-date=January 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102183931/https://vault.si.com/vault/1976/07/12/uncommon-success-for-a-common-man |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, they went with a brown uniform top for road games, featuring gold sleeves and gold letters.\n\nThe brown uniforms served as a template for the Padres' next uniform set beginning in [[1978 San Diego Padres season|1978]]. The home uniforms now featured brown sleeves and gold letters, and a gold alternate with brown sleeves and letters was also released. The full team name, which was written in a more futuristic font, was emblazoned in front while the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve. However, this set only lasted for that season, as the Padres tweaked its design the next season. The updated design removed the swinging friar logo while returning to the team name/city name dynamic for home and road games respectively. The gold uniforms were also retired.\n\n===1980\u20131984: Brown, gold, & orange===\n[[File:San Diego Padres Cap (1974 - 1984).svg|thumb|upright|Cap logo from 1969 to 1984.

The team's next uniform set removed the contrasting colored sleeves and chest numbers, and orange was added to the letters and striping of the home uniforms and trim and striping of the road uniforms. The caps were also updated to feature orange trim on the \"SD\" and within the gold panel.

That would later become a script logo for the Padres. The team's colors were changed to brown and orange and remained this way through the [[1990 San Diego Padres season|1990]] season. In [[1989 San Diego Padres season|1989]], the Padres took the scripted Padres logo and put it in a gray ring that read \"San Diego Baseball Club\" with a striped center.\n\nThat same year, the Padres returned to wearing traditional buttoned uniforms. The home uniforms featured the script \"Padres\" in front while the road uniforms had the \"SD\" emblazoned on the left chest. Brown letters with orange trim and brown pinstripes adorned both uniforms. The \"RAK\" initials remained until [[1986 San Diego Padres season|1986]]. An all-brown cap with the orange \"SD\" was used with the uniform.\n\n===1991\u20132003: Blue & orange===\nIn [[1991 San Diego Padres season|1991]], the Padres logo was updated. The color of the ring was changed to silver, and the Padres script was changed from brown to blue. The logo only lasted one year, as the Padres changed their logo for the third time in three years, again by switching colors of the ring. The logo became a white ring with fewer stripes in the center and a darker blue Padres script with orange shadows and they also wearing blue pin stripes. In 1991, the team's colors were also changed, to a combination of orange and navy blue.\n\nThe home uniform kept the pinstripes but was changed to navy blue, which was also implemented on the letters. The road uniforms eliminated the pinstripes and added the city name in navy blue block letters with white trim and orange drop shadows. A navy cap with the \"S\" in white and \"D\" in orange was used with the uniform. The team logo was added on the left sleeve in [[1996 San Diego Padres season|1996]].\n\nThe Padres unveiled a navy blue alternate uniform in [[1997 San Diego Padres season|1997]], featuring the team name in front written in navy blue with orange drop shadows. Other features included orange numbers at the back and white piping along the chest, neck and sleeves. White chest numbers were added in [[1999 San Diego Padres season|1999]]. Initially, the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve, but was removed after the [[1998 San Diego Padres season|1998]] season in favor of the team's primary logo which lasted until the [[2000 San Diego Padres season|2000]] season.\n\nThe following year, the Padres began wearing an alternate home white uniform which bore the same features as the primary home uniform minus the pinstripes and orange trim. Navy blue piping was also added. An alternate navy cap with the white \"SD\" was used with the uniform. This uniform became the primary in [[2001 San Diego Padres season|2001]], after which the pinstriped uniforms were retired following that season.\n\n===2004\u20132015: Blue & sand===\nThe logo was completely changed when the team changed stadiums between the [[2003 San Diego Padres season|2003]] and [[2004 San Diego Padres season|2004]] seasons, with the new logo looking similar to home plate with ''San Diego'' written in sand font at the top right corner and the Padres new script written completely across the center. Waves finished the bottom of the plate. Navy remained but a sandy beige replaced orange as a secondary color. The team's colors were also changed, to navy blue and sand brown. In&nbsp;[[2009 San Diego Padres season|2009]], the ''San Diego'' was removed from the top right corner of the logo.\n[[File:Jake Peavy 03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|[[Jake Peavy]] in 2006]]\nFor the next seven seasons the Padres were the only team in Major League Baseball that did not have a grey jersey. On the road, the team wore sand uniforms with the city name in front. The home design featured the updated \"Padres\" script in navy with sand drop shadows. Both uniforms featured the primary logo on the left sleeve. The alternate blue uniform featured the same \"Padres\" script in sand, and the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve. The Padres continued to wear their primary navy cap at home, while on the road they went with a second navy cap with \"SD\" in sand.\n\nIn [[2011 San Diego Padres season|2011]], the Padres' road uniform was changed to a grey base, and the navy and sand caps were used exclusively with the navy alternates. After the season, the alternate navy cap was retired.\n\nFor the [[2012 San Diego Padres season|2012]] season, the Padres unveiled a new primary logo, featuring the cap logo inside a navy blue circle with the words \"San Diego Padres Baseball Club\" adorning the outer circle. The \"swinging friar\" logo was recolored navy blue and white and was added to the left sleeve of the home uniform. Another secondary logo features the Padres script carried over from the previous year's primary logo below the depiction of [[Petco Park]] in sand and above the year of the team's first season (EST. 1969); this design was added to the team's road and navy alternates. While the home uniforms kept the sand trim, the road and navy alternates did not. In addition, the \"SD\" replaced \"Padres\" in front of the navy alternates, and the city name wordmark on the road uniforms was updated. All uniforms also added piping around the chest, neck and sleeves.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brock|first=Corey|title=Padres' new uniforms a nod to tradition|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/25946088/|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=November 9, 2011|access-date=January 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===2016\u20132019: Blue & white===\nIn the [[2016 San Diego Padres season|2016]] season, the Padres wore a navy blue and gold color scheme, similar to the one used on the [[2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2016 All-Star Game]] logo. The home uniform was patterned similarly to the alternate navy uniforms, with gold trim accenting the piping and letters.

The gold was scrapped from the home uniform and the team reverted to a navy blue-and-white combo. The word ''Padres'' returned to the front of the home uniform, but with a new script, while the script on the road uniform reverted to the ''San Diego'' wordmark style it used from 2004 to 2011.

The games are also broadcast in Spanish on [[XEMO-AM]],''La Poderosa 860 AM'', with Eduardo Ortega, Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez and Pedro Guti\u00e9rrez announcing. Padre games were also aired from 2006 to 2010 on [[XHPRS-FM]] 105.7.\n\nSpanish language telecasts of Sunday games are seen [[XHAS-TDT]] channel 33. Until September 2007, Friday and Saturday games were seen in Spanish on [[KSEX-CD|KBOP-CA]] channel 43, until that station changed to an all-infomercial format. This makes XHAS-TDT the only over-the-air-television station carrying Padres baseball. English-language Padres over-the-air broadcasts aired through the years on [[XETV-TDT|XETV-TV]] 6, [[KNSD|KCST-TV]] 39, [[KUSI-TV]] 51, [[KFMB-TV]] 8 and [[KSWB-TV]] 69.\n\nJohn Demott was the Padres' first public address announcer when the team began in 1969.  By the late 1970s, Bruce Binkowski had taken over as PA announcer, and became the longest-serving public address announcer in the team's history, remaining until the end of the 1999 season.  First DeMott and then Binkowski also were responsible with PA announcing duties for the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] and the [[San Diego State University]] Aztecs, both of which were joint tenants at Qualcomm Stadium with the Padres until the Padres moved into [[Petco Park]].  From Petco Park's opening in 2004 until 2013, the PA announcer was Frank Anthony, a radio host with 105.7 [[XHPRS-FM]]. On April 19, 2014, Alex Miniak was announced as the new Public Address announcer for the San Diego Padres. Miniak was formerly the PA announcer for the [[New Hampshire Fisher Cats]], the Double-A affiliate of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], and is the current PA commentator for the ''[[MLB The Show]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/san-diego-padres-name-alex-miniak-as-new-public-address-announcer/c-72718408|title=Padres name Miniak as new PA announcer|website=San Diego Padres|access-date=March 1, 2022|archive-date=January 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102184049/https://www.mlb.com/padres/news/san-diego-padres-name-alex-miniak-as-new-public-address-announcer/c-72718408|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe San Diego Padres were first portrayed in the 1979 [[NBC]] made-for-TV film ''[[The Kid from Left Field (1979 film)|The Kid from Left Field]]'', starring [[Gary Coleman]] as Jackie Robinson \"J.R.\" Cooper, a youngster who is passionate about baseball, and puts his knowledge to good use when he becomes the manager of the Padres and helps lead them to the [[World Series]].\n\nIn 2016, the San Diego Padres were portrayed once again in the one-season [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[Pitch (TV series)|Pitch]]'', starring [[Kylie Bunbury]] as Ginny Baker, the first female to play in Major League Baseball.\n\n== Educational involvement ==\nThe San Diego Padres established The Padres Scholars program, the first of its kind among professional sports. Originally each Padres scholar was selected as a seventh-grader and received a $5,000 scholarship after graduation from high school to go towards higher education. This program has reached 389 students from its establishment in 1995 to now. Over the past few years the program has undergone a few changes to be effective from an education standpoint. This program focuses on creating a close relationship between the chosen scholars and the team.  As of 2011, 3 high school seniors will be chosen to receive a $30,000 scholarship to be awarded through the course of their higher education. Maintaining this prestigious award is conditional on maintaining contact with the Padres and providing proof of good academic standing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sandiego.padres.mlb.com/sd/community/padres_scholars.jsp |title=Padres Scholars|publisher=San Diego Padres |date=June 19, 2012 |access-date=January 31, 2013 |archive-date=January 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102184140/https://www.mlb.com/padres/community/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe San Diego Padres are the sponsors of and heavily involved in most aspects of the Sports Business Management MBA degree program offered in conjunction with [[San Diego State University]]'s [[San Diego State University College of Business Administration|College of Business Administration]].
