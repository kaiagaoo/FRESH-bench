The Padres compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[National League (baseball)|National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West Division]]. The team plays its home games at [[Petco Park]] in [[downtown San Diego]]. Founded in 1969 as [[1969 Major League Baseball expansion|an expansion franchise]], the Padres adopted their name from the [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL) team that arrived in San Diego in 1936. The team's name, Spanish for \"fathers\", refers to the Spanish [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s who founded [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1|Mission San Diego]] in 1769.\n\nIn 1976, [[Randy Jones (baseball)|Randy Jones]] achieved the first [[Cy Young Award]] for the Padres. In the 1980s, [[Tony Gwynn]] became a major star, winning eight National League [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting titles]]. Under manager [[Dick Williams]], the Padres clinched their first [[NL pennant]], losing to the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the [[1984 World Series]]. In 1995, [[Kevin Towers]] became general manager; under his lead, [[Ken Caminiti]] became the first Padres player to win the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Award]]. The Padres achieved their second NL pennant alongside [[Trevor Hoffman]], eventually being swept by the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[1998 World Series]].\n\nThe Padres are owned by the estate of [[Peter Seidler]], who owned the team from 2012 until his death in 2023. The team has won two NL pennants, in [[1984 San Diego Padres season|1984]] and [[1998 San Diego Padres season|1998]], losing in the [[World Series]] both years; they are the oldest team that has never won the World Series, along with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. As of [[2024 San Diego Padres season|2024]], the Padres have had 18 winning seasons in [[List of San Diego Padres seasons|franchise history]]. Despite reaching the postseason five times from 2005 to 2024, the team has yet to return to the World Series. From 1969 through 2024, the Padres have an overall record of {{Win\u2013loss record|w=4,127|l=4,717|t=2}} ({{winpct|4127|4717|2}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=San Diego Padres Team History & Encyclopedia |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SDP/ |access-date=September 30, 2024 |website=[[Baseball-Reference]]}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|{{recentism|section|date=November 2024}}{{overly detailed|section|date=November 2024}}}}\n{{main|History of the San Diego Padres}}\nThe Padres adopted their name from the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], a team that arrived in San Diego in 1936. This minor league franchise won the PCL title in 1937, led by 18-year-old [[Ted Williams]], the future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] who was a native of San Diego. \n\nIn [[1969 San Diego Padres season|1969]], the Padres joined the ranks of [[Major League Baseball]] as one of four new expansion teams, along with the [[Montreal Expos]] (now the [[Washington Nationals]]), the [[Kansas City Royals]], and the [[Seattle Pilots]] (now the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]). \n\nOne of its earliest owners was [[C. Arnholt Smith]], a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|PCL Padres]]. Despite initial excitement, the guidance of longtime baseball executives, Eddie Leishman and [[Buzzie Bavasi]], as well as a [[San Diego Stadium|new stadium]], the team struggled; the Padres finished in last place in each of its first six seasons in the [[National League West|NL West]], losing 100 games or more four times. One of the few bright spots on the team during the early years was first baseman and slugger [[Nate Colbert]], an expansion draftee from the [[Houston Astros]] and was the long-time home run leader until 2024, when [[Manny Machado]] overtook him.\n\nThe team's fortunes gradually improved as they won five [[National League West]] titles and reached the [[World Series]] twice, in [[1984 World Series|1984]] and in [[1998 World Series|1998]], but lost both times. The Padres' main draw during the 1980s and 1990s was Hall of Famer [[Tony Gwynn]], who won eight league batting titles. They moved into their current stadium, [[Petco Park]], in [[2004 San Diego Padres season|2004]].\n\nOn August 20, 2020, the Padres became the first team in MLB history to hit a grand slam in four consecutive games earning the nickname, \"Slam Diego Padres\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/padres-hit-four-grand-slams-in-four-games|title=Padres hit four grand slams in four games|website=[[MLB.com]]|date=August 20, 2020|access-date=April 1, 2021}}</ref>\n\nUntil [[2021 San Diego Padres season|2021]], the Padres were the last team in MLB that had yet to throw a no-hitter. The record was broken on April 9, 2021, as [[Joe Musgrove]] accomplished the feat against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Musgrove makes history, spins SD's 1st no-no|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/joe-musgrove-throws-padres-first-no-hitter|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=[[MLB.com]]|date=April 10, 2021|access-date=April 11, 2021}}</ref> finally ending the longest no-hit drought by a team in MLB history.

The \"Swinging Friar\" has popped up on the uniform on and off ever since. Although the \"Swinging Friar\" is no longer used as the primary logo, it remains as the [[mascot]] of the team and is now used as an alternate logo and on the uniform sleeve.\n\nBrown and gold were the Padres' original colors. The team's first uniforms featured a cream base for the home uniforms and a tan base for the road uniforms. Brown letters with gold trim adorned the uniforms, which featured the team name in front of both designs. A second tan uniform, this time with the city name, was used as a road alternate before becoming the primary in [[1971 San Diego Padres season|1971]]. Caps were all-brown with the gold \"SD\", though the team later broke out an alternate gold cap with a brown brim and \"SD\" letters.\n\n[[File:Randy Jones - San Diego Padres - 1978.jpg|thumb|upright|<!--Pitcher-->[[Randy Jones (baseball)|Randy Jones]] in [[1978 San Diego Padres season|1978]]]]\nSwitching from flannel to polyester in [[1972 San Diego Padres season|1972]], the Padres radically changed their uniforms. The team wore all-gold uniforms and pants regardless of road or home games, with the only difference being the road uniform emblazoned with the city name and the home uniform with the team name. The Padres also broke out a new brown cap, complete with a gold front panel and a brown \"SD\", which would remain for the next several years. The gold front panel was shaped as a bell, alluding to the bells in historic missions in California.\n\nIn [[1974 San Diego Padres season|1974]], the Padres returned to wearing traditional uniforms. The home design now had a script \"Padres\" lettering in front, with the road design keeping much of the original aesthetic. Chest numbers were also added. In&nbsp;[[1976 San Diego Padres season|1976]], the Padres ditched the buttons in favor of pullovers for their home uniform.<ref name=\"uncsuc\">{{cite magazine |last=Fimrite |first=Ron |date=July 12, 1976 |title=Uncommon success for a common man |url=https://vault.si.com/vault/1976/07/12/uncommon-success-for-a-common-man |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102183931/https://vault.si.com/vault/1976/07/12/uncommon-success-for-a-common-man |archive-date=January 2, 2021 |access-date=October 3, 2020 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |page=20}}</ref> In addition, they went with a brown uniform top for road games, featuring gold sleeves and gold letters.\n\nThe brown uniforms served as a template for the Padres' next uniform set beginning in [[1978 San Diego Padres season|1978]]. The home uniforms now featured brown sleeves and gold letters, and a gold alternate with brown sleeves and letters was also released. The full team name, which was written in a more futuristic font, was emblazoned in front while the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve. However, this set only lasted for that season, as the Padres tweaked its design the next season. The updated design removed the swinging friar logo while returning to the team name/city name dynamic for home and road games respectively. The gold uniforms were also retired.\n\n===1980\u20131984: Brown, gold, & orange===\n[[File:San Diego Padres Cap (1974 - 1984).svg|thumb|upright|Cap logo from 1969 to 1984.

The team's next uniform set removed the contrasting colored sleeves and chest numbers, and orange was added to the letters and striping of the home uniforms and trim and striping of the road uniforms. The caps were also updated to feature orange trim on the \"SD\" and within the gold panel.

That would later become a script logo for the Padres. The team's colors were changed to brown and orange and remained this way through the [[1990 San Diego Padres season|1990 season]]. In [[1989 San Diego Padres season|1989]], the Padres took the scripted Padres logo and put it in a gray ring that read \"San Diego Baseball Club\" with a striped center.\n\nThat same year, the Padres returned to wearing traditional buttoned uniforms designed by [[Nicolas Sidjakov|Sidjakov Berman & Gomez]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/30/sports/scouting-high-fashion.html Durso, Joseph. \"Scouting: High Fashion,\" ''The New York Times'', Wednesday, January 30, 1985.] Retrieved October 25, 2023.</ref> The home uniforms featured the script \"Padres\" in front while the road uniforms had the \"SD\" emblazoned on the left chest. Brown letters with orange trim and brown pinstripes adorned both uniforms. The \"RAK\" initials remained until [[1986 San Diego Padres season|1986]]. An all-brown cap with the orange \"SD\" was used with the uniform.\n\n===1991\u20132003: Blue & orange===\n[[File:Tony Gwynn Hall of Fame exhibit.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Tony Gwynn]] exhibit in 2007, featuring the 1994 home and 2001 alternate Padres uniform.]]\nIn [[1991 San Diego Padres season|1991]], the Padres logo was updated. The color of the ring was changed to silver, and the Padres script was changed from brown to blue. The logo only lasted one year, as the Padres changed their logo for the third time in three years, again by switching colors of the ring. The logo became a white ring with fewer stripes in the center and a darker blue Padres script with orange shadows and they also wearing blue pin stripes. In 1991, the team's colors were also changed, to a combination of orange and navy blue.\n\nThe home uniform kept the pinstripes but was changed to navy blue, which was also implemented on the letters. The road uniforms eliminated the pinstripes and added the city name in navy blue block letters with white trim and orange drop shadows. A navy cap with the \"S\" in white and \"D\" in orange was used with the uniform. The team logo was added on the left sleeve in [[1996 San Diego Padres season|1996]].\n\nThe Padres unveiled a navy blue alternate uniform in [[1997 San Diego Padres season|1997]], featuring the team name in front written in navy blue with orange drop shadows. Other features included orange numbers at the back and white piping along the chest, neck and sleeves. White chest numbers were added in [[1999 San Diego Padres season|1999]]. Initially, the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve, but was removed after the [[1998 San Diego Padres season|1998 season]] in favor of the team's primary logo which lasted until the [[2000 San Diego Padres season|2000 season]].\n\nThe following year, the Padres began wearing an alternate home white uniform which bore the same features as the primary home uniform minus the pinstripes and orange trim. Navy blue piping was also added. An alternate navy cap with the white \"SD\" was used with the uniform. This uniform became the primary in [[2001 San Diego Padres season|2001]], after which the pinstriped uniforms were retired following that season.\n\n===2004\u20132015: Blue & sand===\nThe logo was completely changed when the team changed stadiums between the [[2003 San Diego Padres season|2003]] and [[2004 San Diego Padres season|2004 season]]s, with the new logo looking similar to home plate with ''San Diego'' written in sand font at the top right corner and the Padres new script written completely across the center. Waves finished the bottom of the plate. Navy remained but a sandy beige replaced orange as a secondary color. The team's colors were also changed, to navy blue and sand brown. In&nbsp;[[2009 San Diego Padres season|2009]], the ''San Diego'' was removed from the top right corner of the logo.\n[[File:Jake Peavy 03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|[[Jake Peavy]] in 2006]]\nFor the next seven seasons the Padres were the only team in Major League Baseball that did not have a grey jersey. On the road, the team wore sand uniforms with the city name in front. The home design featured the updated \"Padres\" script in navy with sand drop shadows. Both uniforms featured the primary logo on the left sleeve. The alternate blue uniform featured the same \"Padres\" script in sand, and the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve. The Padres continued to wear their primary navy cap at home, while on the road they went with a second navy cap with \"SD\" in sand.\n\nIn [[2011 San Diego Padres season|2011]], the Padres' road uniform was changed to a grey base, and the navy and sand caps were used exclusively with the navy alternates. After the season, the alternate navy cap was retired.\n\nFor the [[2012 San Diego Padres season|2012 season]], the Padres unveiled a new primary logo, featuring the cap logo inside a navy blue circle with the words \"San Diego Padres Baseball Club\" adorning the outer circle. The \"swinging friar\" logo was recolored navy blue and white and was added to the left sleeve of the home uniform. Another secondary logo features the Padres script carried over from the previous year's primary logo below the depiction of [[Petco Park]] in sand and above the year of the team's first season (EST. 1969); this design was added to the team's road and navy alternates. While the home uniforms kept the sand trim, the road and navy alternates did not. In addition, the \"SD\" replaced \"Padres\" in front of the navy alternates, and the city name wordmark on the road uniforms was updated. All uniforms also added piping around the chest, neck and sleeves.<ref>{{cite web |last=Brock |first=Corey |date=November 9, 2011 |title=Padres' new uniforms a nod to tradition |url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/25946088/ |access-date=January 10, 2016 |publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]}}</ref>\n\n===2016\u20132019: Blue & white===\nIn the [[2016 San Diego Padres season|2016 season]], the Padres wore a navy blue and gold color scheme, similar to the one used on the [[2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2016 All-Star Game]] logo.

The gold was scrapped from the home uniform and the team reverted to a navy blue-and-white combo. The word ''Padres'' returned to the front of the home uniform, but with a new script, while the script on the road uniform reverted to the ''San Diego'' wordmark style it used from 2004 to 2011.

An all-brown cap with \"SD\" in gold was also released. With the uniform change, the San Diego Padres are once again the only team in the league that do not feature a grey jersey.\n\nThe return to brown and gold uniforms has coincided with an increase in team merchandise sales, with the Padres ranking in the top 10 in MLB team merchandise sales at U.S. sports retailer Lids during the 2022 season.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Puccio |first=Anthony |date=October 27, 2022 |title=Yankees & Dodgers Dominate Lids MLB Team Gear Sales |url=https://boardroom.tv/yankees-dodgers-lids-mlb-sales/ |access-date=July 24, 2023 |website=Boardroom |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n====City Connect====\nIn [[2022 San Diego Padres season|2022]], the Padres joined 13 other teams in wearing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s \"[[City Connect]]\" uniforms.

He swings a [[baseball bat]] and rings a mission bell at home games immediately after a win. He is named and patterned after the Spanish [[Franciscan]]s, who founded [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1]] around which the city of [[San Diego]] was established in 1769.\n\nThe Swinging Friar was designed by 19-year-old Carlos Hadaway in the 1950s and first appeared on team programs for the 1962 home opener, when the Padres were still a member of the [[Pacific Coast League]], a [[Minor League Baseball]] organization. The mascot was retained when the team joined [[Major League Baseball]] in 1969. Originally, the Swinging Friar was represented at the ballpark as a real man wearing a friar outfit. Since the 1990s, the character has been a full mascot costume.<ref name=\"MLB\">{{Cite web |title=Swinging Friar - San Diego Padres |url=https://sportmascots.com/mlb/swinging-friar-san-diego-padres/ |access-date=October 9, 2023 |website=SportMascots.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=This Day in Padres History, 4/15 |url=https://padres.mlblogs.com/this-day-in-padres-history-4-15-a078f4c2e86e/ |access-date=June 4, 2024 |website=FriarWire on Medium.com |date=April 15, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe [[San Diego Chicken]] has often been mistaken as the Padres' team mascot due to the frequency with which he appears at Padres games. Although he does make appearances at San Diego sporting events, the Famous Chicken is an independent character owned by professional mascot [[Ted Giannoulas]] and has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team.\n\n==Rivalry==\n{{main|Dodgers\u2013Padres rivalry}}\n\nThe Padres' historical rivalry against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] has often been largely lopsided in favor of LA, however; recent growth between the two teams in competition during the 2020s has added intensity on top of proximity between Los Angeles and San Diego (driving from [[Dodger Stadium]] to Petco Park can be done by simply taking [[Interstate 5]]). San Diego fans have often harbored animosity towards Los Angeles due in small part to San Diego being an unstable home for multiple sports franchises as both the [[Los Angeles Chargers|Chargers]] and the [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]] had relocated to Los Angeles after being unable to secure either a new arena or stable finances in San Diego. Following the [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation]] of the [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]] to [[Los Angeles]] in 2017, the Padres became the only franchise in the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major American professional sports leagues]] in the [[Sports in San Diego|San Diego sports]] market, strengthening the rivalry and San Diego's animosity to Los Angeles sports in general. The Dodgers currently lead the series 504\u2013412, and both teams have met in the post season three times (Los Angeles winning the [[2020 NLDS]] and [[2024 NLDS]], while San Diego won in [[2022 National League Division Series|2022]]). Off the field, the rivalry has been just as competitive, as the two teams have aggressively battled on the trade market and free agency over numerous star players.<ref>{{cite web |date=August 2, 2022 |title=San Diego Padres trade for Washington Nationals slugger Juan Soto |url=https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/34334378/san-diego-padres-agree-trade-washington-nationals-slugger-juan-soto-sources-say |access-date=August 4, 2022 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military appreciation==\nIn 1996, the Padres became the first national sports team to have an annual military appreciation event.<ref>{{cite news |author=[[Mass Communication Specialist|MC]]1 Kim McLendon |date=April 9, 2008 |title=Padres Salute Armed Forces With Military Appreciation Night |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=36238 |access-date=February 21, 2011 |newspaper=Navy News Service}}<br />{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=September 2, 2011 |title=America's Fans: Our Military and Major League Baseball |url=http://www.ourmilitary.mil/recent-news/americas-fans-our-military-and-mlb |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219191240/http://www.ourmilitary.mil/recent-news/americas-fans-our-military-and-mlb |archive-date=February 19, 2013 |access-date=April 28, 2013 |website=ourmilitary.mil |publisher=United States Department of defense }}</ref> In 2000, the Padres began wearing a [[Military camouflage|camouflage]] jersey to honor the [[United States armed forces|military]].
