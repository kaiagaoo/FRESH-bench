The red uniforms mirror the striping configurations of the white uniforms while the city name and numerals were in blue with white trim.<ref name=NetsUniforms>{{cite web|title=Nets uniform history|url=https://www.nba.com/nets/history/uniform-history|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=BrooklynNets.com|access-date=October 17, 2020|archive-date=December 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201204212754/https://www.nba.com/nets/history/uniform-history|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===New York Nets===\n====1968\u20131972====\nMoving to Long Island as the New York Nets, they kept the original Americans template except for the location and team name. The white uniforms featured a script \"Nets\" lettering with a tail accent below, while the red uniforms featured \"New York\" in block letters (similar to the New York Knicks). Over the years, the letters and stripes would endure a few adjustments.<ref name=NetsUniforms/>\n\n====1972\u20131977====\nThe Nets changed uniforms upon moving to Nassau Coliseum. The white uniforms featured a thick blue stripe with white stars on the left, along with a red stripe and white outline. The team name is written in red block letters. The blue uniforms, which featured \"New York\" in white block letters, mirrored that of the white uniforms.<ref name=NetsUniforms/>\n\n===New Jersey Nets===\n====1977\u20131981; 1983\u20131990====\nThe Nets carried the \"Stars and Stripes\" uniform to New Jersey in 1977. The white uniform remained the same but the blue uniform read \"Nets\" in front. The blue uniform later added \"New Jersey\" in white block letters inside the red stripe.<ref name=NetsUniforms/>\n\n====1981\u20131983====\nUpon moving to the Meadowlands in 1981, the Nets briefly changed their uniform set. The white uniform brought back the \"Nets\" script from the original New York Nets uniforms, but the color scheme became blue with red trim. The blue uniform featured \"New Jersey\" stacked together in a similar script style, and the letters were colored in red with white trim.<ref name=NetsUniforms/>\n\n====1990\u20131997====\nThe Nets underwent a visual rebrand before the 1990\u201391 season. The white uniform featured a more futuristic \"Nets\" script in red with white and blue trim, while adding red and blue stripes. Initially, the Nets wore white and light blue gradient road uniforms that had a [[tie-dye]] effect, but switched to a solid blue uniform after only one season. Both blue uniforms featured the same \"Nets\" script in red with blue and white trim along with red and white stripes.<ref name=NetsUniforms/>\n\n====1997\u20132012====\nThe Nets updated their visual identity prior to the 1997\u201398 season, going with a deeper red and navy scheme with silver accents. The white uniform, which remained virtually unchanged throughout its history, featured the team name in navy with silver and red trim. The navy uniform featured the city name in silver with navy and red trim. The dark grey alternate uniform, used until 2006, initially went with the city name in navy with white and red trim, but reversed the color scheme to white with red and navy trim after only two seasons. This uniform was the only one to feature the \"NJ\" alternate logo on the neckline. The red alternate uniform, which replaced the grey alternate and became the primary dark uniform in 2009, featured the team name in white with navy and silver trim. All uniforms featured thick navy and silver [[argyle (pattern)|argyle]] stripes.<ref name=NetsUniforms/>\n\n===Brooklyn Nets===\n\n====2012\u20132017====\nUpon moving to Brooklyn in 2012, the Nets went with a simple black and white uniform design, with \"Brooklyn\" in front of both the white and black uniforms. They also wore three different alternate uniforms. A grey-sleeved alternate with \"Brooklyn\" in [[Dodger blue]], was first used in 2013 as a visual recall to the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. A white-sleeved alternate with the team name in black, featured the same \"Stars and Stripes\" look from the 1970s. A dark grey sleeveless alternate, meant to recall the 1980s New Jersey Nets uniforms, featured the team name in white and the city name in white written inside a black stripe.<ref name=NetsUniforms/>\n\n====2017\u2013present====\nWith the switch from [[Adidas]] to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], the Nets kept most aspects of their visual identity intact. The white uniform became the \"Association\" uniform while the black uniform became the \"Icon\" uniform. The Nets have had three different versions of the \"Statement\" uniform. The first set, with \"BKLYN\" in white, was in dark grey and featured the same stars and stripes look from the 1970s. The uniform was updated in 2019 to a lighter grey base and black/dark grey stripes, with \"BKLYN\" written in [[graffiti]] style designed by Eric Haze. In 2022, the Nets again changed its \"Statement\" uniform, this time with a black base, black letters with silver trim, and a subtle greyscale herringbone striping with three black stars on the left.<ref name=NetsUniforms/>\n\nThe Nets also employed a fourth uniform option: the \"City\" uniform. The 2017\u201318 black \"City\" uniform featured the full team name spelled in white along with grey accents inspired from the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. The following season, it was replaced with a black uniform featuring stylized Brooklyn camo patterns as a tribute to [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] For 2019\u201320, the Nets wore white versions of the \"Biggie\" uniforms, but with Haze-designed \"BED-STUY\" graffiti lettering in front (a reference to [[Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant]] where The Notorious B.I.G. grew up). The 2020\u201321 \"City\" uniform, which honors Brooklyn-born artist [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], is predominantly black and features \"BKLYN NETS\" written in Basquiat's style along with multi-colored striping.<ref name=NetsUniforms/> The Basquiat-inspired \"City\" uniform returned in 2022\u201323 but in a white base.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brooklyn Nets 22/23 City Edition Uniform: Brooklyn Graffiti|url=https://www.nba.com/news/brooklyn-nets-city-edition|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|access-date=November 10, 2022|archive-date=November 10, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221110183418/https://www.nba.com/news/brooklyn-nets-city-edition|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2021\u201322 season, the Nets' \"City\" uniform featured visual references to the Nets' uniform history. The navy base and white and silver argyle stripes recalled the 1997\u20132009 uniforms. The \"Nets\" wordmark and lettering were taken from the 1990\u201397 uniforms. A red stripe with white stars honored the \"Stars and Stripes\" uniform of the 1970s and 1980s. A modified version of the 1980s New Jersey Nets logo, replacing the New Jersey outline with the map of Brooklyn, was added to the right leg. The 1997\u20132012 shield logo, also tweaked to feature the current \"B\" alternate logo, was added on the waist.<ref>{{cite web|title=2021\u201322 Nets City uniform|url=https://www.nba.com/nets/city-edition|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=BrooklynNets.com|access-date=November 3, 2021|archive-date=November 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211102160934/https://www.nba.com/nets/city-edition|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe \"City\" uniform for the 2023\u201324 season featured a collaboration with Brooklyn-based artist [[Kaws]].

Reznick will not \"whammy\" players that have previously played for the Nets. Reznick believes the practice is effective as [[Barclays Center]] often has one of the lowest opposing team free throw percentages in the league. For example, by January 11, 2023, opposing teams had only a 70.3 free throw shot percentage in Brooklyn, which was about eight points lower than league average for the [[2022\u201323 NBA season]].

The team played their home games during the 2016\u201317 season at the Barclays Center and then at the [[Nassau Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]], after renovations were complete for the 2017\u201318 season. The Long Island Nets became the twelfth D-League team to be owned by an NBA team.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Brooklyn Nets Purchase NBA Development League Team|url=https://gleague.nba.com/news/brooklyn-nets-purchase-nba-development-league-team/|website=GLeague.NBA.com|date=November 6, 2015|access-date=February 14, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{See also|List of Brooklyn Nets broadcasters}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe television home of the Nets is currently the [[YES Network]], which the team helped create while they were under the corporate umbrella of [[Yankee Global Enterprises|YankeeNets LLC]], a merger of business operations between the Nets and the [[New York Yankees]]. After the dissolution of YankeeNets and Bruce Ratner's purchase of the team, YES signed a long-term deal to keep broadcasting Nets games. The sale to the Ratner group did not include the percentage of YES that was previously owned by the Nets, which remains with the pre-merger Nets owners. Prior to that, the Nets' TV home was [[Fox Sports Net New York]] and [[SportsChannel New York]].\n\nSelect playoff games air [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] on [[WWOR-TV]] instead of on YES, this is only when Yankees games are airing at the same time. Previously these games aired on [[WLNY-TV]] or [[WPIX]].\n\nThe current [[flagship (radio)|flagship radio station]] of the Nets is [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]], which took over the radio rights to the Nets after losing their basketball contract with the [[New York Knicks|Knicks]] (who moved to [[WEPN (AM)|WEPN]]). Prior to that, Nets games aired on [[WBBR|WNEW]], [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]], [[WVNJ]], [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]], [[WFME (AM)|WQEW]], and [[WOR (AM)|WOR]].\n\nIn the club's early ABA years, some Sunday road games were televised in a package carried by [[WPIX]]. The team's later ABA tenure featured more frequent road telecasts on their current broadcast partner, WWOR-TV. Known then as WOR-TV, it continued airing road games for a time once the team joined the NBA in 1976.\n\n===Television===\n[[Ian Eagle]] has been the sole television play-by-play announcer for the Nets since the departure of [[Marv Albert]] in 2011. Eagle became the lead television voice for the team in 1995 after serving as the team's radio voice for one year, while Albert joined the Nets following his firing by [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]] in 2005 after four decades as the lead voice of the [[New York Knicks]]. When Albert joined the broadcast team, he became the lead broadcaster with Eagle as his substitute; beginning in the 2009\u201310 season, due to Albert's advancing age and his other commitments, Eagle once again assumed the lead play-by-play spot. [[Ryan Ruocco]] substitutes for Eagle during the latter's CBS NFL and NCAA commitments.\n\nAs of 2021, [[Sarah Kustok]] and [[Richard Jefferson]] provide color commentary on YES Network broadcasts, and Michael Grady serves as courtside reporter.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dowd |first1=Tom |title=YES Network Looks Ahead to the Brooklyn Nets and Broadcasting the 2020-21 Season |url=https://www.nba.com/nets/news/feature/2020/12/08/yes-network-looks-ahead-to-the-brooklyn-nets-and-broadcasting-the-2020-21-nba-season |website=NBA.com |access-date=February 8, 2021 |date=December 8, 2020 |archive-date=February 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210214212757/https://www.nba.com/nets/news/feature/2020/12/08/yes-network-looks-ahead-to-the-brooklyn-nets-and-broadcasting-the-2020-21-nba-season |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Radio===\n[[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]] is the Nets' current radio flagship, the station having assumed radio rights from [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] following the 2003\u201304 season. [[Chris Carrino]] and [[Tim Capstraw]] comprise the broadcast team, Carrino on play-by-play and Capstraw as the analyst. The games air on other [[Entercom]]-operated stations, such as [[WCBS (AM)]] and [[WXBK]], when there are programming conflicts on WFAN.\n\nOther broadcasters who have worked for the Nets include [[Howard David]], [[Bob Papa]], [[Bill Raftery]], [[Kelly Tripucka]], [[Albert King (basketball)|Albert King]], Mike O'Koren, [[Spencer Ross]], [[Mel Proctor]], [[Joe Tait]], [[John Sterling (sportscaster)|John Sterling]], [[John Minko]] and [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]].\n\nNets games have also aired on [[WBBR|WNEW]] and [[WFME (AM)|WQEW]] in the past.\n\nDuring the club's ABA years, announcers included [[Marty Glickman]], Marv Albert's brothers [[Al Albert (sportscaster)|Al Albert]] and [[Steve Albert]], baseball Hall of Fame pitcher [[Bob Gibson]], Bob Goldsholl, as well as Sterling and Vince DiTomasso. The latter two joined the club's move into the NBA.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{notelist}}\n;Sources\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=<ref name=\"rivalry begins\">{{cite news | url=http://fort-greene.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/knicks-and-nets-rivalry-begins-at-barclays/ | work=The New York Times | first=Chris | last=Dell | title=Knicks and Nets Rivalry Begins at Barclays | date=November 27, 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201132239/http://fort-greene.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/knicks-and-nets-rivalry-begins-at-barclays/ | archive-date=December 1, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Brooklyn Nets}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Brooklyn Nets}}\n{{Navboxes|titlestyle = {{NBA color cell|Brooklyn Nets|border=2}}|list =\n{{Brooklyn Nets seasons}}\n{{NBA}}\n{{ABAteams}}\n{{New York Sports}}\n{{NewYorksports}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|Basketball|New York City|New York (state)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Brooklyn Nets| ]]\n[[Category:American Basketball Association teams]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association teams]]\n[[Category:Basketball teams established in 1967]]\n[[Category:1967 establishments in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:New Jersey Nets]]\n[[Category:Basketball teams in New York City|Nets]]\n[[Category:YES Network]]\n[[Category:Forest City Realty Trust]]"}
