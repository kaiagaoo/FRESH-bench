Two businessmen had tried and failed to get Dallas a team in the NFL: [[Lamar Hunt]] responded by forming the [[American Football League]] with a group of owners, which would spur the NFL to expand beyond twelve teams. Oilman [[Clint Murchison, Jr.|Clint Murchison Jr.]] persisted with his intent to bring a team to Dallas, but [[George Preston Marshall]], owner of the [[Washington Commanders|Washington Redskins]], had a monopoly in the [[Southern United States|South]] (after the addition of Dallas, the South would see three further teams - NFL teams in Atlanta and New Orleans, and an AFL team in Miami - added in the next six years).<ref name=\"l020\">{{Cite web |last=Sullivan |first=Jeff |date=2020-01-28 |title=How the Dallas Cowboys Were Born in 1960 |url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/how-the-dallas-cowboys-were-born-in-1960 |access-date=2024-08-24 |website=DallasCowboys.com}}</ref>\n\nMurchison had tried to purchase the Washington Redskins (now Commanders) from Marshall in 1958 with the intent of moving them to Dallas. An agreement was struck, but as the deal was about to be finalized, Marshall called for a change in terms, which infuriated Murchison, and he called off the deal.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 22, 2012 |title=Horn: What if the Redskins had actually moved to Dallas?

Since NFL expansion needed unanimous approval from team owners at that time, Marshall's position would prevent Murchison from joining the league.\n\nMarshall had a falling out with the Redskins band leader Barnee Breeskin, who had written the music to the Redskins fight song \"[[Hail to the Redskins]]\", and Marshall's wife had penned the lyrics. Breeskin owned the rights to the song and was aware of Murchison's plight to get an NFL franchise. Angry with Marshall, Breeskin approached Murchison's attorney to sell him the rights to the song before the expansion vote in 1959: Murchison subsequently purchased \"Hail to the Redskins\" for $2,500.<ref name=\"Snider\">{{Cite magazine |last=Snider |first=Rick |date=June 17, 2020 |title=Ol' Ricky's Redskins Tales - Hail to the Redskins + Dwayne's Gain |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/commanders/news/ol-rickys-redskins-tales-hail-to-the-redskins-dwaynes-gain |access-date=November 14, 2023 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |language=en}}</ref>\n\nBefore the vote to award franchises in 1959, Murchison revealed to Marshall that he now owned the song, and barred Marshall from playing it during games.

In the Divisional Round they squeaked by the [[Atlanta Falcons]] 30\u201327.

Romo returned in Week 9 to lead a 31\u201317 victory over the [[2014 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], which was played at [[Wembley Stadium]] in [[London, England]] as part of the [[NFL International Series]]. Dallas played their traditional Thanksgiving home game against their division rival [[2014 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]]. Both teams were vying for first place in the division with identical 8\u20133 records. The Eagles got off to a fast start and the Cowboys were unable to catch up, losing 33\u201310.

However, towards the end of the second quarter, Romo threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams. [[Matt Prater]] of the Lions would kick a field goal before halftime to go up 17\u20137. Dallas came out swinging to start the second half by picking off Detroit quarterback [[Matthew Stafford]] on the first play of the third quarter. However, the Cowboys failed to capitalize on the turnover, as Dan Bailey missed a field goal during Dallas's ensuing drive. Detroit then kicked another field goal to make the score 20\u20137. A DeMarco Murray touchdown later in that quarter closed the gap to 20\u201314. A 51-yard Bailey field goal almost 3 minutes into the fourth quarter trimmed the Cowboys' deficit to 3. The Lions got the ball back and started driving down the field. On 3rd down-and-1 of that Lions drive, Stafford threw a 17-yard pass intended for Lions tight end [[Brandon Pettigrew]], but the ball hit Cowboys linebacker [[Anthony Hitchens]] in the back a fraction of a second before he ran into Pettigrew. The play was initially flagged as defensive pass interference against Hitchens. However, the penalty was then nullified by the officiating crew. The Cowboys got the ball back on their 41-yard line and had a successful 59-yard drive which was capped off by an 8-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Williams to give the Cowboys their first lead of the game at 24\u201320. The Lions got the ball back with less than 2:30 to play in regulation. Stafford fumbled the ball at the 2-minute mark. The fumble was recovered by Cowboys defensive end [[DeMarcus Lawrence]], who then fumbled the ball which was recovered by the Lions. Lawrence would redeem himself by sacking Stafford on a 4th down-and-3 play.

The blue star originally was a solid shape until a white line and blue border were added in 1964. The logo has remained the same since. Today, the blue star has been extended to not only the Dallas Cowboys, but owner Jerry Jones' defunct [[Arena Football League|AFL]] team, the [[Dallas Desperados]] that used a similar logo based on that of the Cowboys. The blue star also is used on other entries like an imaging facility and storage facility.\n\n===Uniforms===\n{{multiple image\n|align = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|total_width= 300\n|image1 = Dallas Cowboys helmet Front.jpg\n|image2 = Dallas Cowboys helmet Back.jpg|Back of Dallas Cowboys helmet\n|footer = Front and back of Cowboys helmet\n}}\nThe Dallas Cowboys' white home jersey has royal blue (PMS 287 C) solid socks, numbers, lettering, and two stripes on the sleeves outlined in black. The home pants are a common metallic silver-green color (PMS 8280 C) that helps bring out the blue in the uniform. The navy (PMS 289 C) road jerseys (nicknamed the \"Stars and Stripes\" jersey) have white lettering and numbers with navy pinstripes. A white/gray/white stripe is on each sleeve as well as the collared V-neck, and a Cowboys star logo is placed upon the stripes. A \"Cowboys\" chest crest is directly under the NFL shield. The away pants are a pearlish metallic-silver color (PMS 8180 C) and like the home pants, enhance the navy in the uniforms. The team uses a serifed font for the lettered player surnames on the jersey nameplates.<ref name=\"CowboysMediaGuide\"/><ref name=\"CowboysTeamCapsule\" />\n\nThe team's helmets are also a unique silver with a tint of blue known as \"Metallic Silver Blue\" (PMS 8240 C) and have a blue/white/blue vertical stripe placed upon the center of the crown. The Cowboys also include a unique, if subtle, feature on the back of the helmet: a blue strip of [[Dymo]] tape with the player's name embossed, placed on the white portion of the stripe at the back of the helmet.\n\n====Home and away uniform history====\n{{multiple image\n|align = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|total_width= 400\n|header = 1960 uniforms\n|image1 = Dallas Cowboys helmet 1960.jpg\n|caption1 = Helmet\n|image2 = Cowboys blue uniform 1960.jpg\n|caption2 = Blue home \n|image3 = Cowboys white uniform 1960.jpg\n|caption3 = White away\n|footer = \n}}\n{{multiple image\n|align = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|total_width= 400\n|header = 1964 uniforms\n|image1 = Dallas Cowboys helmet 1964.jpg\n|caption1 = Helmet\n|image2 = Cowboys white uniform 1964.jpg\n|caption2 = White home\n|image3 = Cowboys blue uniform 1964.jpg\n|caption3 = Blue away\n|footer = \n}}\nWhen the Dallas Cowboys franchise debuted in 1960, the team's uniform included a white helmet adorned with a simple blue star and a blue-white-blue stripe down the center crown. The team donned blue jerseys with white sleeves and a small blue star on each shoulder for home games and the negative opposite for away games. Their socks also had two horizontal white stripes overlapping the blue.\n\nIn 1964, the Cowboys opted for a simpler look (adopting essentially the team's current uniform) by changing their jersey/socks to one solid color with three horizontal stripes on the sleeves; the white jersey featured royal blue stripes with a narrow black border, the royal blue jersey white stripes with the same black outline. The star-shouldered jerseys were eliminated; \"TV\" numbers appeared just above the jersey stripes. The new helmet was silver-blue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe down the center (the middle white stripe was thicker). The blue \"lone star\" logo was retained, but with a white border setting it off from the silver/blue. The new pants were silver/blue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe. In 1964, the NFL allowed teams to wear white jerseys at home; several teams did so, and the Cowboys have worn white at home ever since, except on certain and special \"throwback\" days.<ref name=\"Morgan\">{{Cite web |last=Morgan |first=Chris |date=October 25, 2021 |title=Why Do the Dallas Cowboys Always Wear White at Home? |url=https://fanbuzz.com/nfl/dallas-cowboys-colors/ |access-date=February 6, 2024 |website=FanBuzz |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Jarden |first=Sam |date=December 29, 2022 |title=Cowboys all-white uniforms, explained: What to know about 'Arctic Cowboys' alternate helmets, jerseys |url=https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/cowboys-white-uniforms-helmets/nnu5ooutg45ou511ivgofudf |access-date=February 6, 2024 |website=Sporting News |language=en-us}}</ref><ref name=\"u873\">{{cite web | title=Why Are the Dallas Cowboys Wearing Blue Jerseys at Home? | website=Pro Football Network | date=2023-11-23 | url=https://www.profootballnetwork.com/why-are-dallas-cowboys-wearing-blue-jerseys-at-home-nfl-2023/ | access-date=2024-08-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the team modified the jerseys, which now featured only two sleeve stripes, slightly wider; the socks followed the same pattern. In 1967 the \"lone star\" helmet decal added a blue outline to the white-bordered star, giving the logo a bigger, bolder look. The logo and this version of the uniform have seen little change to the present day.\n\nThe only notable changes from 1970 to the present were:\n\n* 1970 to 1973: The \"TV\" numbers were moved from the shoulders to the sleeves above the stripes (the TV numbers returned to the shoulders on the white jerseys in 1974, but remained on the sleeves of the blue jerseys through 1978).\n* 1982 to 1988: The pants featured a white uniform number in an elliptical blue circle worn near the hip.\n* the removal of the indented [[serif]]s on the front and back jersey numbers in the early 1980s (seen currently on the throwback jersey)\n* 1980: The blue jersey was rendered in a slightly darker shade than the 1964\u201379 version; from 1981 to 1994 the dark jerseys sported numbers that were gray with white borders and a blue pinstripe. The stripes on the sleeves and socks also used the same gray with white border scheme (sans navy pinstripe).\n* 1982 to present: Player names on jersey backs, which were originally in block-letter style, were slightly smaller and in a footed \"serif\" style.\n* 1996 to present: The blue jersey features white/gray/white stripes on each sleeve and the collared V-neck, the Cowboys star logo placed upon the sleeve stripes, white lettering and numbers with navy pinstripes, and the \"Cowboys\" wordmark in the center of the neckline. The \"Cowboys\" wordmark was also placed at that same spot on the white jersey from 1996 to 1998.\n\nDuring the 1976 season, the blue-white-blue stripe on the crown of the helmets was temporarily changed to red-white-blue to commemorate the United States' bicentennial anniversary. This stripe configuration returned in 2021 and is now worn for one regular season game annually when the team pays tribute to [[Medal of Honor]] recipients.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Breech |first=John |date=2022-12-04 |title=LOOK: Cowboys set to wear rare red stripe on their helmet for just the second time in 46 years and here's why |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/look-cowboys-set-to-wear-rare-red-stripe-on-their-helmet-for-just-the-second-time-in-46-years-and-heres-why/ |access-date=2024-08-28 |website=CBSSports.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, the NFL celebrated their 75th Anniversary, and the Dallas Cowboys celebrated their back-to-back Super Bowl titles by unveiling a white \"Double-Star\" jersey on Thanksgiving Day. This jersey was used for special occasions and was worn throughout the 1994\u201395 playoffs. During the same season, the Cowboys also wore their 1960\u201363 road jersey with a silver helmet for one game as part of a league-wide \"throwback\" policy.\n\nDuring the 1995 season, the team wore the navy \"Double-Star\" jersey for games at Washington and Philadelphia and permanently switched to solid color socks (royal blue for the white uniform, and navy blue for the dark uniform). The navy \"Double-Star\" jersey was not seen again until the NFL's ''Classic Throwback Weekend'' on Thanksgiving Day 2001\u20132003.\n\nIn 2004, the Cowboys resurrected their original 1960\u20131963 uniform on Thanksgiving Day. This uniform became the team's alternate or \"third jersey\" and was usually worn at least once a year, primarily Thanksgiving Day. Two exceptions were when the Cowboys wore their normal white uniforms on Thanksgiving in 2007 and 2008. While the team didn't wear the throwback uniform exactly on Thanksgiving Day in those two years, Dallas wore them on a date around Thanksgiving for those two years. In 2007 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 29, 2007, against the Green Bay Packers. In 2008 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 23, 2008, against the San Francisco 49ers. The team went back to wearing this uniform at home on Thanksgiving Day in 2009 while their opponent was the Oakland Raiders who wore their AFL Legacy Weekend throwbacks. Dallas wore this alternate uniform on October 11, 2009, as part of one of the NFL's AFL Legacy Weekends when they traveled to Kansas City to play the Chiefs who were sporting their AFL Dallas Texans' uniforms. This created a rare game in which neither team wore a white jersey and the first time the Cowboys wore the alternative uniform as a visiting team. The 1960\u20131963 uniform may also be used on other special occasions. Other instances include the 2005 Monday Night game against the Washington Redskins when the team inducted Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irving into the Cowboys Ring of Honor, and the 2006 Christmas Day game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn 2013, the NFL issued a new helmet rule stating that players would no longer be allowed to use alternate helmets due to the league's enhanced concussion awareness. This caused the Cowboys' white 1960s throwback helmets to become non-compliant. However, this rule became moot in 2022 when the NFL once again allowed teams to use an alternate helmet again, and the Cowboys reintroduced the 1960s white helmet.\n\nDuring the \"one-shell era\", in 2013,<ref>{{citation|title=2013 Thanksgiving Day uniforms|url=https://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/controller/controller.php?action=bottom-bar-pages&game-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Game&page-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Games&year=2013|publisher=The Gridiron Uniforms Database|access-date=July 31, 2022}}</ref> 2014,<ref>{{citation|title=2014 Thanksgiving Day uniforms|url=https://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/controller/controller.php?action=bottom-bar-pages&game-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Game&page-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Games&year=2014|publisher=The Gridiron Uniforms Database|access-date=July 31, 2022}}</ref> 2016,<ref>{{citation|title=2016 Thanksgiving Day uniforms|url=https://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/controller/controller.php?action=bottom-bar-pages&game-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Game&page-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Games&year=2016|publisher=The Gridiron Uniforms Database|access-date=July 31, 2022}}</ref> and 2017,<ref>{{citation|title=2017 Thanksgiving Day uniforms|url=https://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/controller/controller.php?action=bottom-bar-pages&game-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Game&page-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Games&year=2017|publisher=The Gridiron Uniforms Database|access-date=July 31, 2022}}</ref> the team wore their normal blue jerseys at home for Thanksgiving; the only exceptions were in 2015<ref>{{citation|title=2015 Thanksgiving Day uniforms|url=https://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/controller/controller.php?action=bottom-bar-pages&game-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Game&page-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Games&year=2015|publisher=The Gridiron Uniforms Database|access-date=July 31, 2022}}</ref> and 2020<ref>{{citation|title=2020 Thanksgiving Day uniforms|url=https://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/controller/controller.php?action=bottom-bar-pages&game-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Game&page-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Games&year=2020|publisher=The Gridiron Uniforms Database|access-date=July 31, 2022}}</ref> when the Cowboys wore the \"Color Rush\" uniforms (''see below''), and in 2018,<ref>{{citation|title=2018 Thanksgiving Day uniforms|url=https://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/controller/controller.php?action=bottom-bar-pages&game-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Game&page-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Games&year=2018|publisher=The Gridiron Uniforms Database|access-date=July 31, 2022}}</ref> 2019<ref>{{citation|title=2019 Thanksgiving Day uniforms|url=https://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/controller/controller.php?action=bottom-bar-pages&game-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Game&page-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Games&year=2019|publisher=The Gridiron Uniforms Database|access-date=July 31, 2022}}</ref> and 2021<ref>{{citation|title=2021 Thanksgiving Day uniforms|url=https://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/GUD/controller/controller.php?action=bottom-bar-pages&game-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Game&page-title=Thanksgiving%20Day%20Games&year=2021|publisher=The Gridiron Uniforms Database|access-date=July 31, 2022}}</ref> when they wore their regular white uniforms.<ref name=\"2013BlueJerseys\">{{cite web|last=Eatman|first=Nick|title=Cowboys To Wear Blue Jerseys At Home Thursday|url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/cowboys-to-wear-blue-jerseys-at-home-thursday-344596|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DallasCowboys.com|date=November 26, 2013|access-date=September 3, 2019|archive-date=September 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903220857/https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/cowboys-to-wear-blue-jerseys-at-home-thursday-344596|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2017, the team initially announced that they will wear blue jerseys at home on a more regular basis, only to rescind soon after.<ref name=\"HanzusCowboys\" /><ref name=\"DaSilvaCowboys\">{{cite news|last=DaSilva|first=Cameron|title=Here's the real reason behind the Dallas Cowboys' mismatched uniform colors|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/dallas-cowboys-nfl-uniforms-mismatched-gray-blue-home-away-throwback-thanksgiving-changes-061317|work=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=June 13, 2017|access-date=August 25, 2017|archive-date=August 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826031452/http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/dallas-cowboys-nfl-uniforms-mismatched-gray-blue-home-away-throwback-thanksgiving-changes-061317|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the Cowboys released their [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform, featuring a variation of the 1990s \"Double Star\" alternates with white pants and socks.

(Many believe Trapasso was trying to hit the suspended scoreboard, based on replays and the angle of the kick.) The scoreboard is, however, within the regulation of the NFL guidelines \u2013 hanging approximately five feet above the minimum height. No punts hit the scoreboard during the entire 2009 regular season during an actual game. Also, on August 22, 2009, the day after AJ Trapasso hit the screen, many fans touring the facility noted that half of the field was removed with large cranes re-positioning the screen. According to some fans, a tour guide explained that Jerry Jones invited a few professional soccer players to drop kick soccer balls to try to hit the screen. Once he observed them hitting it consistently he had the screen moved up another 10 feet.\n\nThe first regular season home game of the 2009 season was against the New York Giants.

A series of other factors heightened tensions during the 1980s and 1990s, including several provocative actions by Philadelphia fans and Eagles head coach [[Buddy Ryan]]. Among these were the 1989 [[Bounty Bowl]]s in which Ryan allegedly placed a bounty on Dallas kicker [[Luis Zendejas]] and [[Veterans Stadium]] fans pelted the Cowboys with snowballs and other debris.\n\nA 1999 game in [[Philadelphia]] saw Eagles fans cheering as [[Michael Irvin]] lay motionless on the field at [[Veterans Stadium]]. In 2008, the rivalry became more intense when in the last game of the year in which both teams could clinch a playoff spot with a victory, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Cowboys 44\u20136. The following season, the Cowboys avenged that defeat by beating the Eagles three times: twice during the regular season to claim the title as NFC East champions and once more in a wild-card playoff game by a combined score of 78\u201330, including a 24\u20130 shutout in week 17. That three-game sweep was Dallas' first over any opponent and the longest winning streak against the Eagles since 1992\u20131995 when Dallas won seven straight matches against Philadelphia.\n\nDuring the 2013 season, Dallas won the first meeting 17\u20133 at [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in Philadelphia. The two teams met again in Week 17 at AT&T Stadium with the winner clinching the 2013 NFC East title. The Cowboys came into the game at a disadvantage with starting quarterback [[Tony Romo]] out with a season-ending back injury, which put backup [[Kyle Orton]] as the starter. It was a tight game with the Eagles up 24\u201322 with less than 2 minutes to go in regulation. Orton got the ball and started driving down the field when he was intercepted by the Eagles defense, which ended the game and the Cowboys season. In 2014, the Cowboys and Eagles both won against each other on the road with Philadelphia posting a dominant 33\u201310 win on [[National Football League on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] in Dallas, and Dallas returning the favor two weeks later by defeating the Eagles 38\u201327 at [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in Philadelphia. The second game between these rivals clinched a playoff spot for Dallas and led to formerly first-place Philadelphia missing out on the post-season.

Dallas logged its first win in the series on October 29, 1961, and New York's first was on November 11, 1962. Among the more notable moments in the rivalry was the Giants' defeat of Dallas in the 2007 playoffs en route to their victory in [[Super Bowl XLII]] and winning the first regular-season game played at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in 2009.

The two teams' storied on-field rivalry goes back to 1960 when the two clubs first played each other, resulting in a 26\u201314 Washington victory. Since that time, the two teams have met in 126 regular-season contests and two NFC Championships. Dallas leads the regular season all-time series 78\u201346\u20132, and Washington leads the all-time playoff series 2\u20130.<ref>{{Cite web |title=All Matchups, Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=dal&tm2=was&yr=all |access-date=2024-08-05 |website=[[Pro Football Reference]] |language=en}}</ref> The Cowboys currently have a 14\u20137 advantage over Washington at FedEx Field. Some notable moments in the rivalry include Washington's victory over Dallas in the 1982 NFC Championship and the latter's 1989 win over Washington for their only victory that season. The last Cowboys game with Tom Landry as coach was a win over Washington on December 11, 1988. In the 2010s, Washington has struggled to consistently compete for the Division title, but still play the Cowboys particularly tough, posting an impressive upset victory against Dallas in 2014, despite being outclassed by the Cowboys in the overall standings. The 2010s also included an important game in week 17 of 2012 which saw Washington defeat Dallas 28\u201318 to win the NFC East.\n\n===Conference===\n====San Francisco 49ers====\n{{main|49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry}}\nThe bitter rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and [[San Francisco 49ers]] has been going on since the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Munoz |first=Michelle |date=August 27, 2009 |title=Cowboys-49ers: A Rivalry for the Ages |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/243616-cowboys-49ers-a-rivalry-for-the-ages |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012084352/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/243616-cowboys-49ers-a-rivalry-for-the-ages |archive-date=October 12, 2013 |access-date=November 4, 2013 |website=Bleacher Report}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninersnation.com/2010/5/16/1474508/the-greatest-rivalries-in-the-nfl#comments |title=The Greatest Rivalries in the NFL: 49ers-Cowboys |date=May 16, 2010 |publisher=Niners Nation |access-date=November 4, 2013 |archive-date=October 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012040447/http://www.ninersnation.com/2010/5/16/1474508/the-greatest-rivalries-in-the-nfl#comments |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[NFL Top 10]] ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in the history of the NFL. San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC Championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC Championship Game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' [[Joe Montana]] complete a game-winning pass to [[Dwight Clark]] in the final minute (now known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]]) is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC Championship Game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are tied for third all-time in [[Super Bowl]] victories to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and New England Patriots, with five each. The 49ers-Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas.

Instead, the team has a [[Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor|\"Ring of Honor\"]], which is on permanent display encircling the field. Originally at Texas Stadium, the ring is now on display at [[AT&T Stadium]] in Arlington. The first inductee was Bob Lilly in 1975 and by 2005, the ring contained 17 names, all former Dallas players except for one head coach and one general manager/president.\n\nThe Ring of Honor has been a source of controversy over the years. Tex Schramm was believed to be a \"one-man committee\" in choosing inductees and many former Cowboys players and fans felt that Schramm deliberately excluded linebacker [[Lee Roy Jordan]] because of a bitter contract dispute the two had during Jordan's playing days. When Jerry Jones bought the team he inherited Schramm's Ring of Honor \"power\" and immediately inducted Jordan.\n\nJones also has sparked controversy regarding his decisions in handling the \"Ring of Honor\". For four years he was unsuccessful in convincing Tom Landry to accept induction. Meanwhile, he refused to induct Tex Schramm (even after Schramm's induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame). In 1993, thanks in part to the efforts of Roger Staubach as an intermediary, Landry accepted induction and had a ceremony on the day of that year's Cowboys-Giants game (Landry had played and coached for the Giants). In 2003, Jones chose to induct Tex Schramm. Schramm and Jones held a joint press conference at Texas Stadium announcing the induction. Unfortunately, Schramm did not live to see his ceremonial induction at the Cowboys-Eagles game that fall.\n\nTroy Aikman, all-time NFL leading rusher Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin, known as \"The Triplets,\" were inducted into the Ring of Honor during halftime at a Monday Night Football home game against the archrival Washington Redskins on September 19, 2005.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2005-09-20 |title='Triplets' honored: Aikman, Emmitt, Irvin in Dallas' Ring |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2166604 |access-date=2024-08-24 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nDefensive end [[Charles Haley]], offensive lineman [[Larry Allen]], and wide receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] were inducted into the Ring of Honor during halftime of the Cowboys' game vs. the [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] on November 6, 2011.<ref name=\"j961\">{{cite web | title=Pearson, Haley, Allen going to Cowboys' Ring of Honor | website=NFL.com | date=2011-08-19 | url=https://www.nfl.com/news/pearson-haley-allen-going-to-cowboys-ring-of-honor-09000d5d821972a8 | access-date=2024-08-05}}</ref>\n\nSafety [[Darren Woodson]] was inducted on November 1, 2015.<ref name=\"h811\">{{cite web | last=Archer | first=Todd | title=Darren Woodson's Ring of Honor dream comes true | website=ESPN.com | date=2015-08-04 | url=https://www.espn.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4743838/darren-woodsons-ring-of-honor-dream-comes-true | access-date=2024-08-05}}</ref> Executive [[Gil Brandt]] was inducted on November 29, 2018.<ref name=\"v788\">{{cite web | title=Gil Brandt Announced Into Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor | website=DallasCowboys.com | date=2018-11-02 | url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/photos/gil-brandt-announced-into-dallas-cowboys-ring-of-honor | access-date=2024-08-05}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent inductees were [[DeMarcus Ware]], who was inducted on October 29, 2023, and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], who was inducted on December 30, 2023.<ref name=\"x244\">{{cite web | last=Boykins | first=William A. | title=DeMarcus Ware inducted into the Ring of Honor | website=Dallas Cowboys | date=2023-10-29 | url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/demarcus-ware-inducted-into-the-ring-of-honor#:~:text=Ware%20becomes%20the%20ninth%20defensive,Ware%2C%20the%20No. | access-date=2024-08-05}}</ref><ref name=\"u575\">{{cite web | last=Eatman | first=Nick | title=Jimmy Johnson opens up about Ring of Honor induction | website=Dallas Cowboys | date=2023-12-31 | url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/news/jimmy-johnson-opens-up-about-ring-of-honor-induction | access-date=2024-08-05}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#cfecec;
