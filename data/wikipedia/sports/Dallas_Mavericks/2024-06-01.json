The Mavericks compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]]. The team plays its home games at the [[American Airlines Center]], which it shares with the [[NHL]]'s [[Dallas Stars]].\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the Mavericks were a perennial playoff team, led by [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Stars]] [[Rolando Blackman]] and [[Mark Aguirre]]. The team struggled during the 1990s, entering into a period of rebuilding. In 1998, the franchise's fortunes would change drastically with the acquisition of [[Dirk Nowitzki]], who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history, leading the team to its first [[NBA Finals]] appearance in [[2006 NBA Finals|2006]] and its only NBA championship in [[2011 NBA Finals|2011]]. \n\nThe Mavericks later entered a rebuilding phase in the tail end of Nowitzki's storied career; although they missed the playoffs in three consecutive years from [[2016\u201317 NBA season|2017]] to [[2018\u201319 NBA season|2019]] (after which Nowitzki retired following his [[List of NBA players who have spent their entire career with one franchise|record-breaking 21st season]] with Dallas), the franchise's fortunes immediately rebounded once again with the acquisition of [[Luka Don\u010di\u0107]] (who was named the [[2019 NBA Awards|2019 Rookie of the Year]]); the Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 2020, reached the [[NBA Western Conference finals|Western Conference finals]] in 2022 for the first time since their 2011 championship, and reached their third NBA Finals in [[2024 NBA Finals|2024]].\n\nIn February 2020, the Mavericks sold out their NBA-record 815th consecutive game, dating back to December 15, 2001. The sellout streak, which includes 67 playoff games, is the longest currently running in North American major league sports.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/doylerader/2020/02/21/dallas-mavericks-break-nba-consecutive-sellout-record/|title=Dallas Mavericks Break The NBA's Consecutive Sellout Record|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=May 16, 2022|archive-date=May 16, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220516192836/https://www.forbes.com/sites/doylerader/2020/02/21/dallas-mavericks-break-nba-consecutive-sellout-record/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince the Mavericks' [[1980\u201381 Dallas Mavericks season|inaugural 1980\u201381 season]], the Mavericks have won five division titles ([[1986\u201387 NBA season|1987]], [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2007]], [[2009\u201310 NBA season|2010]], [[2020\u201321 NBA season|2021]], [[2023\u201324 NBA season|2024]]), three conference championships ([[2006 NBA Finals|2006]], [[2011 NBA Finals|2011]], [[2024 NBA Finals|2024]]) and one [[NBA championship]] ([[2011 NBA Finals|2011]]).\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main|History of the Dallas Mavericks}}\n{{See also|List of Dallas Mavericks seasons}}\n\n===1978\u20131981: The creation and early years of the Mavericks===\nIn 1978, Californian businessman Garn Eckardt met [[Dallas]] lawyer Doug Adkins and mentioned he was trying to raise capital to move an NBA team to Dallas. Asking for a possible partner, Adkins recommended him one of his clients, [[Home Interiors and Gifts]] owner [[Don Carter (businessman)|Don Carter]]. Negotiations with Eckardt fell through, but Carter remained interested in the enterprise as a gift to his wife Linda, who played basketball while at [[Duncanville High School]]. Simultaneously, [[Buffalo Braves]] president and general manager Norm Sonju developed an interest in bringing the NBA to Dallas as he studied possible new locations for the ailing franchise. While the Braves went to California as the [[Los Angeles Clippers#1978\u20131984: San Diego Clippers|San Diego Clippers]], Sonju eventually returned to Texas. He was introduced to Carter by Mayor [[Robert Folsom]], one of the owners and team president of the last professional basketball team in the city, the Dallas Chaparrals of the [[American Basketball Association]], which moved to [[San Antonio]] in 1973 becoming the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. Sonju and Carter tried purchasing both the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] and the [[Kansas City Kings]], but disagreement on relocation stalled the negotiations, leading them to instead aim for an [[expansion team]].\n\nThe league was initially reluctant to expand to Dallas, given Texas had both the Spurs and [[Houston Rockets]]. The [[1978\u201379 NBA season|1978\u201379 season]] was proving unprofitable (18 out of the 22 teams lost money) and unpopular (television ratings fell 26 percent). Still, during the [[1979 NBA All-Star Game]] weekend, [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA commissioner]] [[Larry O'Brien]] announced the league would add two new teams in the [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1980\u201381 season]], with teams in Dallas and [[Minneapolis]]. Once the potential Minnesota owners backed out, only Dallas remained. (The [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] would not join until 1989.) Through negotiations with general counselor and future commissioner [[David Stern]], the expansion fee was settled on $12.5&nbsp;million. Carter would provide half the amount.<ref>{{cite web|last=Townsend|first=Brad|title=Archive: A look back at the birth of the Dallas Mavericks|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-mavericks/headlines/20130501-archive-a-look-back-at-the-birth-of-the-dallas-mavericks.ece|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=May 1, 2005|access-date=August 16, 2015|archive-date=September 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924124050/http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-mavericks/headlines/20130501-archive-a-look-back-at-the-birth-of-the-dallas-mavericks.ece|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-mavericks/headlines/20140130-david-stern-goes-way-back-with-mavericks-mark-cuban-praises-outgoing-commish-seriously.ece|title=David Stern goes way back with Mavericks; Mark Cuban praises outgoing commish (seriously)|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-date=September 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924124059/http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-mavericks/headlines/20140130-david-stern-goes-way-back-with-mavericks-mark-cuban-praises-outgoing-commish-seriously.ece|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1980 NBA All-Star Game]], league owners voted to admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957\u20131962 TV western [[Maverick (TV series)|''Maverick'']]; the fans chose the title with 4,600 postcards received, beating ''Wranglers'' and ''Express''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind The Name \u2013 Dallas Mavericks |url=http://www.nba.com/mavericks/history/behind_the_name_06.html|website=Mavs.com|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|date=December 31, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226045338/http://www.nba.com/mavericks/history/behind_the_name_06.html|archive-date=December 26, 2007|access-date=August 16, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Scott|title=The Origins of All 30 NBA Team Names|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/23115/origins-all-30-nba-team-names|work=[[Mental Floss]]|date=October 27, 2009|access-date=August 16, 2015|archive-date=August 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150809134149/http://mentalfloss.com/article/23115/origins-all-30-nba-team-names|url-status=live}}</ref> [[James Garner]], who played the title character, was a member of the ownership group.<ref>{{cite web | last = Woodward | first = Danny | author-link = Danny Woodward | title = In Metroplex, a tale of two Mavericks | publisher = [[ESPN]] | date = May 31, 2011 | url = http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?sportCat=nba&page=woodward%2F110531_dallas_mavericks_nickname | access-date = October 26, 2021 | archive-date = October 26, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211026175926/http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?sportCat=nba&page=woodward%2F110531_dallas_mavericks_nickname | url-status = live }}</ref> The [[Texas-Arlington Mavericks|University of Texas at Arlington]], who also uses [[Texas\u2013Arlington Mavericks|the Mavericks nickname]], had objections about a shared name but did not attempt any legal action.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=woodward%2F110531_dallas_mavericks_nickname|title=Not all Metroplex Mavericks fans are excited about Dallas Mavericks' success|publisher=ESPN|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-date=April 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402200139/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=woodward%2F110531_dallas_mavericks_nickname|url-status=live}}</ref> They joined the Midwest Division of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]], where they would stay until the league went to six divisions for the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]].

Still, VanDeWeghe refused to play for the expansion Mavericks and staged a holdout that lasted a month into its inaugural season. VanDeWeghe was traded to the [[Denver Nuggets]], along with a first-round pick, in 1981, in exchange for two future first-round picks that eventually materialized into [[Rolando Blackman]] in [[1981 NBA draft|1981]], and [[Sam Vincent]] in [[1985 NBA draft|1985]].\n\n[[File:Don Carter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mavs' founder [[Don Carter (businessman)|Don Carter]]]]\nIn the Mavericks debut game, taking place in the brand-new [[Reunion Arena]], the Mavericks defeated the Spurs, 103\u201392. But the Mavs started the season with a 6\u201340 record on their way to finishing 15\u201367. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a significant role in the early years of their franchise. Journeyman 6&nbsp;ft 3 in guard [[Brad Davis (basketball)|Brad Davis]], who played for the [[Anchorage Northern Knights]] of the [[Continental Basketball Association]], was tracked down and signed by the Mavericks in December after a scout watched a game with Davis. He had to be convinced to play for the team rather than attend to his studies at the [[University of Maryland]] (which he was funding by playing for Anchorage).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.mavs.com/mavs-com-braddavis/ | title=Brad Davis had fairytale career with Mavs, ending with jersey retirement | date=May 4, 2020 | access-date=May 9, 2022 | archive-date=May 31, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220531081802/https://www.mavs.com/mavs-com-braddavis/ | url-status=live }}</ref> He would play for the remainder of the season after joining in December. Davis would spend the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually, his number 15 jersey was retired. The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a good debut season, with 7,789 spectators per game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-10/sports/sp-2289_1_texas-football/2|title=In Texas, Winning Is the Name of the Game|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 10, 1986 |access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-date=April 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402205026/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-10/sports/sp-2289_1_texas-football/2|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe 1981 NBA Draft brought three players who would become vital parts of the team. The Mavs selected forward [[Mark Aguirre]] with the first pick, guard [[Rolando Blackman]] ninth, and forward [[Jay Vincent]] at 24th. By the end of his seven-year Mavericks career, Aguirre would average 24.6 points per game. Blackman contributed 19.2 points over his 11-year career in Dallas. But it was Jay Vincent who made the most significant difference for the Mavs in their second season, leading the team in scoring with 21.4 points per game and earning NBA All-Rookie Team honors. The Mavericks improved to 28\u201354, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished above the [[Utah Jazz]].\n\n===1982\u20131990: Playoff contention===\nIn [[1982\u201383 NBA season|1982\u201383]], the Mavericks were serious contenders for the first time. At the [[1983 NBA All-Star Game|All-Star break]], they were 25\u201324 and had won 12 of their last 15 games. They could not sustain that momentum and finished seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. But the Mavs' 38\u201344 record was a 10-game improvement from the previous season.\n\nMark Aguirre led the 1982\u201383 Mavericks with 24.4 points per game, finishing sixth in the NBA. [[Jay Vincent]] and [[Rolando Blackman]] contributed 18.7 and 17.7 points per game, respectively. Brad Davis was 10th in the NBA in assists with 7.2 per game and shot .845 from the free-throw line, sixth in the league. The Mavs drafted [[Derek Harper]] with the 11th pick of the [[1983 NBA draft]]. The 6&nbsp;ft 4 in guard would spend the next decade with the organization, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists. The Mavericks' in [[1983\u201384 NBA season|1983\u201384]] posted a winning record for the first time in franchise history, finishing 43\u201339 and second in the Midwest Division. The Mavs also earned the first playoff berth in franchise history. Mark Aguirre was named the team's first NBA All-Star, as he finished with an average of 29.5 points per game\u2014second in the league to Utah's [[Adrian Dantley]].\n\nDallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and in their first playoff trip, they defeated the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in five games. The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at [[Moody Coliseum]], as Reunion Arena, then the home court for the Mavericks was hosting a tennis tournament. The [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[1983\u201384 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]], were next for the Mavs, and the young club fell short, losing four games to one. But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984 because they owned [[Cleveland Cavaliers|Cleveland]]'s first-round pick, which ended up being the fourth pick overall. The Mavs used it to select forward-center [[Sam Perkins]], a former [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heel]], with a surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas.\n\nAbout this time, the [[Dallas Cowboys]], once one of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s elite teams, began a slow decline that eventually saw them fall to 1\u201315 in [[1989 Dallas Cowboys season|1989]]. The Mavs were hitting their stride simultaneously and replaced the Cowboys as the Metroplex's most popular team. The [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984\u201385]] team finished a game better than the previous year at 44\u201338. Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, [[Sam Perkins]] made the All-Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the [[1985 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Mavs returned to the [[1985 NBA playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1985]] but were not as successful as they had been. They won Game 1 in double-overtime against the [[1984\u201385 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in their first-round playoff series, but lost the next three games in a row, ending their season.\n\nDallas had the eighth pick in the [[1985 NBA draft]]\u2014again due to a trade with the Cavaliers\u2014and drafted German-born forward [[Detlef Schrempf]] out of [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]]. He would show flashes of brilliance in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was not until he was traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center [[Kurt Nimphius]] to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] for center [[James Donaldson (basketball)|James Donaldson]], who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392 season]]. This trade allowed the Mavericks to have a steady hand at the center position lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson became the first Dallas Mavericks center in club history to be selected to play in the [[1988 NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]].\n\n[[Rolando Blackman]] represented the Mavericks in the [[1986 NBA All-Star Game]], hosted by Dallas at Reunion Arena. The 1985\u201386 Mavericks were second in scoring at 115.3 points per game, gaining their third-straight playoff appearance. They defeated [[1985\u201386 Utah Jazz season|Utah]] three games to one in the first round. In the conference semi-finals, they ran into the [[1985\u201386 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] again, and L.A. defeated Dallas in six games. But four of those games were decided by four points or fewer, and Dallas won half of those, leaving Mavericks fans room to hope that they could finally top the Lakers in the following season. The Mavs drafted [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] center [[Roy Tarpley]] with the seventh overall pick, who would become a very talented\u2014but troubled\u2014member of the roster.\n\nThe [[1986\u201387 NBA season|1986\u201387]] Mavericks team had their most successful regular season to date, going 55\u201327 and winning their first Midwest Division title. But despite the great expectations surrounding the team, they self-destructed in the playoffs. After hammering the [[1986\u201387 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]] by 22 points in Game 1, the bottom dropped out for the Mavs, as they lost Games 2 and 3 in close fashion before succumbing to Game 4 in [[Seattle]]. Following the unexpected early playoff exit, Motta, who had been with the team since its inception, shockingly resigned as head coach. [[John MacLeod (basketball)|John MacLeod]], who had led the [[Phoenix Suns]] to nine playoff berths in 11 seasons, including an NBA Finals run in 1976, was hired as his replacement.\n\nThe [[1987\u201388 NBA season]] saw the Mavericks dip just a little bit in the regular season\u2014finishing 53\u201329 and losing their Midwest Division title to the [[Denver Nuggets]]\u2014but it was another successful year for the team. [[Mark Aguirre]] and [[James Donaldson (basketball)|James Donaldson]] both played in the [[1988 NBA All-Star Game]], the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and [[Rolando Blackman]] scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and [[Roy Tarpley]] won the [[NBA Sixth Man Award]] with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the [[Houston Rockets]] in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion [[1987\u201388 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] between them and their first-ever trip to the [[1988 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle. Still, in the end, the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.\n\nDespite all the changes, the Mavs remained in contention. However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured [[patella]] tendon on March 10, 1989, and missed the rest of the season. The Mavericks were left understaffed, demoralized, and disheartened as they finished with a 38\u201344 record. It was their first losing season since 1982\u201383\u2014which was also the last time they missed the playoffs.\n\n[[File:Lipofsky Mark Aguirre.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Mark Aguirre was traded to the Detroit Pistons in 1989.]]\nThe Mavericks returned to the [[1990 NBA playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] with a 47\u201335 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos. On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for [[driving while intoxicated]] and resisting arrest. The team started 5\u20136, and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach [[Richie Adubato]]. The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs but went down rather meekly to the [[1989\u201390 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in three games. It would be the team's last winning season and playoff appearance until 2001.\n\n===1990\u20131998: Rebuilding===\n\n====1990\u20131994: Free falling====\nThe team endured numerous changes in 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391]] starting lineup. The players they managed to acquire\u2014[[Rodney McCray (basketball)|Rodney McCray]], [[Fat Lever]], and [[Alex English]]\u2014were all in the twilight of their careers. On November 9, it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own, which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28\u201354, falling behind even the second-year [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and [[Orlando Magic]]. In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of [[driving while intoxicated]] and was suspended again by the NBA.\n \t\t\nIt got even worse in [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392]]. Before the season even began, Tarpley violated the league's substance abuse policy for the third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season\u2014hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22\u201360 record.\n\nIn [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]], the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading [[Rolando Blackman]]\u2014who by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer\u2014to the [[New York Knicks]] for a first-round draft pick. Blackman had made four All-Star Game appearances in his Mavericks career. [[Herb Williams]] joined the Knicks as a free agent. Fat Lever underwent more surgery and missed the entire 1992\u201393 season. Derek Harper was the team's only bright spot, leading the team with 18.3 points per game.\n\nThe Mavericks selected [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] guard [[Jim Jackson (basketball)|Jim Jackson]] with the fourth overall pick of the [[1992 NBA draft]], but he and owner Donald Carter could not come to terms on a contract for half of his rookie season. Jackson only played 28 games in [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]], a season also ruined by trades, a coaching change, and injuries. The Mavericks started 2\u201327 and fired Adubato on January 13, replacing him with [[Gar Heard]]. The Mavericks came dangerously close to setting the all-time worst record in NBA history (at the time, 9\u201373 by the [[1972\u201373 NBA season|1972\u201373]] [[1972\u201373 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]). But when Jackson was signed on March 3, the Mavs rallied, closing the season with a 7\u201314 mark, including two straight wins to end the season and finishing 11\u201371, the second-worst record in NBA history.\n \t\t\nDallas selected [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] forward [[Jamal Mashburn]] with the fourth overall pick of the [[1993 NBA draft]] and hired [[Quinn Buckner]] as head coach. Buckner decided from the start to be a disciplinarian on the model of his college coach, [[Bobby Knight]], who told Buckner that the only way he would succeed with the Mavs would be to run the team with an iron hand.<ref name=Buckner>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-05-04-9405040137-story.html|title=Mavericks show Buckner door|author1=Sam Smith|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=May 4, 1994|access-date=January 2, 2021|archive-date=April 22, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422195445/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-05-04-9405040137-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The mostly young roster did not respond very well to Buckner's stern coaching style and started 1\u201323. By the end of January, they were 3\u201340, and it was once again possible that they could tie the 1973 Sixers for the all-time worst record in the league. But 5\u20139 records in February and April, coupled with Buckner loosening the reins a little bit, helped the Mavs finish 13\u201369. It was still the worst record in the league by far, but the Mavericks again avoided setting an all-time futility record. However, they did tie the NBA's ''single-season'' record for consecutive losses at [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|20 games]] (since broken).\n \t\t\nBuckner was fired at the end of the season despite having a five-year contract. However, Carter decided that Buckner had \"burned too many bridges\" due to his autocratic coaching style.<ref name=Buckner/> He compiled the worst record for a rookie NBA head coach, a record that only lasted four years until [[Bill Hanzlik]] broke it with the [[Denver Nuggets]]. The Mavericks brought back Dick Motta, who had led the franchise to some of its most successful seasons. The Mavericks also wound up with the number two pick in the [[1994 NBA draft]] and picked up [[California Golden Bears men's basketball|Cal]] point guard [[Jason Kidd]], giving them a solid tandem of Jackson, Mashburn, and Kidd, known as \"The Three Js.\"\n\n====1994\u20131996: Arrival of Jason Kidd====\nThe addition of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with new life in [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]]. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 7.7 assists in his rookie season and led the league in triple-doubles. [[Roy Tarpley]] was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February, which caused him to miss the regular season's remainder. Second-year forward [[Popeye Jones]] had a great year as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds.\n \t\t\nThe Mavericks' improvement was dramatic. The team jumped to 36\u201346, 10th in the Western Conference, and only five games behind the [[1994\u201395 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] for the eighth and final playoff spot. It was the most significant one-year improvement in the team's history and the highest in the NBA. Many{{Who|date=December 2014}} expected the Mavericks' improvement to continue with the franchise's first foray into the NBA playoffs since 1990. But despite a 4\u20130 start, the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]] was a disappointment about every conceivable way.{{According to whom|date=December 2014}} For the second time in his career, Roy Tarpley was given a lifelong ban from the NBA for repeated violations of the anti-drug policy\u2014he never played in the NBA again. Jamal Mashburn had season-ending surgery to repair his sore right knee, only 18 games into the Mavericks' schedule.\n \t\t\nThe team's two remaining stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson bickered throughout the season, though neither of them had trouble establishing his stardom. Jackson led the team scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers, and was the only Mav to start 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game and finished second in the league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. [[George McCloud]], who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history.\n\nOverall, the Mavericks connected on 735 of their 2,039 three-point attempts, both new league records. The Mavs finished 26\u201356, fifth in the Midwest Division, and 33 games out of first place. Motta was relieved of his head coaching responsibilities at season's end and replaced by former Bulls assistant coach [[Jim Cleamons]]. And Don Carter, the only owner the Mavericks had ever had, sold the team to a group of investors led by [[H. Ross Perot, Jr.]]\n\n====1996\u20131998: Arrival of Michael Finley====\n[[File:Bradley, Shawn (2008) 2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Shawn Bradley]] spent nine seasons with Dallas and ranks second all time in blocked shots.]] The [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]] was a year of transition for the Mavericks as they re-designed their entire team; 27 different players saw action for that Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over only rookie forward, [[Samaki Walker]], had remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, [[Loren Meyer]], and [[Tony Dumas]] were traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for guards [[Michael Finley]] and [[Sam Cassell]] and forward [[A.C. Green]]. Cassell would play just one season while Green played three, but Finley, who, after his first half-season in Dallas, went on to average over or near twenty points per game for at least the next seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game and played in each of the Mavericks games until the 2004\u201305 season.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/finlemi01.html | title=Michael Finley Stats | access-date=May 9, 2022 | archive-date=October 14, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014090640/http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/finlemi01.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n \t\t\n[[Don Nelson]] was hired as Dallas' general manager on February 7. Within a week of his hiring, the Mavericks had released [[Fred Roberts]] and [[Oliver Miller]]. They then traded Jamal Mashburn to the [[Miami Heat]] for forwards [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]] and [[Martin M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp]] and guard [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107|Sasha Danilovi\u0107]]. Thomas did not play in 1996\u201397 and only ended up playing in five games as a Maverick before signing as a free agent with the [[New York Knicks]]. Danilovi\u0107 played in 13 games for the Mavericks before opting out of his contract and signing with [[Virtus Bologna|Bucker Bologna]]. M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp played in 73 games for the Mavericks over the next two years before leaving the NBA.\n \t\t\n[[Chris Gatling]] was the Mavericks' sole representative in the NBA All-Star Game, but he did not last much longer in Dallas. In one of the most massive two-team trades in NBA history, the Mavericks traded Gatling, Jim Jackson, Sam Cassell, George McCloud, and [[Eric Montross]] to the [[New Jersey Nets]] for 7&nbsp;ft 6 in center [[Shawn Bradley]], forward [[Ed O'Bannon]], and guards [[Khalid Reeves]] and [[Robert Pack (basketball)|Robert Pack]]. Nelson claimed the trades were necessary because the situation in the locker room was unacceptable. However, whereas Cassell became a consistent floor leader, and Jackson, Gatling and, McCloud all continued to be substantial contributors to their teams for several more years, only Bradley lasted any time in Dallas. He would spend part of the next eight years putting up modest contributions for Dallas and giving them substantial numbers in blocked shots.\n\nUndrafted rookie guard [[Erick Strickland]] averaged 10.6 ppg. Along with Finley and Bradley, he was expected to be the core of this new Mavericks team. The constant changes made it impossible to establish any team chemistry in 1996\u201397, and the Mavericks finished 24\u201358. But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come. In 1997\u201398, despite a poor record of 20\u201362, Dallas had a knack for giving some of the NBA's elite teams a hard time to beat the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], [[New York Knicks]], [[Indiana Pacers]], and [[Chicago Bulls]]. Against the Bulls, Dallas went on a 17\u20132 run to force overtime, where they won 104\u201397. Midway through that season, Nelson fired Cleamons and named himself head coach.\n\n===1998\u20132019: The Dirk Nowitzki era===\n\n====1998\u20132001: New beginnings with Nowitzki & Nash====\n[[File:Dirk Nowitzki 2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Dirk Nowitzki was acquired by the Mavericks from the Milwaukee Bucks in 1998 and would become the face of the franchise in later years.]]\nIn the [[1998\u201399 NBA lockout|lockout-shortened]] [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]], the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19\u201331 record, but Michael Finley and [[Gary Trent]] put up substantial numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15\u201310) since 1989\u201390. Notable were the acquisitions of power forward [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and point guard [[Steve Nash]], two seemingly unspectacular moves that would significantly impact the future. In the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|following season]], the [[1999\u20132000 Dallas Mavericks season|team]] finally \"clicked\" and started to win consistently. Led by Finley, the Mavericks earned their first 40-win season since 1989\u201390. He was much helped by Nowitzki, who finally \"arrived\" in the NBA and established himself as a potent offensive threat.\n\nOn January 14, 2000, Ross Perot's group sold the Dallas Mavericks to Internet entrepreneur and season ticket-holder [[Mark Cuban]] for $285&nbsp;million. Cuban immediately set out to revitalize the Mavericks and increase the team's popularity in Dallas and nationwide. His controversial moves (he allowed [[Dennis Rodman]] to live in his house for a week before temporarily signing him) and outspoken personality quickly made him a fan favorite in Dallas. They garnered the team much press in the national media. He has also been fined millions of dollars for violating NBA rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/dallas/nba/story/_/id/10315836/mark-cuban-wish-granted-one-last-fine-david-stern-retires|title=Mark Cuban's wish granted with one last fine before David Stern retires|date=January 19, 2014|publisher=ESPN|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-date=April 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427224437/http://espn.go.com/dallas/nba/story/_/id/10315836/mark-cuban-wish-granted-one-last-fine-david-stern-retires|url-status=live}}</ref>\n \t\t\nIn [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]], the Mavericks improved further and finished with a 53\u201329 record fueled by Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash's offensive triangle. The Mavs made a trade minutes before the trade deadline that sent [[Hubert Davis]], [[Christian Laettner]], [[Courtney Alexander]], [[Loy Vaught]], and [[Etan Thomas]] to the [[Washington Wizards]] for [[Juwan Howard]], [[Calvin Booth]], and [[Obinna Ekezie]]. This move brought in fresh blood that secured the club's first playoff visit in 11 years. Also, [[Wang Zhizhi]] became the first Chinese player to play in the NBA, signing with the Mavs in January, along with Eduardo N\u00e1jera, bringing Dallas an international cast that included Canada's Nash and Germany's Nowitzki. Nowitzki was named to the All NBA Third Team, becoming the first Maverick receive an All NBA honor. In the [[2001 NBA playoffs|playoffs]], the Mavericks won in the first round against the [[Utah Jazz]]. They advanced to the second round for the first time since 1988. Even though the San Antonio Spurs eliminated them in five games, it marked a sense of optimism for Dallas in earnestly contending for an NBA title. This season was also the last in the old [[Reunion Arena]] before moving to the modern [[American Airlines Center]].\n\n====2001\u20132005: Run-and-gun Nellie ball====\n[[File:Victory Plaza 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Mavericks began playing at the [[American Airlines Center]] in 2001.]]\nThe [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]] was an excellent season for the Mavericks, with a 57\u201325 record and many sellout crowds. This season also saw a change in logo and colors, changing from the cowboy hat logo and green to a new horse logo and blue, almost on the same colors of fellow Dallas-based team, the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]]. Also, the team gained sleeker uniforms. Another blockbuster trade sent [[Juwan Howard]], [[Tim Hardaway]], and [[Donnell Harvey]] to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for [[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Nick Van Exel]], [[Tariq Abdul-Wahad]], and [[Avery Johnson]]. The Mavericks also made several attempts to sign the [[Utah Jazz]]'s star [[Karl Malone]]. The Mavericks swept the [[Kevin Garnett]]-led [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in the [[2002 NBA playoffs|2002 playoffs]] but lost again in the second round to the [[Chris Webber]]-led [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].\n\nBut it was only in the next season that the Mavericks finally broke through. The team started the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]] with a 14\u20130 record, which was one win shy of tying the NBA record set by the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]] [[1993\u201394 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] (15\u20130). The Mavericks finished with a 60\u201322 record in the regular season, impressing fans and critics with their sparkling offense. Since acquiring the \"Big Three\" of Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash, the Mavericks were a Western Conference power in waiting.<ref>{{cite news|title=Worst to First|url=http://www.nba.com/features/mavericks_timeline_030408.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=April 9, 2003|access-date=June 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618031126/http://www.nba.com/features/mavericks_timeline_030408.html|archive-date=June 18, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Finally, they led the team to the conference finals against the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. However, with the series tied 1\u20131, Dirk Nowitzki, the team's leading scorer, suffered a knee injury in game three that kept him out. This injury further worsened the Mavs' front-court depth problems (both of their backup centers were injured for the entire series), and the Spurs took the series in 6 games.\n\nIn [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]], two blockbuster trades were announced. The Mavericks acquired [[Antawn Jamison]], [[Danny Fortson]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch]], and [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]] from [[Golden State Warriors|Golden State]] in exchange for Nick Van Exel, [[Evan Eschmeyer]], Popeye Jones, [[Avery Johnson]], and [[Antoine Rigaudeau]]. Another high-profile trade sent Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, and Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch to Boston for [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Tony Delk]]. Although the team struggled with chemistry, the Mavericks comfortably qualified for the playoffs. With the trio Nowitzki-Finley-Nash and [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] Jamison, the Mavericks continued their reputation as the NBA's best offensive team. Notable were two rookies, [[Josh Howard]] and [[Marquis Daniels]], who made an immediate impact. However, the Mavericks were eliminated quickly in the [[2004 NBA playoffs|2004 playoffs]], losing in the first round to the [[Chris Webber]]-led [[Sacramento Kings]], a better defensive team. The Mavericks management had to re-evaluate their strategy.\n\nThe [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] saw trades which (among others) brought in robust center [[Erick Dampier]], combo guard [[Jason Terry]], speedy rookie point guard [[Devin Harris]], scoring machine [[Jerry Stackhouse]], and defensive stalwart [[Alan Henderson]]. Although the loss of All-Star Steve Nash via free agency visibly hurt the Mavericks' offense, the new acquisitions strengthened the team defense. The run-and-gun style of former times changed into a more balanced style of play. At the All-Star break, the Mavericks acquired [[Keith Van Horn]] for Calvin Booth and Henderson, the latter resigning only days later. Nowitzki added his third consecutive Euroscar during this season as well. On March 19, longtime coach Don Nelson stepped down, and his assistant Avery Johnson succeeded him. Under Johnson's tutelage, the Mavericks' defense became more vigorous, and they quickly qualified for the [[2005 NBA playoffs|2005 playoffs]] with an impressive 58\u201324 record. The Mavericks defeated the [[Houston Rockets]] in Round 1 of the playoffs in 7 games but then lost to the [[Phoenix Suns]] 4\u20132, led by former Maverick star [[Steve Nash]].\n\n====2005\u20132006: First finals appearance====\n{{Main|2005\u201306 Dallas Mavericks season}}\nBefore the [[2005 NBA draft]], the Mavericks had traded all their picks away and were left empty-handed. On August 15, 2005, veteran guard Michael Finley was waived under the new \"Allan Houston Rule.\"<ref>[http://www.dallasbasketball.com/morestories.asp?id=3286&NAV=1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920153034/http://www.dallasbasketball.com/morestories.asp?id=3286&NAV=1|date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> Under that rule, the [[Orlando Magic]] waived [[Doug Christie]], who then signed with the Mavericks. On August 19, the Mavericks held a press conference announcing they had re-signed [[Darrell Armstrong]] and introduced Christie, [[DeSagana Diop]], [[Rawle Marshall]], and [[Josh Powell]] as new Mavericks. Christie's playing time was minimal amid a surgically repaired ankle still hampering his play. He was waived on November 25, 2005. At the end of calendar 2005, Nowitzki achieved a rare double by winning both the Euroscar and [[Mr. Europa]], a second prestigious award for the top European player. He additionally was named the inaugural [[FIBA Europe Player of the Year Award|FIBA Europe Player of the Year]].\n\nUp until the very end of the season, the Mavericks were toe-to-toe with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for the crown of the Southwest Division and the #1 spot in the Western Conference. However, they fell short of the title and had to settle for a fourth seed. Nonetheless, they once again achieved a 60\u201322 record, with [[Avery Johnson]] winning [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|NBA Coach of the Year]] honors. They swept the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] in the [[2006 NBA playoffs|2006 playoffs]], leading to a titanic series against their state rivals and the reigning NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs. Five out of the seven games were decided in the last minute, including a Game 7 that had to go into overtime, with the Mavs prevailing under the guidance of [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and an incredibly deep bench. The Mavericks were able to advance to the conference finals against former teammate [[Steve Nash]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The Mavs' defense and depth enabled them to take the series as they defeated the [[Phoenix Suns]] in game 6 of the Western Conference finals on June 3, 2006, in the [[US Airways Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and the Mavs advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history.\n\n{{Main|2006 NBA Finals}}\nIn the NBA Finals, the Mavericks faced the [[2005\u201306 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], held the home-court advantage, and scored two convincing wins. After game 2, Dallas city officials had already planned the victory parade. However, in Game 3, the Mavs blew a late double-digit lead, courtesy of Heat guard [[Dwyane Wade]]. He carried the Heat to the win, with Nowitzki missing a potentially game-tying free throw in the last seconds. After getting blown out in Game 4, the Mavericks suffered another loss in Game 5 when Wade scored the game-tying basket in the final possession of regular time, putting the Heat ahead with last-second free throws in overtime. The [[tragic flaw|tragic figure]] was [[Josh Howard]], who missed a pair of clutch free throws in overtime and mistakenly called an early timeout, so the Mavs had to bring in the ball at backcourt rather than half-court for the last possession. In Game 6, the Mavericks took an early double-digit lead, but again, Wade poured in 36 points, helped by [[Alonzo Mourning]]'s five blocked shots, and the Mavericks lost their fourth game and the title after a string of botched three-pointers. Many Mavericks fans were stunned by the defeat. Mavericks owner [[Mark Cuban]] was fined a total of $250,000 for \"several acts of misconduct\" during the series, and Nowitzki was fined $5,000 for kicking a ball into the stands after Game 5. Nowitzki was also caught by TV cameras attacking a stationary bicycle in the hallway outside of the Mavericks locker room. [[Jerry Stackhouse]] was suspended for Game 5 after fouling [[Shaquille O'Neal]] on a breakaway dunk attempt. The latter marked the third time a Mavericks player was suspended in the 2006 playoffs.\n\nThe Mavericks became only the third team in NBA history (the first since 1977) to lose in the finals after taking a 2\u20130 lead. In Game 3, the Mavs held a 13-point lead under seven minutes remaining but were outscored 22\u20137 in the momentum-changing 98\u201396 defeat. The Heat's performance in the last seven minutes represented the team's most remarkable postseason comeback in team history.<ref>{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Brad|title=NBA.com: A Total Turnaround|url=http://www.nba.com/finals2006/heat_060620.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=June 20, 2006|access-date=August 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017120059/http://www.nba.com/finals2006/heat_060620.html|archive-date=October 17, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====2006\u20132007: Nowitzki wins MVP====\nAfter an end to their playoff run in 2006, the Mavericks sought retribution in the new season. After a 0\u20134 start, the Mavericks went on a historic run and posted a 52\u20135 record over their next 57 games. They finished the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|regular season]] with a record of 67\u201315, good enough to be tied for sixth place all-time, first in the league, and the number 1 seed in the [[2007 NBA playoffs|Western Conference playoffs]]. [[Dirk Nowitzki]] had a dominant season, further cementing his place as one of the game's elite players; he won his fifth consecutive Euroscar during the season and was named the NBA MVP at its end. [[Josh Howard]] was named to the all-star team.\n\nHowever, the first-place Mavericks were defeated in six games by the eighth-seeded [[2006\u201307 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]]. This outcome is regarded as one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playoffs2007/news/billrussell_postseason.html#070501|title=NBA.com: NBA.com Blog: Bill Russell| publisher=[[National Basketball Association]] |access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111103422/http://www.nba.com/playoffs2007/news/billrussell_postseason.html#070501|archive-date=January 11, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Mavs were exposed defensively, and the Warriors systematically dismantled the Mavericks by exploiting match-ups and preying on Dirk Nowitzki's weaknesses. The Mavericks went 67\u201312 against the rest of the league and 0\u20133 against Golden State on the year. The Warriors were coached by [[Don Nelson]], the immediate past manager and coach of the Mavericks. He had been appointed head coach of the Warriors in the 2006\u201307 mid-season.\n\nNowitzki's winning of regular season MVP honors and his team's first-round exit created an awkward dilemma regarding the MVP trophy ceremony. Traditionally, MVP awards are given to the winner in a ceremony between the first and second rounds of the playoffs. It is believed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2866994|title=Mavs' Nowitzki will receive MVP trophy next week|date=May 11, 2007|publisher=ESPN|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-date=October 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001015233/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2866994|url-status=live}}</ref> that the league opted to put some distance between the MVP presentation and the Mavericks' elimination against the Warriors. By the time Nowitzki collected his MVP award, nearly two weeks had elapsed since the Mavs were ousted.\n\n====2007\u20132008: The return of Jason Kidd====\n{{Main|2007\u201308 Dallas Mavericks season}}\n[[File: Jason Kidd drives Feb 24 2008.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kidd drives to the basket during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.]]\nThe Mavericks dealt [[Devin Harris]], two first-round picks, and others to the [[New Jersey Nets]] for veteran all-star [[Jason Kidd]] and other role players; Cuban also tried to acquire [[Kevin Garnett]] without success. The Mavericks were 3\u201311 against winning teams since the trade and lost Nowitzki for a little over a week due to a high ankle sprain injury. He returned April 2 in a crucial game against the [[2008\u201309 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] in a 111\u201386 Mavericks victory and helped defeat the [[2008\u201309 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in a 105\u201398 win on April 6. Dallas' win in Phoenix was especially significant because the Mavs had been nearly unable to defeat a contending team on the road the entire season. Continuing their playoff push, Dirk hit a crucial three-pointer with 0.9 seconds left, beating the [[2008\u201309 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]] 97\u201394 on April 10. This victory guaranteed them a playoff spot and their eighth consecutive 50-win season. The Mavericks ended the season with a record of 51\u201331. In the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks were eliminated by the New Orleans Hornets 4\u20131 on the road, 99\u201394.\n\nJust one day after a disappointing season ended, Avery Johnson was dismissed as head coach of the Dallas Mavericks. On May 9, 2008, [[Rick Carlisle]] was hired as the head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/050308dnspomavs.c4fc389e.html|title=Dallas Mavericks, Carlisle seem to like potential match \u2013 Dallas Mavericks News \u2013 Sports News \u2013 Dallas Morning News|access-date=May 5, 2013|archive-date=October 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028172607/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/050308dnspomavs.c4fc389e.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/050808dnspomavslede.da0f12fa.html|title=Deal with Dallas Mavericks, Carlisle could come today \u2013 WFAA.com \u2013 Sports: Basketball: Mavericks|access-date=May 9, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108022515/http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/050808dnspomavslede.da0f12fa.html|archive-date=January 8, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3389463|title=Mavs give Carlisle a four-year deal as coach|date=May 10, 2008|publisher=ESPN|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-date=October 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023024057/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3389463|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Mavs sign Carlisle\">[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jl2w-wzycOVHOI8JdZ8VAB4dLbVw AFP: Mavericks reach four-year coaching deal with Carlisle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514114056/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jl2w-wzycOVHOI8JdZ8VAB4dLbVw |date=May 14, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=MAVERICKS: Official release: Rick Carlisle named coach|url=http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Carlisle_signs051008.html|website=Mavs.com|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|date=May 9, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514120414/http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Carlisle_signs051008.html|archive-date=May 14, 2008|access-date=August 16, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====2008\u20132010: Falls in the playoffs====\n{{Main|2008\u201309 Dallas Mavericks season|2009\u201310 Dallas Mavericks season}}\nAfter getting off to 2\u20137 start, the Mavericks eventually found themselves with the sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2009]] after going 50\u201332 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season). About three to four weeks earlier, they were not even sure if they would make the eighth and final spot. But a run of 5\u20131 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. [[Dirk Nowitzki]] also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, [[2008\u201309 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nThe Mavericks surprised many people by winning Game 1, 106\u201397 in San Antonio.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=290418024 |title=Howard leads way as Mavs grab first playoff road win since '06 |publisher=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=April 19, 2009 |access-date=March 22, 2022 |archive-date=March 22, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220322164720/https://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=290418024 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Spurs quickly won game two in a rout. As the series shifted to Dallas, who had only lost one game there after the All-Star Break, won both Games 3 and 4. San Antonio was trying to win Game 5 to extend the series, but they could not do it as the Mavericks closed out the series with a 13-point-victory, 106\u201393. With the Victory, the Mavericks advanced to the Conference semi-finals for the first time since 2006.\n\nThey faced the two-seeded [[2008\u201309 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] in the semi-finals, who were fresh off a 4\u20131 series win against the [[2008\u201309 New Orleans Hornets season|New Orleans Hornets]], including a 58-point win in New Orleans. The Mavericks stayed close with the Nuggets in the first three-quarters of Games 1 and 2, but it was the fourth quarter when [[Carmelo Anthony]] and the Nuggets woke up, as they took the first two games by double-digit figures. Game 3 in Dallas was close the whole way, and Dallas led by five points with less than a minute to go. But Carmelo Anthony hit a three-pointer to give the Nuggets a 106\u2013105 victory. The play generated quite a bit of controversy because Maverick guard Antoine Wright fouled Anthony, but since there was no replay used in the NBA in 2009, the Mavericks suffered a Game 3 loss. The league later announced that the referees made the wrong call,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/news/story?id=4155285|title=NBA admits referees' error cost the Dallas Mavericks in the final seconds|date=May 10, 2009|publisher=ESPN|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-date=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213033734/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/news/story?id=4155285|url-status=live}}</ref> but despite that, the Mavericks still faced a 3\u20130 deficit in the series.\n\nNowitzki's 44 points in Game 4 saved the Mavericks season, sending the series back to Denver for a Game 5, with the series in Denver's favor, 3\u20131. Game 5 would prove to be the final game for the Mavericks of the 2009 season, as a score of 124\u2013110 would oust them. The elimination led to an off-season facing many questions about the future construction of the team.\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to the Nuggets in the playoffs, the Mavericks entered the off-season with many questions about the team's future construction. They began by re-signing [[Jason Kidd]] to a three-year contract extension, which took care of their pending point guard issue. The Mavericks also made a transaction to compound their age problem by trading for All-Star small forward [[Shawn Marion]]. In a three-team deal with the Grizzlies and Raptors, the Mavericks sent swingman Antoine Wright and defensive stalwart Devean George to Toronto, while aging guard Jerry Stackhouse landed in Memphis. Dallas also acquired athletic center [[Nathan Jawai]] and power forward [[Kris Humphries]]. Many analysts viewed this as a beneficial trade for the Mavericks, given that it countered their age issues while also providing them with more depth on the bench.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kelly |last=Dwyer |title=What grabbing Shawn Marion means to Dallas |work=Ball Don't Lie |publisher=Yahoo!

The trade sent [[Josh Howard]], [[James Singleton (basketball)|James Singleton]], and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in exchange for [[Caron Butler]], [[Brendan Haywood]], and [[Deshawn Stevenson]]. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Some NBA analysts thought that this was a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast. Many believed that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through.<ref>{{cite web |first=Marc |last=Stein |title=Butler to Mavs, Wiz get Howard |publisher=ESPN |date=February 14, 2010 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=4912262 |access-date=May 8, 2013 |archive-date=September 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915084129/http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=4912262 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Reina |title=Grading The Deal: Mavs Become Title Contenders With Butler, Haywood |website=RealGM Basketball |date=February 13, 2010 |url=http://basketball.realgm.com/article/209154/Grading-The-Deal-Mavs-Become-Title-Contenders-With-Butler-Haywood |access-date=May 8, 2013 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070257/http://basketball.realgm.com/article/209154/Grading-The-Deal-Mavs-Become-Title-Contenders-With-Butler-Haywood |url-status=live }}</ref> The trade worked because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128\u201378. This win was the third-largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] 83\u201377. The Mavericks finished the season with a 55\u201327 record, good enough for the Western Conference's second seed. The Mavericks then entered the postseason with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could earnestly contend for a title.\n\nDuring the playoffs, though, this optimism proved to be short-lived. After winning game one 100\u201394, behind Nowitzki's 36-point performance, the Mavericks dropped the next three games to their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, before winning game five. Dallas would eventually lose against San Antonio in six games 97\u201387, leading to yet another off-season full of speculation, mostly centering on franchise player Dirk Nowitzki's pending free agent status.\n\n====2010\u20132011: Championship season====\n{{see also|2011 NBA Finals}}\n[[File:Mark Cuban at the Championship parade.jpg|thumb|right|Mavericks owner [[Mark Cuban]] holding the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]] during the championship parade]]\nAfter yet another first-round exit, the Mavericks began an unexpectedly early off-season.

However, on December 27, Dirk Nowitzki sustained a knee injury that derailed the Mavericks' momentum. The team's second-leading scorer [[Caron Butler]] suffered a season-ending knee injury himself only four nights later. The Mavericks then went on to drop seven of their next nine games, causing serious concern as to who would lead the offense in Nowitzki's absence. However, this injury would prove to only be a temporary setback because Nowitzki only missed nine games and admittedly rushed back to assist the Mavericks' reeling offense. Consequently, they quickly returned to their winning ways. The Mavericks re-invented their defensive reputation around the league during the 2010\u201311 campaign, mostly in part to off-season acquisition Tyson Chandler (who was later named to the All-Defensive Second Team).<ref>{{cite web |first=Jeff |last=Caplan |title=Dirk: Chandler helps Mavs D |work=ESPN Dallas |date=December 20, 2010 |access-date=March 22, 2022 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=5939497 |archive-date=February 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217032843/http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=5939497 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Mavericks battled the San Antonio Spurs all season long for the division title, but instead settled for the third seed, with a 57\u201325 record.

However, upon their arrival at the Rose Garden in Portland, problems began to arise. After dropping game three to Portland, the Mavericks blew a 23-point fourth-quarter lead in game four to allow Portland to tie the series at two games apiece. The whispers then began to re-surface that the Mavericks would let another impressive regular season go down the drain.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Quick |title=Trail Blazers-Mavericks: Game 5 will reveal psychological impact of dramatic Portland comeback |work=Oregon Live |date=April 24, 2011 |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2011/04/trail_blazers-mavericks_game_5.html |access-date=March 22, 2022 |archive-date=June 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617115500/http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2011/04/trail_blazers-mavericks_game_5.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The Mavericks then responded, posting back-to-back wins to oust the Blazers in six games. They then met the two-time defending champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the Western Conference Semi-finals.

The Mavericks shocked the NBA world by winning the first two games in Los Angeles, heading back to Dallas. They then won a thrilling game three in Dallas, courtesy of 32 points from Nowitzki in a 98\u201392 victory.

In that game, Jason Terry set an NBA playoff record with nine three-pointers with just one miss, ousting the Lakers in a four-game sweep. The Mavericks then met the upstart [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the Western Conference finals. Dirk Nowitzki set the tone in the series in game one with a 48-point performance, with the Mavericks taking Game 1 by a score of 121\u2013112. The Thunder then responded with 106\u2013100 victory in Game 2. The Mavericks then won the next three games, including a 15-point comeback in Game 4, to take the five-game series. The Mavericks claimed their second Western Conference Championship in franchise history and met the team that defeated them in the 2006 NBA Finals, the [[Miami Heat]].\n\nThe Mavericks entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miami's [[Big Three (Miami Heat)|Big Three]] coming together at the start of the season. After dropping Game 1 in Miami by a score of 92\u201384, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of Game 2, with the Mavericks trailing 88\u201373, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0\u20132 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22\u20135 run to end the game, stunned the Heat with a game two victory, and evened the series at one game apiece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in Game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a final score of 88\u201386. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal Game 4 with Nowitzki hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch, and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112\u2013103, putting them one game from their first-ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first-ever NBA title with a 105\u201395 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \"soft\" and putting an end to the Mavericks' postseason futility.\n\n====2011\u20132013: Post-championship struggles and later absence from playoffs====\nThe 2011\u201312 season was shortened to 66 games due to a [[2011 NBA lockout|lockout]], which meant the Mavericks had to wait until [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|Christmas Day]] to raise their first championship banner. During the brief off-season, owner Mark Cuban decided to maintain financial flexibility by letting Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, J.J. Barea, and Caron Butler go. Chandler signed with the [[New York Knicks]], Stevenson joined the [[New Jersey Nets]], Barea went to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]], and Butler joined the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. Meanwhile, they acquired incumbent [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award|Sixth Man of the Year]] [[Lamar Odom]] via a trade with the Lakers, while signing veterans [[Vince Carter]] and [[Delonte West]].\n\nThe Mavericks raised their championship banner before their Finals rematch with the Heat on Christmas Day. Still, in what would soon become a mirror image of the [[2006\u201307 Miami Heat season|2006\u201307 Heat]]'s eventual failed title defense, Miami blew them out in a 105\u201394 loss, marking Dallas's first regular season loss to Miami in eight seasons. Things did not get better for Dallas after starting the season 0\u20133, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks won 14 of 18 games in January, but they posted a 22\u201322 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing seventh with a 36\u201330 record, their lowest finish since the 2007\u201308 season. Nowitzki produced 21.6 points, 6 rebounds, and 45.7% shooting, his most insufficient numbers since the 2000\u201301 season. Meanwhile, Odom, who proved to be a bad fit for the Mavericks, was deactivated for the final two months of the season.\n\nIn a rematch from the previous year, the Mavericks faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the [[2012 NBA playoffs]]. Games 1 and 2 went down to the wire, but the Mavericks fell short on both occasions as Kevin Durant made a game-winning jumper in Game 1, and late-game free throws in Game 2. Back in Dallas for Game 3, the Mavericks suffered a 95\u201379 defeat to fall behind 0\u20133. In Game 4, the Mavericks led for much of the second half, but [[James Harden]]'s 15-point fourth-quarter rallied the Thunder to a 103\u201397 win to eliminate the defending champions. It marked the first time Dallas was swept in a seven-game series. They became the third defending champion to be swept in the first round after the aforementioned 2006\u201307 Heat and the [[1956\u201357 Philadelphia Warriors season|1956\u201357 Philadelphia Warriors]].\n\nDuring the 2012 off-season, the Mavericks lost both Jason Kidd and Jason Terry to free agency. Kidd signed with the New York Knicks, while Terry joined the [[Boston Celtics]]. Brendan Haywood was later amnestied before moving to the [[Charlotte Bobcats]]. The Mavericks acquired [[Darren Collison]] from the [[Indiana Pacers]] and signed [[O. J. Mayo]] from the [[Memphis Grizzlies]]. Also joining the team were former All-Stars [[Chris Kaman]] and [[Elton Brand]].\n\nThe [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]] was a struggle for the Mavericks, as Nowitzki recovered from knee surgery and missed 29 games.

The Mavericks were 23\u201329 at the All-Star break, before making a late push for a playoff berth. Still, it did not save their season, and the Mavericks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2000.\n\n====2013\u20132016: Return to the playoffs====\n[[File:Monta ellis mavs1.JPG|left|thumb|[[Monta Ellis]] (right) and [[Chandler Parsons]] (left) each spent two seasons with the Mavericks.]]\nDuring the 2013 off-season, the Mavericks chose not to re-sign role players Collison, Brand, and Kaman. Mayo then declined to exercise his player option and later signed with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. The Mavericks signed [[Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (basketball)|Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n]] from the [[Detroit Pistons]] and [[Monta Ellis]] from the Bucks. They also signed veteran [[Samuel Dalembert]].\n\nOn April 4, 2014, the Mavericks swept the season series with the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time since the 1980\u201381 season with a 107\u201395 win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400490015|title=Dirk Nowitzki's 27 help Mavs beat 2nd L.A. team in as many nights|publisher=ESPN|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-date=June 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626151409/http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400490015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Mavericks finished 49\u201333, one game ahead of Phoenix for the eighth and final playoff spot, which meant that they would once again have to face their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, the top seed in the Western Conference with a 62\u201320 record. In Game 1 in San Antonio, Dallas had an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1, 85\u201390. However, the Mavs forced 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 seconds left, but a buzzer-beater by [[Vince Carter]] gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 despite a late Dallas comeback, after the Spurs at one point had a 20-point lead and later won Game 5 at home, 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 series lead. The Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111\u2013113. Game 7 was on the Spurs home court, and the Spurs beat the Mavericks 119\u201396, putting an end to the Mavericks' season.\n\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Mavericks made several moves, the first of which was trading for Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton from the New York Knicks, sending Calder\u00f3n, Dalembert, Shane Larkin, and Wayne Ellington as well as two-second-round draft picks, on June 26, 2014, right before the draft. Nowitzki also took a generous discount, re-signing for three years and $25&nbsp;million, which helped Dallas sign restricted free agent [[Chandler Parsons]] from the Houston Rockets to a three-year contract at $46&nbsp;million. Devin Harris was re-signed for four years and $16&nbsp;million. Dallas brought in [[Richard Jefferson]], [[Al-Farouq Aminu]], [[Jameer Nelson]], [[Greg Smith (basketball, born 1991)|Greg Smith]] to build a deep bench. The Mavs' sixth man, Vince Carter, left in free agency to the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nOn November 13, 2014, the Mavericks recorded their largest victory ever with a 123\u201370 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.

The Mavericks were the seventh seed in the playoffs and finished the season 50\u201332.\n\nOn April 25, 2016, the Mavericks were once again knocked out of the first round, this time, by the Oklahoma City Thunder in a 4\u20131 series loss. After managing to win a game at OKC and tying the series 1\u20131, the Mavericks lost three straight to lose the series. This series was marked by both teams' physicality, including a Kevin Durant Flagrant 2 foul and several Mavericks playing very aggressive defense on Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.\n\n====2016\u20132019: Lottery return, the arrival of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Dirk's final years====\nThe Mavericks did not make the playoffs during the 2016\u201317 season, despite efforts from their newest additions, [[Seth Curry]], [[Harrison Barnes]], [[Nerlens Noel]], and [[Yogi Ferrell]]. They began the season going 3\u201315 through their first 18 games, and could not bounce back, finishing at a 33\u201349 record despite fighting towards a winning record, even reaching a 28\u201336 record partway through the season. This season was the second time in 17 years they missed the playoffs, with the other being the 2012\u20132013 season. The season marked the first time the team finished with a losing record since the 1999\u20132000 season.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks received the ninth pick in the [[2017 NBA draft]] and used it to select point guard [[Dennis Smith Jr.]] out of [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]].

The uniform was selected among thousands of entries as part of a design-a-uniform contest the Mavericks initiated during the 2013\u201314 season, but was not worn until the 2015\u201316 season.\n\nWith the switch to Nike as the uniform supplier in 2017, the home and away uniform designations were eliminated. In its place are the \"Icon\" uniforms, \"Association\" uniforms, \"Statement\" uniforms and \"City\" uniforms. The Mavericks' white uniforms are part of the \"Association\" set, the royal blue uniforms are identified with the \"Icon\" set, and the navy blue uniforms are included in the \"Statement\" set.\n\nFor the \"City\" set, the Mavericks wore black uniforms with \"DAL\" and the numbers in royal blue with neon green trim (a nod to the original Mavericks' colors). This set was worn only during the 2017\u201318 season, after which a new \"City\" uniform would be designed. The new \"City\" uniform was unveiled in November 2018. The \"DAL\" across the chest was replaced with the team's secondary logo and the neon green trim was removed, with the numbers no longer having a trim color. The \"City\" uniform for the 2019\u201320 season featured a stylized \"MAVS\" wordmark inspired from [[graffiti]] paintings. The uniform base had a light blue/navy blue gradient and neon green trim. The \"City\" uniform for 2020\u201321 featured a white base with gold and silver trim, which was said to be inspired by [[Pegasus]], a Dallas symbol.\n\nPrior to the 2019\u201320 season, the Mavericks drastically redesigned their navy \"Statement\" uniforms, eliminating the Dallas skyline and reverting to the full team name \"Mavericks\" in front. The uniform contains white lettering and white and royal blue side stripes.\n\nDuring the 2021\u201322 season, in commemoration of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the Mavericks wore \"City\" uniforms featuring various elements taken from past uniforms. The template used is from their current uniforms, but with green striping. The typography resembled the Mavericks' uniforms from 1980 to 2001, and featured a modified version of the cowboy hat logo (except the \"M\" was replaced with a \"D\"). A recolored version of the current horse logo appears on the shorts, and the skyline silhouette from their 2015\u20132019 navy alternates is placed on the beltline.\n\nThe 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform featured retro-style white letters with green trim on a blue base, which was a nod to the late 1970s\u2013early 1980s [[disco]] era that served as a boom period within the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Dallas Mavericks 22/23 City Edition Uniform: The Metroplex |url=https://www.nba.com/news/dallas-mavericks-city-edition |publisher=National Basketball Association |access-date=November 11, 2022 |date=November 10, 2022 |archive-date=November 10, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221110183332/https://www.nba.com/news/dallas-mavericks-city-edition |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nFor the 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform, the Mavericks partnered with [[Grammy Award]]-winning recording artist [[Leon Bridges]] in designing the uniform.

Currently, the head coach is [[Jason Kidd]], who in 2022 led the Mavericks to the team's first playoff series win since the 2011 championship season that he won as a player.\n\n==Rivalries==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Miami Heat===\nThe Mavericks-Heat rivalry is a testament to when the two teams faced each other in the NBA finals on two occasions. First they came head to head in the [[2006 NBA Finals]], in which the two teams captured their first respective conference titles. The Mavericks came into the series 60\u201322 with a strong group of players while the Miami Heat came in with a respectable 52\u201330 record and sported an aging but still strong [[Shaquille O'Neal]] as well as an up-and-coming [[Dwyane Wade]]. Dallas was favored by many in the media to win the series. The Dallas Mavericks won the first two games but Miami went on to sweep the next four and win the NBA championship for the first time in team history.\n\nBoth teams saw success over the next few seasons and appeared in the playoffs multiple times, and would ultimately go on to have a rematch in the [[2011 NBA Finals]]. It was also the first time that either team had reached the Finals since 2006. This time, however, Miami was favored to win after the highly publicized signings of [[LeBron James]] and [[Chris Bosh]] to their roster. Dallas came in with a 57\u201325 record while the Heat came in 58\u201324. Miami won the first game 92\u201384, but Dallas went on to win four of the next five and upset the Heat to win the first title in franchise history.\n\n===San Antonio Spurs===\n{{main|Mavericks\u2013Spurs rivalry}}\nThe Mavericks-Spurs rivalry is relatively new but very fierce. It features two teams with Dallas roots\u2014the Spurs began their life in the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavericks made their NBA debut by defeating the Spurs 103\u201392. The teams have met numerous times in the playoffs, with the Spurs defeating the Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014, while the Mavericks defeated the Spurs in 2006 and 2009. The Spurs have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and three conference titles. The Spurs have won 15 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 5. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks have 3 60-win seasons. This is known as the \"I-35 rivalry\" because both cities lie on [[Interstate 35]].\n\nThe two teams met in the playoffs during the 2000\u20132001 season with the Spurs winning in five games. Little was made during this series, as the Spurs won their first NBA championship only two years before. The Mavericks, run by a trio of [[Steve Nash]], [[Michael Finley]], and [[Dirk Nowitzki]], had just defeated the [[Utah Jazz]] despite not having home-court advantage and were only starting to meld into a title contender.\n\nThe two teams met again in 2003 in the Western Conference finals. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks had 60-win seasons and reached the Western Conference finals after defeating the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Sacramento Kings]], respectively. Despite having the best season of their history, the Mavericks fell in six games to the Spurs.\n\nThe rivalry took on a new meaning in 2005 when, near the end of the regular season, [[Don Nelson]] would resign as head coach of the Mavericks, apparently satisfied with the state of the team, and hand the coaching reins to former Spur [[Avery Johnson]], the [[point guard]] of the 1999 NBA champion Spurs team who hit the game-winning shot against the [[New York Knicks]]. Since Johnson was coached under Spurs' head coach [[Gregg Popovich]], he would be familiar with most, if not all, of Popovich's coaching style and philosophy. During the 2005 off-season, [[Michael Finley]], waived by the Mavericks under the amnesty clause, joined the Spurs in search for the elusive title.\n\nDuring the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won the first game at home 87\u201385. The Mavericks got revenge the next game, winning 113\u201391 and evening the series up at 1\u20131. The Mavericks then won a dramatic Game 3 by a single point, 104\u2013103. Though Manu Gin\u00f3bili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly contested Game 4 123\u2013118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]], who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that, winning 119\u2013111. The Mavericks went on to the Conference Finals where they defeated the Suns in six games, but succumbed to the champion Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\nDespite much anticipation of a renewed meeting in the 2007 Western Conference finals, the Mavericks lost to the Golden State Warriors in one of the greatest upsets in NBA history. The Spurs won the NBA finals after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20130.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10005744 |title=Dallas Mavericks Upset by Oakland Upstarts |publisher=NPR |date=May 4, 2007 |access-date=June 16, 2011 |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119035516/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10005744 |url-status=live }}</ref> The eighth seed Warriors, who made the playoffs on the last game of the NBA season, defeated the 67-win, first-seed Mavericks in six games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270503009 |title=ESPN&nbsp;\u2013 Dallas vs. Golden State Recap, May 3, 2007 |publisher=ESPN |date=May 3, 2007 |access-date=June 16, 2011 |archive-date=May 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519095437/http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270503009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Meanwhile, the Spurs would ultimately go on to win the 2007 NBA Championship, establishing themselves as a true NBA dynasty.<ref>[https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=3281217&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 Sweep!

[[Joey Crawford]], the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight which led to the longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading into the locker room, [[American Airlines Center]] erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game saw chippy play, with [[Jerry Stackhouse]] and [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] getting into an altercation after a rebound.\n\nIn the 2009 NBA playoffs, the Mavericks and Spurs squared off again in the first round. The Spurs and Mavericks split the first two games in San Antonio, but Dallas defeated the Spurs in games 3 and 4, both in Dallas. The Mavericks then went on to close out the series and eliminated the Spurs at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.\n\nIn 2010, the Dallas Mavericks matched up against the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs. Although the Mavericks managed to obtain the number two seed, they were defeated by the Spurs in six games.\n\nDuring the 2011 playoffs, a role reversal of sorts occurred between the two rivals, when the top-seeded Spurs were defeated by the eighth-seeded [[Memphis Grizzlies]], the first time an eight-seed defeated a one-seed since the Mavericks-Warriors series of 2007. In addition, the Mavericks defeated the LeBron James-led [[Miami Heat]] in the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Mavericks were swept in the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]] by the Spurs for the first time since the [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]], Tim Duncan's rookie season. In their last match-up of the season, San Antonio escaped with a 92\u201391 victory over Dallas when a [[Vince Carter]] 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. With the win, the Spurs clinched a playoff spot for the 16th straight season, currently the longest streak in the NBA. San Antonio also reached 50 wins for the 14th straight season, the longest streak in NBA history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278687|title=Spurs edge Mavericks to sweep season series|publisher=ESPN|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305112253/http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278687|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], the Spurs once again swept the Mavericks in the regular season, giving them nine straight victories. In addition, an overtime loss to the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] on April 16, 2014, ensured that the Mavericks would face the Spurs once again in the [[2014 NBA playoffs]], where the Mavericks were the eighth seed and San Antonio the first. In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas reached an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 90\u201385. However, the Mavericks managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer-beater by [[Vince Carter]] gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 and later Game 5 at home 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 lead. The Mavericks won Game 6 at home by 113\u2013111. The Spurs won game 7 119\u201396, eliminating the Mavericks in the first round.\n\n===Phoenix Suns===\nDuring the 2004 off-season, former Dallas Mavericks point guard [[Steve Nash]] signed a free-agent deal with the 29\u201353 [[Phoenix Suns]] to help out their offense. The addition of Nash helped as Phoenix rolled to a 62\u201320 record and the best record in the NBA. The teams met in the [[2005 NBA playoffs#(1) Phoenix Suns vs. (4) Dallas Mavericks|2005 Western Conference Semifinals]] with Phoenix having the home-court advantage.\n\nPhoenix won game 1 127\u2013102 with a 40-point game by [[Amar'e Stoudemire]]. Steve Nash was also given his [[NBA MVP]] award during that game, a game in which he terrorized his former team. However, Mavericks star [[Dirk Nowitzki]] hit a game-winning turn-around jumper in game 2 to beat Phoenix 108\u2013106 to send the series back to Dallas tied 1\u20131. Phoenix and Dallas split the two games in [[Dallas]] which saw both winners of games score 119 points. The series went back to Phoenix then took care of Dallas 114\u2013108 in the [[America West Arena]] (now US Airways Center). Then, in game 6, with Dallas facing elimination, Phoenix beat Dallas in a thriller which saw [[Steve Nash]] with a 39-point game, to go along with 12 assists. In the [[2005 NBA playoffs#(1) Phoenix Suns vs. (2) San Antonio Spurs|Western Conference finals]], Phoenix lost to the [[San Antonio Spurs]], who then went on to win the [[2005 NBA Finals|NBA title]].\n\nThe following year, a Suns team without Stoudemire (who was injured), [[Joe Johnson (basketball)|Joe Johnson]], and [[Quentin Richardson]], but with a core of new players led by [[Raja Bell]] (who clotheslined Lakers star [[Kobe Bryant]] in a first-round series game), [[Boris Diaw]] and [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] to go along with Nash and fellow All-Star [[Shawn Marion]]. Phoenix had to play seven-game series against the two Los Angeles teams, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (who had a 3\u20131 lead against Phoenix) and the resurgent [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. In the [[2006 NBA playoffs#(2) Phoenix Suns vs. (4) Dallas Mavericks|Western Conference finals]], they faced a Mavericks team who won 60 games, but were forced to be the fourth seed since the division winners got the top three seeds. On their way to the Western Conference finals, Dallas swept the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], and beat in-state rival [[San Antonio Spurs]] in seven tense games. Phoenix won game 1 121\u2013118 after Diaw hit a game-winning shot in the dying seconds of the fourth quarter. Bell, though injured himself in game 1, missing Games Two and Three. After that, Dallas took control of the series, winning Games Two and Three by the scores of 105\u201398 and 95\u201388. Bell came back for game 4 and led Phoenix to a 106\u201386 win. Dallas however, beat Phoenix 117\u2013101 in game 5 which included a 50-point performance from Dirk Nowitzki, and eliminated the Suns in Phoenix 102\u201393 in game 6. Dallas would later lose to the [[Miami Heat]] in [[2006 NBA Finals|six games]], despite winning the first two games.\n\nOn March 14, 2007, in Dallas, Phoenix beat Dallas in a 129\u2013127 double-overtime thriller. With the Mavericks up by 7 with a minute left in regulation, Dirk Nowitzki (a 90% free throw shooter) missed two free throws. Steve Nash fed off his mistakes and scored 10 straight points including the game-tying three-pointer with 3 seconds left to go.

In the [[1984 NBA playoffs]], the Lakers won over the Mavericks in the Western Conference Semi-finals with the series 4\u20131. In 1986, they met again in the semi-finals and the Lakers won the series 4\u20132. In the [[1988 NBA playoffs]], the Lakers, who were the defending champions, defeated the Mavericks in a seven-game series in the Western Conference finals and eventually became the back-to-back champions after winning the [[1988 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. In 2011, the Mavericks met the two-time defending champions Lakers in the semi-finals and rejected their three-peat by sweeping them in four games and eventually won the [[2011 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. In Game 2 of the [[2011 NBA playoffs]], [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]] was ejected for hitting [[J. J. Barea]] and suspended for Game 3. In Game 4, [[Lamar Odom]] was ejected for pushing [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and then [[Andrew Bynum]] was ejected for elbowing [[J. J. Barea]]. Both players received flagrant foul 2. After the [[2011 NBA lockout]], Lamar Odom was sent to the Mavericks after he requested to leave the Lakers due to the vetoed Chris Paul trade.
