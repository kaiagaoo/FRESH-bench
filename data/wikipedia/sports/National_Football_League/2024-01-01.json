of the season was declared the champion; the only tiebreaker was that in the event of a tie if two teams played twice in a season, the result of the second game determined the title (the source of the 1921 controversy). This method had been used since the league's creation in 1920, but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first. The league quickly determined that a [[1932 NFL Playoff Game|playoff game]] between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league's champion. The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game, officially a regular-season game that would count towards the regular season standings, at [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago, but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to [[Chicago Stadium]], which did not have a regulation-size football field. Playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field, the Bears won the game 9\u20130 and thus won the championship. Fan interest in the ''de facto'' championship game led the NFL, beginning in [[1933 NFL season|1933]], to split into [[Eastern and Western Conferences (NFL) 1933\u201369|two divisions]] with a championship game to be played between the division champions.<ref name=\"The 60-Yard Circus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/1932%20Season.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929180027/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/1932%20Season.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 29, 2010|title=The 60-Yard Circus|last=Carroll|first=Bob|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|access-date=February 9, 2013}}</ref> The [[1934 NFL season|1934 season]] also marked the first of twelve seasons in which African Americans were [[Black players in professional American football|absent from the league]].

Rival leagues included at least three separate [[American Football League (disambiguation)|American Football Leagues]] and the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), on top of various regional leagues of varying caliber. Three NFL teams trace their histories to these rival leagues; the [[Los Angeles Rams]] who came from a 1936 iteration of the American Football League, and the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]], both from the AAFC. By the 1950s, the NFL had an effective monopoly on professional football in the United States; its only competition in North America was the professional [[Canadian football]] circuit, which formally became the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) in 1958. With Canadian football being [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|a different football code]] than the American game, the CFL established a niche market in Canada and still survives as an independent league.\n\nA new professional league, the fourth [[American Football League]] (AFL), began to play in 1960. The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] on June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the [[Super Bowl]], was held four times before the merger, with the NFL winning [[Super Bowl I]] and [[Super Bowl II]], and the AFL winning [[Super Bowl III]] and [[Super Bowl IV]].<ref name=\"Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger\">{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010215044251/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 15, 2001 |title=Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger |last=Cross |first=B.

The league mandated a twelve-game regular season for each team beginning in [[1935 NFL season|1935]], later shortening this to eleven games in [[1937 NFL season|1937]] and ten games in [[1943 NFL season|1943]], mainly due to World War II. After the war ended, the number of games returned to eleven games in [[1946 NFL season|1946]], and later back to twelve in 1947. The NFL went to a 14-game schedule in [[1961 NFL season|1961]], which it retained until switching to a 16-game schedule in [[1978 NFL season|1978]].<ref name=\"NFL Regular Season Games Played per Season\">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1348|title=NFL Regular Season Games Played per Season|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|access-date=February 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512202615/http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1348|archive-date=May 12, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In March 2021, the NFL officially adopted a 17-game schedule after gaining the agreement of the [[National Football League Players Association]] (NFLPA).<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-season-to-feature-17-regular-season-games-per-team| title=NFL season to feature 17 regular-season games per team| publisher=NFL Enterprises| website=nfl.com| date=March 30, 2021| access-date=June 28, 2021}}</ref>\n\nHaving an odd number of games in the schedule will give half the teams nine games as the home team, while half the teams have only eight home games. To minimize the perceived benefit on competition of having more home games, the extra home game will be rotated between the two conferences each year. This is because playoff berths are allocated at the conference level, so all teams within the conference will have played the same number of home games.\n\nThe NFL operated in a two-conference system from 1933 to [[1966 NFL season|1966]], where the champions of each conference would meet in the [[History of the National Football League championship#1933\u20131966: NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]]. If two teams tied for the conference lead, they would meet in a [[one-game playoff]] to determine the conference champion. In [[1967 NFL season|1967]], the NFL expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams. Instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion [[New Orleans Saints]] to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned the conferences and split each into two four-team divisions. The four division champions would meet in the [[NFL playoffs]], a two-round playoff.<ref name=\"Lady Luck and the Lombardi legend\">{{cite web|url=http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/content/lady-luck-and-the-lombardi-legend/4897/|title=Lady Luck and the Lombardi legend|date=October 12, 2005|publisher=Cold Hard Football Facts.

Effectively, a [[third place playoff|third-place game]], pitting the two conference runners-up against each other, the league considers Playoff Bowls to have been [[exhibition game|exhibitions]] rather than playoff games. The league discontinued the Playoff Bowl in 1970 due to its perception as a game for losers.<ref name=\"This Day in Browns History \u2013 Jan. 7\">{{cite web|last=King|first=Steve|title=This Day in Browns History \u2013 Jan. 7|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-1/This-Day-in-Browns-History---Jan-7/2c6ca22c-ca60-442a-93bd-09cbe18976f7|publisher=Cleveland Browns|website=ClevelandBrowns.com|date=January 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111082936/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/article-1/This-Day-in-Browns-History---Jan-7/2c6ca22c-ca60-442a-93bd-09cbe18976f7|archive-date=January 11, 2013|access-date=December 31, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the addition of the former AFL teams into the NFL in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], the NFL split into two conferences with three divisions each.

When the NFL expanded to 32 teams in [[2002 NFL season|2002]], the league realigned, changing the division structure from three divisions in each conference to four divisions in each conference.
