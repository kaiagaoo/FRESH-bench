During most of their 75 seasons in New York City, the Giants played home games at various incarnations of the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[Upper Manhattan]].\n\nNumerous inductees of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] played for the New York Giants, including [[John McGraw]], [[Christy Mathewson]], [[Mel Ott]], [[Bill Terry]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Monte Irvin]], and [[Travis Jackson]]. During the club's tenure in New York, they produced five of the franchise's eight World Series wins ([[1905 World Series|1905]], [[1921 World Series|1921]], [[1922 World Series|1922]], [[1933 World Series|1933]], [[1954 World Series|1954]]) and 17 of its 23 National League pennants. Famous moments in the Giants' New York history include the 1922 World Series, in which the Giants swept the Yankees in four games, the 1951 home run by New York Giants outfielder and third baseman [[Bobby Thomson]] known as the [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\"]], and the defensive feat by Mays during Game 1 of the 1954 World Series known as [[The Catch (baseball)|\"the Catch\"]].\n\nThe Giants had intense rivalries with their fellow New York teams, the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].  The Giants faced the Yankees in six World Series and played the league rival Dodgers multiple times per season. Games between any two of these three teams were known collectively as the [[Subway Series]]. The Dodgers-Giants rivalry continues, as both teams moved to [[California]] after the 1957 season, with the Dodgers relocating to Los Angeles. The [[New York Giants]] of the National Football League (NFL) are named after the team.\n\n=== San Francisco Giants ===\n{{main|History of the San Francisco Giants}}\n[[File:San Francisco Giants Fans Celebrating World Series Win 2014.jpg|thumb|Fans celebrating the Giants' [[2014 World Series]] victory at San Francisco City Hall.]]\nThe Giants, along with their rival [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], became the first Major League Baseball teams to play on the West Coast. On April 15, 1958, the Giants played their first game in San Francisco, defeating the former Brooklyn and now Los Angeles Dodgers, 8\u20130.  The Giants played for two seasons at [[Seals Stadium]] (from 1931 to 1957, the stadium was the home of the [[Pacific Coast League|PCL]]'s [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]]) before moving to [[Candlestick Park]] in [[1960 San Francisco Giants season|1960]].  The Giants played at Candlestick Park until [[1999 San Francisco Giants season|1999]], before opening [[Oracle Park|Pacific Bell Park]] (now known as Oracle Park) in [[2000 San Francisco Giants season|2000]], where the Giants currently play.\n\nThe Giants struggled to sustain consistent success in their first 50 years in San Francisco.  They made nine playoff appearances and won three NL pennants between 1958 and 2009.  The Giants lost the [[1962 World Series]] in seven games to the New York Yankees. The Giants were swept in the [[1989 World Series]] by their cross-Bay rival [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]], a series best known for the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], which caused a 10-day delay between Games 2 and 3.  The Giants also lost the [[2002 World Series]] to the [[Los Angeles Angels|Anaheim Angels]].  One of the team's biggest highlights during this time was the [[2001 San Francisco Giants season|2001]] season, in which outfielder [[Barry Bonds]] hit 73 [[home run]]s, breaking the record for most home runs in a season. In 2007, Bonds would surpass [[Hank Aaron]]'s career record of 755 home runs.  Bonds finished his career with 762 home runs (586 hit with the Giants), which is still the MLB record.\n\nThe Giants won three World Series championships in [[2010 World Series|2010]], [[2012 World Series|2012]], and [[2014 World Series|2014]], giving the team eight total World Series titles, including the five won as the New York Giants.\n\nPlayers inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] as members of the San Francisco Giants include CF [[Willie Mays]], 1B [[Orlando Cepeda]], P [[Juan Marichal]], 1B [[Willie McCovey]], and P [[Gaylord Perry]].\n\n==Uniforms==\n===1958\u20131972===\nUpon moving to San Francisco, the Giants kept the same uniform they wore in New York, save for two changes. The cap logo now had an interlocking \"SF\" in orange, while the road uniform now featured \"San Francisco\" in black block letters with orange trim. Neckline, pants and sleeves feature thin black and orange stripes.\n\n===1973\u20131976===\nChanging to double-knit polyester, the Giants made a few noticeable changes to their uniform. The color scheme on the letters was changed to orange with black trim, and player names were added on the back. The cap logo remained the same.\n\n===1977\u20131982===\nFor the 1977 season, the Giants switched to pullover uniforms. \"Giants\" on the home uniform was changed from serifed block lettering to cursive script, and the color scheme returned to black with orange trim. The road uniform became orange, with letters in black with white trim. Neck and sleeve stripes are in black, orange and white. Both uniforms received chest numbers. The standard cap was changed to feature an orange brim.\n\nThe 1978 season saw the Giants add a black alternate uniform, an inverse of their road orange uniform. All three uniforms now featured the \"Giants\" script previously exclusive to the home uniform.\n\n===1983\u20131993===\nBefore the 1983 season, the Giants returned to a traditional buttoned uniform designed by [[Nicolas Sidjakov|Sidjakov Berman & Gomez]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/30/sports/scouting-high-fashion.html Durso, Joseph. \"Scouting: High Fashion,\" ''The New York Times'', Wednesday, January 30, 1985.] Retrieved October 25, 2023.</ref> This design returned to the classic look they wore early in their San Francisco tenure, but with a few exceptions. The lettering became more rounded (save for the player's name), the neck stripes were removed, and the interlocking \"SF\" and black piping was added on the road gray uniform. The caps returned to an all-black design.\n\n===1994\u20131999===\nIn 1994, the Giants made a few changes to their uniform. The road uniform reverted to \"San Francisco\" in front and removed the piping. The front of both uniforms returned to stylized block letters with pointed edges, but kept the rounded numbers. The \"SF\" on the cap was also changed to reflect the lettering change.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nCoinciding with the move to [[Oracle Park]] (then Pacific Bell Park) in 2000, the Giants unveiled new uniforms which were aesthetically close to the style they originally wore in their early years. On each uniform, numbers returned to a block letter style.\n\n====Home====\nThe base of the home uniform was changed to cream. The \"Giants\" wordmark kept the same stylized block letter treatment but the arrangement was changed from a vertical to a radial arch. Neck stripes also returned with this uniform. Gold drop shadows were also added. A sleeve patch containing the team logo and the words \"San Francisco Baseball Club\" was also featured.\n\n====Road====\nThe gray road uniform returned to the classic \"San Francisco\" wordmark used in the 1960s, though in 2005 gold drop shadows were also added. This uniform was then tweaked to include black piping in 2012. Two sleeve patches were used. Between 2000 and 2010, the patch featured \"SF\" in orange letters in front of a baseball, with the full name added within a black circle. In 2011, this was changed to the sleeve patch used on the home uniform. Until 2020, only the road uniform featured player names; since 2021, all Giants uniforms have player names on the back.\n\n====Black alternate====\nIn 2001, the Giants added a road and home alternate black uniform. Each uniform shared the same design as their home and road counterparts, with the exception of the road alternate receiving gold drop shadows. The home design was dropped after only one season, and the road version was retired the following year. Both sets were worn with an all-black cap but with the squatchee in black (the primary cap has an orange squatchee) and the \"SF\" wordmark changed to black with orange trim.\n\nIn 2015, the Giants unveiled a new black alternate uniform to be used on select Saturday home games. This set has the interlocking \"SF\" in front along with orange piping and a new sleeve patch containing the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] atop the \"Giants\" wordmark. Initially, the letters were in black with orange trim, but this was changed to orange with black trim and orange drop shadows.\n\n====Orange alternate====\nBefore the 2010 season, the Giants unveiled a new orange alternate uniform to be used on Friday home games. Initially, this design was similar to the home uniform save for a trim change to cream, but in 2011, the sleeve patch was changed to the one previously used on the team's road uniform. In 2014, the orange alternate were tweaked slightly, adding black piping and a new sleeve patch featuring the interlocking \"SF\" logo, and returning to the script \"Giants\" lettering previously used in the late 1970s. This design is usually paired with a black cap with orange brim featuring the \"SF\" logo.\n\n====Road alternate====\nBetween 2012 and 2019, the Giants wore a second gray road uniform. This design was similar to the primary roads, but with the \"SF\" in place of the city name (a nod to the 1983\u20131993 road uniforms).\n\n====City Connect====\nIn 2021, Major League Baseball and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] introduced the \"City Connect\" program, with teams wearing special uniforms that reflect the pride and personality of their community. The Giants' version is a white base with orange accents, featuring the stylized \"G\" in an orange/white gradient. The gradient represents the [[San Francisco fog]] that envelopes the Bay Area many months per year. An orange silhouette of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] is printed on the sleeves. The uniform is paired with an all-orange cap with the \"SF\" in orange with white trim. The uniforms are usually worn on Tuesday home games.\n\n==Rivalries==\nThe Giants' rivalry with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] dates back to when the two teams were based in New York, as does their rivalry with the [[New York Yankees]]. The Dodger and Giants rivalry is one of the longest rivalries in sports history. Their rivalry with the [[Oakland Athletics]] dates back to when the Giants were in New York and the A's were in Philadelphia and played each other in the 1905, 1911, & 1913 World Series, and was renewed in 1968 when the Athletics moved from Kansas City and the teams again played each other in the earthquake-interrupted 1989 Bay Bridge World Series. The 2010 [[NLCS]] inaugurated a Giants rivalry with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] after confrontations between [[Jonathan S\u00e1nchez]] and [[Chase Utley]], and between [[Ram\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez (Dominican pitcher)|Ram\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez]] and [[Shane Victorino]]. However, with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] dropping off as one of the premier teams of the National League, this rivalry has died down since 2010 and 2011. Another rivalry that has intensified recently is with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], whom the team has faced 4 times in the [[NLCS]].\n\nThe rivalry between the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] and [[Chicago Cubs]] in the early 20th century was once regarded as one of the most heated in baseball,<ref>''A Cunning Kind of Play: The Cubs\u2013Giants Rivalry, 1876\u20131932'' by Warren N. Wilbert</ref> with [[Merkle's Boner]] leading to a 1908 season-ending matchup in New York of particular note. That historical rivalry was revisited when the Giants beat the Cubs in the 1989 NL playoffs, in their tiebreaker game in Chicago at the end of the 1998 season, and on June 6, 2012, in a \"Turn Back The Century\" game in which both teams wore replica 1912 uniforms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120602&content_id=32658208&notebook_id=32660732&vkey=notebook_sf&c_id=sf |title=Giants, Cubs commemorate 1912 &#124; SFGiants.com: News |publisher=Sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com |access-date=October 31, 2012 |archive-date=June 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606014522/http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120602&content_id=32658208&notebook_id=32660732&vkey=notebook_sf&c_id=sf |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Los Angeles Dodgers===\n{{Main|Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry}}\nThe '''Giants-Dodgers rivalry''' is one of the longest-standing rivalries in team sports.<ref name=\"forbes.com\"/>\n\nThe Giants-Dodgers feud began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City, with the Dodgers based in [[Brooklyn]] and the Giants playing at the [[Polo Grounds]] in upper [[Manhattan]]. After the 1957 season, Dodgers owner [[Walter O'Malley]] decided to move the team to Los Angeles primarily for financial reasons.<ref name=MoveToCalifornia>{{cite book|title=After many a summer: the passing of the Giants and Dodgers and a golden age in New York baseball|first=Robert|last=Murphy|year=2009|location=New York|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-1-4027-6068-6|url=https://archive.org/details/aftermanysummerp0000murp}}</ref> Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner [[Horace Stoneham]] (who was considering moving his team to [[Minnesota]]) to preserve the rivalry by taking his team to San Francisco as well.<ref name=MoveToCalifornia/> New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move.<ref name=MoveToCalifornia/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Dodgers move west: the transfer of the Brooklyn baseball franchise to Los Angeles|first=Neil J.|last=Sullivan|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1987|isbn=0-19-504366-9|url=https://archive.org/details/dodgersmovewest00sull}}</ref> Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been competitors in economic, cultural and political arenas, their new California venues became fertile ground for transplantation of the ancient rivalry. In the wake of the Giants' and Dodgers' leaving New York, a new ballclub was born in 1962 in Queens: The New York Mets. The team's colors (blue and orange) were an homage to the recently departed teams.\n\nBoth teams' having endured for over a century while leaping across an entire continent, as well as the rivalry's growth from cross-city to cross-state, have led to its being considered one of the greatest in sports history.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 10 greatest rivalries|url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/bestrivalries.html|date=January 3, 2000|work=ESPN|access-date=December 2, 2010|archive-date=October 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025044126/http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/bestrivalries.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Caple|first=Jim|title=Giants-Dodgers best rivalry in baseball|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/caple_jim/1432476.html|date=September 16, 2002|work=ESPN|access-date=December 2, 2010|archive-date=May 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530112719/http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/caple_jim/1432476.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Beard |first=Donald |title=Giants-Dodgers Covers a Lot of Ground |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A8285-2005Mar28?language=printer |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628232226/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A8285-2005Mar28?language=printer |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2011 |date=March 30, 2005 |newspaper=The Washington Post |page=H05}}</ref>\n\nThe Giants-Dodgers rivalry has seen both teams enjoy periods of success at the expense of the other. While the Giants have more total wins, head-to-head wins, and [[World Series]] titles in their franchise histories, the Dodgers have won the [[National League West]] 11 more times than the Giants since the start of division play in 1969. Both teams have made the postseason as a [[Major League Baseball wild card|National League wild card]] twice. The Giants won their first world championship in California in 2010, while the Dodgers won their last world title in 2020. As of the end of the 2020 baseball season, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] lead the San Francisco Giants in California [[World Series]] triumphs, 6\u20133, whereas in 20th-century New York, the Giants led the Dodgers in World Series championships, 5\u20131. The combined franchise histories give the Giants an 8\u20137 edge in MLB championships, overall.\n\n===Oakland Athletics===\n{{main|Bay Bridge Series}}\nA geographic rivalry with the cross-Bay [[American League]] Athletics greatly increased with the [[1989 World Series]], nicknamed the \"Battle of the Bay\", which Oakland swept (and which was interrupted by the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] moments before the scheduled start of Game 3 in San Francisco). This dates back to when the Giants and Athletics were rivals, when the Giants were in New York and the Athletics in Philadelphia. They met in the 1905, 1911, and 1913 World Series. In addition, the introduction of [[interleague play]] in 1997 has pitted the two teams against each other for usually six games every season since 1997, three in each city (but only four in 2013, two in each city). Before 1997, they played each other only in [[Cactus League]] [[spring training]]. Their [[interleague play]] wins and losses (63\u201357 in favor of the A's) have been fairly evenly divided despite differences in league, style of play, stadium, payroll, fan base stereotypes, media coverage and World Series records, all of which have heightened the rivalry in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/games/head2head.cgi?teams=OAK&from=1997&to=2014&submit=Submit|title=Head-to-head record for Oakland Athletics against the listed opponents from 1997 to 2014|access-date=March 27, 2018|archive-date=September 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924181613/http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/head2head.cgi?teams=OAK&from=1997&to=2014&submit=Submit|url-status=live}}</ref> The intensity of the rivalry and how it is understood varies among Bay Area fans. A's fans generally view the Giants as a hated rival, while Giants fans generally view the A's as a friendly rival much lower on the scale. This is most likely due to the A's lack of a historical rival, while the Giants have their heated rivalry with the Dodgers. Some Bay Area fans are fans of both teams. The \"split hats\" that feature the logos of both teams best embodies the shared fan base. Other Bay Area fans view the competition between the two teams as a \"friendly rivalry\", with little actual hatred compared to similar ones such as the Subway Series ([[Mets\u2013Yankees rivalry|New York Mets vs. New York Yankees]]), the Red Line Series ([[White Sox \u2013 Cubs rivalry|Chicago Cubs vs. Chicago White Sox]]) and the [[Freeway Series]] (Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Los Angeles Angels).\n\nThe Giants and A's enjoyed a limited rivalry at the start of the 20th century before the Yankees began to dominate after the acquisition of [[Babe Ruth]] in 1920, when the Giants were in New York and the A's were in Philadelphia. The teams were managed by legendary leaders [[John McGraw]] and [[Connie Mack]], who were considered not only friendly rivals but the premier managers during that era, especially in view of their longevity (Mack for 50 years, McGraw for 30) since both were majority owners. Each team played in five of the first 15 World Series (tying them with the Red Sox and Cubs for most World Series appearances during that time period). As the New York Giants and the Philadelphia A's, they met in three World Series, with the Giants winning in {{wsy|1905}} and the A's in {{wsy|1911}} & {{wsy|1913}}. After becoming the San Francisco Giants and Oakland A's, they met in a fourth Series in {{wsy|1989}} resulting in the A's last world championship (as of 2021).\n\n===New York Yankees===\n{{main|Giants\u2013Yankees rivalry|Subway Series}}\nThough in different leagues, the Giants have also been historical rivals of the Yankees,<ref>{{cite book |last=Stout |first=Glenn |title=Yankees Century: 100 Years of New York Yankees Baseball |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |year=2002 |page=290 |isbn=0-618-08527-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Neft |first=David |author-link=David Neft |title=The Sports Encyclopedia: Baseball 2006 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2006 |page=351 |isbn=0-312-35001-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Wynne |first=Brian|title=The Book of Sports Trophies |publisher=Cornwall Books |year=1984 |page=37}}</ref> starting in New York before the Giants moved to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. Before the institution of [[interleague play]] in 1997, the two teams had little opportunity to play each other except in seven [[World Series]]: {{wsy|1921}}, {{wsy|1922}}, {{wsy|1923}}, {{wsy|1936}}, {{wsy|1937}}, {{wsy|1951}} and {{wsy|1962}}, the Yankees winning last five of the seven Series. The teams have met five times in regular season [[interleague play]]:  In 2002 at the old [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], in 2007 at [[Oracle Park]] (then known as AT&T Park), in 2013, 2016, and 2023 at the current [[Yankee Stadium]], and in 2019 at Oracle Park. The teams' next regular season meetings will occur in 2024.\n\nIn a September 2013 meeting, Yankees 3B [[Alex Rodriguez]] hit a grand slam, breaking [[Lou Gehrig|Lou Gehrig's]] grand slam record.\n\nIn his July 4, 1939 farewell speech ending with the renowned \"Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth\", Yankee slugger [[Lou Gehrig]], who played in 2,130 consecutive games, declared that the Giants were a team he \"would give his right arm to beat, and vice versa\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Lou Gehrig's Farewell Speech |url=http://www.lougehrig.com/about/speech.htm |publisher=LouGehrig.com |access-date=September 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907071610/http://www.lougehrig.com/about/speech.htm |archive-date=September 7, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Baseball Hall of Famers==\nAs of 2021, the [[Major League Baseball Hall of Fame]] has inducted 66 representatives of the Giants (55 players and 11 managers) into the Hall of Fame, more than any other team in the history of baseball.\n[[File:Christy Mathewson, pitcher, New York Giants, ca. 1910.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Christy Mathewson]]]]\n[[File:MelOttGoudeycard.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mel Ott]]]]\n{{Baseball hall of fame list\n|Current Team Name = San Francisco Giants\n|   All Team Names = Giants or Gothams\n|          ColorA# = 000000\n|          ColorB# = FFFFFF\n|          ColorC# = FD5A1E\n|          ColorD# = 000000\n|      Team Name 1 = '''New York Gothams/Giants'''\n|         List 1.1 = [[Dave Bancroft]]<br />[[Jake Beckley]]<br />[[Roger Bresnahan]] *<br />[[Dan Brouthers]]<br />[[Jesse Burkett]]<br />'''[[Roger Connor]]''' *<br />'''[[George Davis (baseball)|George Davis]]''' *<br />[[Leo Durocher]]\n|         List 1.2 = '''[[Buck Ewing]]''' *<br />[[Frankie Frisch]]<br />[[Burleigh Grimes]]<br />[[Gabby Hartnett]]<br />[[Rogers Hornsby]]<br />[[Waite Hoyt]]<br />'''[[Carl Hubbell]]''' *<br />'''[[Monte Irvin]]'''<br />'''[[Travis Jackson]]''' *\n|         List 1.3 = '''[[Tim Keefe]]''' *<br />[[Willie Keeler]]<br />'''[[George Kelly (baseball)|George Kelly]]''' *<br />[[King Kelly]]<br />[[Tony Lazzeri]]<br />'''[[Freddie Lindstrom]]''' *<br />[[Ernie Lombardi]]<br />'''[[Rube Marquard]]''' *<br />'''[[Christy Mathewson]]''' *\n|         List 1.4 = '''[[Joe McGinnity]]''' *<br />'''[[John McGraw]]''' *<br />[[Joe Medwick]]<br />[[Johnny Mize]]<br />[[Hank O'Day]]<br />'''[[Jim O'Rourke (baseball)|Jim O'Rourke]]''' *<br />'''[[Mel Ott]]''' *<br />[[Edd Roush]]<br />[[Amos Rusie]] *\n|         List 1.5 = [[Ray Schalk]]<br />[[Red Schoendienst]]<br />'''[[Bill Terry]]''' *<br />[[John Montgomery Ward]] *<br />'''[[Mickey Welch]]''' *<br />'''[[Hoyt Wilhelm]]'''<br />[[Hack Wilson]]<br />'''[[Ross Youngs]]''' *\n|      Team Name 2 = '''San Francisco Giants'''\n|         List 2.1 = [[Steve Carlton]]<br />[[Gary Carter]]\n|         List 2.2 = '''[[Orlando Cepeda]]''' *<br />[[Rich Gossage]]<br />[[Randy Johnson]]\n|         List 2.3 = '''[[Juan Marichal]]''' *<br />'''[[Willie Mays]]''' *\n|         List 2.4 = '''[[Willie McCovey]]''' *<br />[[Joe Morgan]]<br />'''[[Gaylord Perry]]''' *\n|         List 2.5 = [[Frank Robinson]]<br />[[Duke Snider]]<br />[[Warren Spahn]]\n|      Team Name 3 =\n|         List 3.1 =\n|         List 3.2 =\n|         List 3.3 =\n|         List 3.4 =\n|         List 3.5 =\n|      Team Name 4 =\n|         List 4.1 =\n|         List 4.2 =\n|         List 4.3 =\n|         List 4.4 =\n|         List 4.5 =\n|        Footnote1 = * New York / San Francisco Giants listed as primary team according to the Hall of Fame\n|        Footnote2 = \n|        Footnote3 = \n|        Footnote4 = \n|        Footnote5 = \n|}}\n\n===Ford C.
