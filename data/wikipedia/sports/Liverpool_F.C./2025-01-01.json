The club competes in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of [[English football league system|English football]]. Founded in 1892, the club joined the [[English Football League|Football League]] the following year and has played its home games at [[Anfield]] since its formation. Liverpool is one of the most [[Forbes list of the most valuable football clubs|valuable]] and widely supported clubs in the world.\n\nDomestically, the club has won nineteen [[List of English football champions#Total titles won|league titles]], eight [[FA Cup]]s, a record ten [[EFL Cup|League Cups]] and sixteen [[FA Community Shield]]s. In international competitions, the club [[Liverpool F.C. in international football|has won]] six [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]], three [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cups]], four [[UEFA Super Cup]]s\u2014all English records\u2014and one [[FIFA Club World Cup]]. Liverpool established itself as a major force in domestic football in the 1960s under [[Bill Shankly]], before becoming perennial title challengers at home and abroad under [[Bob Paisley]], [[Joe Fagan]] and [[Kenny Dalglish]] who led the club to a combined eleven league titles and four European Cups through the 1970s and 80s. Liverpool won two further European Cups in [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final|2005]] and [[2019 UEFA Champions League Final|2019]] under the management of [[Rafael Ben\u00edtez]] and [[J\u00fcrgen Klopp]], respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league title in [[2019\u201320 Premier League|2020]], the club's first during the [[Premier League]] era.\n\nAlready nicknamed \"The Reds\", it was under Shankly in the 60s that the team first adopted the distinctive all-red home strip which has been used ever since. Also adopted under Shankly's tenure was the club's anthem \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\". The Reds compete in the local [[Merseyside derby]] against fellow Liverpool club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], often referred to simply as \"The Blues\". As the two most decorated clubs in England, and [[Liverpool\u2013Manchester rivalry|inter-city rivals]], Liverpool also has a [[Liverpool F.C.\u2013Manchester United F.C. rivalry|long-standing rivalry]] with the [[Manchester]] club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].\n\nThe club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The [[Heysel Stadium disaster]], where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the [[1985 European Cup Final]] in Brussels, resulted in 39 deaths, most of which were Italians and [[Juventus]] fans. Liverpool were given a six-year ban from European competitions, and all other English clubs received a five-year ban. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] in 1989, where 97 Liverpool supporters died in a [[crowd crush]] against perimeter fencing, led to the elimination of fenced [[Terrace (stadium)|standing terraces]] in favour of [[all-seater stadium]]s in the top two tiers of English football. Prolonged campaigning for justice saw further coroner's inquests, commissions and independent panels that ultimately exonerated the fans.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Liverpool F.C.
