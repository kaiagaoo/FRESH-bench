Historically, Real Madrid have long been seen as the [[The Establishment|establishment]] club. On the other side, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were always characterized by a ''sentimiento de rebeld\u00eda'', a sense of rebellion, although during the early [[Francisco Franco]] years, it was Atl\u00e9tico that was the preferred team of the regime.

In this vein, Atl\u00e9tico fans were probably the originators, and are the most frequent singers, of the song, sung to the tune of the Real Madrid anthem, ''\"Hala Madrid, hala Madrid, el equipo del gobierno, la verg\u00fcenza del pa\u00eds\"'', \"Go Madrid, go Madrid, the government's team, the country's shame.\"\n\nUntil recently, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid had struggled significantly in the derby, carrying a 14-year winless streak into the [[2012-13 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid season|2012\u201313 season]]. This spell ended, however, on 17 May 2013 after Atl\u00e9tico beat their city rivals 2\u20131 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in the [[2013 Copa del Rey Final]], and continued on 29 September 2013 when they won a 1\u20130 victory, again at the Bernab\u00e9u.\n\n===Barcelona===\n\nAlthough less famous than the Derbi Madrile\u00f1o, a historic rivalry exists between Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and [[Futbol Club Barcelona|Barcelona]], which is also considered one of the \"Classics\" of Spanish football. Once lopsided in favor of the Catalan club, this rivalry has become competitive since the early 2010s, marked by events such as the 2016 Champions League knockout phase where Atletico Madrid upset Barcelona, the controversial departure of [[France national football team|French]] striker [[Antoine Griezmann]] from the Madrid club to the Catalan club in 2019 (and his subsequent return in 2021 amid Barcelona's financial struggles), and the surprise move of [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] to Atl\u00e9tico in 2020, a move which saw the Uruguyan star play a crucial role in the team's championship run.
