The series is self-sanctioned by its parent company, [[IndyCar|INDYCAR, LLC]]., which began in 1996 as the Indy Racing League (IRL) and was created by then [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] owner [[Tony George]] as a competitor to [[Championship Auto Racing Teams]] (CART). In 2008, the IndyCar Series merged with CART's successor, the [[Champ Car World Series]] and the history and statistics of both series, as well as those from its predecessors, were unified.\n\nThe series' premier event is the [[Indianapolis 500]], which was first held in 1911.\n\nHistorically, [[American Championship Car Racing|open wheel racing]] was the most popular{{quantify|date=November 2020}} form of U.S. motorsport nationwide.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} However, an acrimonious split (often referred to by many as \"The Split\") in 1994 between the primary series, CART (later known as [[Champ Car]]), and the owner of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] (the site of the Indy 500), [[Tony George]], led to the formation of the Indy Racing League, now known as [[INDYCAR]], which launched the rival IndyCar Series in 1996. From that point on, the popularity of open wheel racing in the U.S. declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/columns/story?seriesId=1&columnist=oreovicz_john&id=3180918 |title=American open-wheel racing held hostage: Year 13 |first=John |last=Oreovicz |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=January 6, 2008 |access-date=January 6, 2008}}</ref> The feud was settled in 2008 with an agreement to merge the two series under the IndyCar banner, but enormous damage had already been done to the sport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?seriesId=1&id=3259364 |title=After 12 years of conflict, IRL and Champ Car merge |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=February 22, 2008 |access-date=February 22, 2008}}</ref> Post-merger, IndyCar continues to run with slight viewership gains per year.

For 1998\u20131999, the series garnered its first title sponsor, and was advertised as the ''[[Pep Boys]] Indy Racing League''. In 2000, the series sold its [[naming rights]] to Internet search engine [[Northern Light Group|Northern Light]], and the series was named the ''Indy Racing Northern Light Series''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Indy Racing and Northern Light end partnership|publisher=Motorsport.com|url=http://motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=83247|access-date=2010-08-23|date=2002-01-07|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503153328/http://motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=83247|archive-date=2008-05-03}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''IndyCar Series'' was officially adopted beginning in 2003, as the series was now legally entitled to use it due to the expiration of a 1996 legal settlement with [[Championship Auto Racing Teams]] (CART). The series began to progressively downplay the former IRL name, changing its name to simply IndyCar for the 2008 season.

The first new Indycar came into being in 1997. [[Tony George]] specified new technical rules for less expensive cars and production-based engines. The move effectively outlawed the [[Champ Car|CART]] chassis and turbocharged engines that had been the mainstay of the [[Indianapolis 500]] since the late 1970s. [[File:Indy500winningcar2000.JPG|thumb|right|G-Force GF05 IRL car in which [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] won the [[2000 Indianapolis 500]].]]\n\nStarting with the 2003 season, the series rules were changed to require chassis manufacturers to be approved by the league before they could build cars. Prior to that, any interested party could build a car, provided it met the rules and was made available to customers at the league-mandated price. In total, four manufacturers have built IndyCar chassis.\n\nDallara began producing Indycars for the 1997 season. The Dallara and G Force chassis were relatively evenly matched over their first few seasons, but eventually, the Dallara began to win more races. This caused more teams to switch to the Dallara, further increasing their success. As of 2017, a Dallara chassis has been used by 17 Indy 500 winners, although there have not been any competing manufacturers since 2008. Dallara was also tapped to build the [[Firestone Indy Lights]] machines. After the withdrawal of factory support from [[Panoz Auto Development]], they are the only supplier of new chassis.\n\nThe G Force chassis was introduced in 1997 and won the 1997 and 2000 Indy 500 races. In 2002, [[\u00c9lan Motorsport Technologies]] bought G Force, and the chassis was renamed \"Panoz G Force\", and then shortened to \"Panoz\" in 2005. In 2003 a new model was introduced, and it won the Indy 500 in 2003\u20132004 and finished second in 2005. It fell out of favor starting in 2006, and by then, only one had finished in the top ten at Indy. Little factory support was given to IndyCar teams by Panoz after that point, as they had concentrated on their DP01 chassis for the rival Champ Car World Series. By 2008, only one Panoz saw track time, an aborted second-weekend effort at Indy, that resulted in [[Phil Giebler]] being injured in a practice crash.\n\n[[File:JLazierIndy07.jpg|thumb|right|A Panoz GF09 Indycar Series chassis driven by [[Jaques Lazier]] during practice for the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]].]]\n\n[[Riley & Scott]] produced IndyCar chassis from 1997 to 2000. Their initial effort, the Mark V, was introduced late in the 1997 season, severely limiting its potential market. It also proved to be uncompetitive. After Riley & Scott was purchased by Reynard, an all-new model, the Mark VII, was introduced for the 2000 season. It won in Phoenix, the second race of the season (driven by Buddy Lazier), but was off the pace at Indy and was quickly dropped by its teams.\n\nFalcon Cars were founded by [[Michael Kranefuss]] and Ken Anderson in 2002 as the third approved chassis supplier for the 2003 season. One rolling chassis was completed and shown, but it was never fitted with a working engine and never ran. No orders were ever filled. Superficially, IndyCar machines closely resemble those of other open-wheeled formula racing cars, with front and rear [[wing]]s and prominent [[airbox]]es. Originally, the cars were unique, being designed specifically for oval racing; for example, the oil and cooling systems were [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]] to account for the pull of liquids to the right side of the cars. Later cars were designed to accommodate the added requirements of road racing.\n\n[[File:ScottSharpJune2007.jpg|thumbnail|[[Dallara]] IR05 Indycar chassis driven by [[Scott Sharp]] at the [[2007 Bombardier Learjet 550]] at [[Texas Motor Speedway]].]]\n\nBecause of a schedule conflict, the Champ Car World Series spec [[Panoz DP01]], with a [[Cosworth]] engine, was run in an IndyCar Series points event in the 2008 [[Long Beach Grand Prix|Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach]].\n\n====2012\u20132014====\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 120527-A-MG757-086.jpg|thumbnail|2012 DW12 chassis with the Speedway configuration driven by [[J.

The kits, while increasing speeds and offering a clear distinction between the two manufacturers, did lead to significant cost increases. Further, Chevrolet's aero kit was the more dominant with Honda only able to mount a competitive charge on ovals due to having slightly better engine power. While Honda was able to make gains in 2016, after two years of development the kits were frozen for 2017, and starting in 2018 all cars ran the same aero package again. To further help reduce costs, IndyCar allowed teams to shop for competitively priced non-safety-related parts such as brakes instead of mandating parts from specific suppliers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indycar.com/News/2016/09/09-14-Aero-Kits-Future|title=Aero kit development frozen for 2017; Series plans universal car in 2018|access-date=2017-02-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220093149/http://www.indycar.com/News/2016/09/09-14-Aero-Kits-Future|archive-date=2017-02-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIndyCar had hoped to set a new speed record at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway by 2016 with the introduction of aero kits and the development work associated with them. However, after a series of safety concerns during practice for the 2015 Indianapolis 500 with the Chevrolet aero kit package, this did not come about.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/112819|title=IndyCar wants Indianapolis speed record beaten by 2016|first=Mark|last=Glendenning|access-date=2017-02-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220094212/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/112819|archive-date=2017-02-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====2018\u2013present====\nThe 2017 season was the third and final year contested with the [[Chevrolet]] and [[Honda Performance Development|Honda]] aero kits outfitted to the [[Dallara DW12]] chassis. Beginning in 2018, all [[Dallara DW12|DW12]] Safety Cell chassis was fitted with a universal bodywork kit. Digital renderings for the common bodywork kit, referred to as the 'IR18' car, were released in early May 2017 as a second facelift of [[Dallara DW12]]. The car was officially unveiled in late July, and the universal aero kit became known as the UAK18 bodywork. \n[[File:18 Sebastien Bourdais Kohler Grand Prix 2018.jpg|alt=|thumb|The IR18 chassis in its Road Course configuration, driven by [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] during the [[2018 Kohler Grand Prix]] at [[Road America]].]]\nThe bodywork is inspired by [[Champ Car|CART]]'s 1990s and 2000s designs, with a more streamlined appearance. The redesigned aero kit reduces both aerodynamic downforce and team and manufacturer design development costs. The universal Aero Kit was designed without the wheel guards of the DW12 chassis, which were deemed ineffective and proved prone to breaking. The IR-18 also lacks an air inlet above the cockpit, a first for an IndyCar Series chassis (most Champ Car chassis had been designed that way). The new Aero Kit also has fewer small aerodynamic pieces that can become broken or dislodged, with the intent to reduce the amount of debris that ends up on the track and expenses from repairs. The \"aeroscreen\" cockpit protection was added in time for the 2020 season, and some minor modifications were eventually conducted to reduce the intense heat caused by stagnant air on the drivers.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-01-01 |title=INSIGHT: Progress made \u2013 and changes to come \u2013 with IndyCar's aeroscreen |url=https://racer.com/2021/01/01/insight-progress-made-and-changes-to-come-with-indycars-aeroscreen/ |access-date=2022-08-02 |website=RACER |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Transmission, gearbox, and clutch===\nFor the transmission gearboxes, all IndyCar Series cars currently use an electronically actuated ''AGS'' (''Assisted Gearchange System'') 6-speed [[semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic]] [[sequential manual transmission|sequential gearbox]] with an electro-pneumatically operated paddle-shift system and a pneumatic clutch with semi-automatic activation, supplied by [[Xtrac Limited]] since the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.xtrac.com/product/assisted-gearchange-system/ |title=Assisted Gearchange System |website=xtrac.com |access-date=October 9, 2021 }}</ref> All current IndyCar transmissions use [[Pneumatic actuator|pneumatic actuation]] for the shifting and clutch, so the clutch is therefore only needed for launching the car from a standstill, and the clutch isn't required for gear shifting. From 1996 to 2007, all IndyCar Series cars used a hand-shifted 6-speed [[sequential manual transmission]] with a shift stick lever, supplied also by Xtrac since 2000 season until 2007. The clutches of all IndyCar Series cars are carbon with steel housing 3-plate clutch operated by foot-pedal in 1996\u20132011 later hand-paddle steering wheel clutch in 2012\u2013present and provided by [[AP Racing]]. Mechanical limited-slip differentials are also allowed and constant velocity joint tripod driveshafts are also used. All IndyCar Series car drivetrains are currently [[rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|rear mid-engine with rear-wheel-drive layout]].\n\n===Brakes===\nSince the formation of IndyCar Series in 1996, the brake package for the IndyCar Series was slimmer carbon brake rotors with 4-pot brake calipers and carbon pads on all-oval races until 2011. The thicker steel brake rotors with 6-pot brake calipers and carbon pads were introduced in 2005 for road and street course races for stronger braking while approaching sharper turns even hairpins. From 2012 onwards, IndyCar Series ditched the steel brake discs in favor of carbon brake rotors on all types of tracks but the caliper configuration remained the same as 1996\u20132011.\n\nPFC currently supplying brake packages for all IndyCar Series cars since 2017 season (disc only) and later increased their involvement from the 2018 season (supplying the calipers and rest of other brake packages). Previously Brembo supplied the brake packages in 2012\u20132016 (full brake package), 2017 (caliper only), and Alcon in 2003\u20132011.\n\n===Wheel rims===\n[[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG|BBS]] and [[OZ Group|O.Z. Racing]] have been supplying forged wheels since 1996. The wheel rims for all IndyCar Series cars are made of aluminum alloy. The size of IndyCar Series wheel rims have been {{convert|10|x|15|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the front and {{convert|14|x|15|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the rear since 1996; this size will be used until at least the 2022 season. 18-inch wheel rims will be adopted if the [[Dallara DW12]]'s successor comes out for the 2023 season onward.\n\n===Tires===\n[[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] is the tire supplier for the series since the 1996 season and later increased to current sole tire partner and supplier since 2000 season. Previously, [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] had also supplied tires from 1996 to 1999 for several teams, before withdrawing their support. The IndyCar Series runs the bespoke compounds since 1996 and re-profiled in 2003. The front tire sizes are 305/45-R15 (10.0/25.8-R15) and the rear tire sizes are 415/40-R15 (14.5/28.0-R15). The compounds and construction of IndyCar Series tires unique to each mounting position on the race car. For road/street events, there are unique primary and alternative specifications for dry conditions, along with specially designed rain tires for wet conditions.  For oval racing, a single set of specifications is used, based upon the configuration and speed of the track, as well as having the right rear tire diameter constructed to be slightly larger than the left rear, (also known as stagger) to aid in high speed cornering.\n\n===Suspension===\nThe suspension of all IndyCar Series cars is double A-arm, pushrod, with third spring and anti-roll bar configuration multilink.\n\n===Cockpit and safety components===\n[[File:Sage karam cockpit (47966366346).jpg|left|thumb|Cosworth CCW Mk2 steering wheel in the cockpit of [[Sage Karam]]'s car.]]\n[[File:Aeroscreen on Juan Pablo Montoya Dallara DW-12 UAK-18.jpg|thumb|Aeroscreen on [[Juan Pablo Montoya]]'s car.]]\nAll NTT IndyCar Series cars use carbon-fiber shell driver's seats with 6-point safety restraints. The cars' steering wheels are designed by [[Cosworth]] with a system of buttons that allow the drivers to make adjustments to their cars mid-race. All IndyCar Series cars were equipped with Pi Research Sigma Wheel to Display data display units from 2001\u20132017 until they were replaced by Cosworth's Configurable Display Unit 4.3 display from 2018 onwards (although in 2018 some smaller low-budget IndyCar Series teams still utilized old Pi Research Sigma Wheel instead of new Cosworth Configurable Display Unit 4.3 due to cost reasons).\n\nThe cockpits of all IndyCar Series cars are still open but protected by zylon, a foot protection bulkhead, and cockpit padding.\n\nFrom the 2020 season onwards, the IndyCar Series implemented a cockpit protection system. This consists of a combination of the [[Halo (safety device)|Halo]] mandated in Formula One and a reinforced windscreen dubbed the \"aeroscreen\", provided by Red Bull Advanced Technologies, to lessen the probability of traumatic head injuries from flying debris.<ref>{{cite web|title=INDYCAR Announces Plan For Cockpit Protection Innovation|url=http://www.indycar.com/News/2019/05/05-24-Aeroscreen-Red-Bull-announcement|work=IndyCar.com|publisher=IndyCar Series|date=May 24, 2019|access-date=June 7, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Other components===\nAll IndyCar Series cars carry an Electronic Control Unit. Live telemetry is used only for television broadcasts, but the data can be recorded from the ECU to the computer if the car is in the garage tents and not on the track. Since 2007 [[McLaren Applied Technologies|McLaren]] supplied its' Engine Control Unit (ECU) system for few IndyCar Series teams and later promoted to standard Engine Control Unit (ECU) systems from 2010 season onwards. Previously [[Motorola]] supplied IndyCar Series ECU in 2003\u20132009 for [[Honda Performance Development|Honda]]-powered cars, also [[Denso]] supplied IndyCar Series ECU in 2003\u20132005 for [[Toyota Racing Development|Toyota]]-powered cars and also [[Zytek Engineering|Zytek]] supplied IndyCar Series ECU in 2002\u20132005 for [[Chevrolet]]-powered cars.\n\nRearview mirrors for all IndyCar Series cars are fully mandated to easily enable viewing opponents behind.\n\n===Fuel===\n====Methanol====\nAt its inception, the IRL used [[methanol]] racing fuel, which had been the de facto standard in American open-wheel racing since the [[1964 Indianapolis 500]] [[Eddie Sachs]] - [[Dave MacDonald]] crash. Methanol had long provided a safer alternative to gasoline. It had a higher flash point, was easily extinguishable with water, and burned invisible. With the IRL's introduction of night races in 1997, the burning of methanol fuel was visible for the first time, seen with a light blue haze. With this in mind, in an effort to make it more visible in case of fire during daylight hours, additional mixtures were placed in the fuel. As a safety feature, the methanol would burn with color.\n\n====Ethanol====\nIn 2005, the driver [[Paul Dana]] brought the sponsorship of the Ethanol Promotion and Information Council (EPIC) to his IndyCar team. EPIC is a consortium of ethanol producers that advocate the increased use of [[ethanol]]. EPIC was anxious to address public concerns of that era that ethanol use led to engine damage and poor performance when used in road cars. As a marketing effort, it was believed that sponsoring an IndyCar could be used as a tool to promote education and awareness of ethanol use and to curb the spread of erroneous information.\n\nDana was killed in a crash in 2006, but the IRL had already begun a transition to [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures|ethanol fuel]]. For the 2006 season the fuel was a 90%/10% mixture of [[Methanol fuel|methanol]] and [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures|ethanol]]. Starting in 2007, the league advertised \"[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|100% Fuel Grade Ethanol]],\" the first competitive series to utilize renewable fuel. The mixture was actually 98% ethanol and 2% gasoline, provided by [[Lifeline Foods]] of [[Saint Joseph, Missouri]]. The additives satisfy the U.S. government's demand that the alcohol is unfit for human consumption and add visible color in case of fire. However, 2010 [[S\u00e3o Paulo Indy 300]], held in Brazil \u2013outside of the U.S. regulations\u2013 utilized a full [[Neat ethanol fuel|E100]] mixture, the first instance in the sport.\n\nTo compensate for the loss of power due to the use of ethanol, the displacement was increased back to 3.5 liters.  Since ethanol gets better fuel mileage than methanol, the fuel tanks in the car were decreased.\n\nCompared to methanol, human contact with the current ICS fuel is much less harsh, and the fumes much less irritating.  The fumes are often compared with the sweet smell of apple cider or apple cobbler.  Unlike methanol, ethanol is not caustic and does not cause chemical burns when it comes in contact with the skin.  It also is less polluting when spilled compared to methanol.\n\nIn May 2010, [[Sunoco]] became the official fuel of the series starting in mid-2010 with an immediate effect, running through 2018.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.speedwaydigest.com/index.php/news/speedway-news/22457-sunoco-named-official-fuel-for-indianapolis-motor-speedway-and-extends-role-as-official-fuel-of-indycar-in-new-multi-year-agreement\n|title=Sunoco named official fuel for Indianapolis Motor Speedway and extends role as official fuel of INDYCAR in new multi-year agreement\n|work=IndyCar Series\n|publisher=speedwaydigest.com\n|date=2010-03-03\n|access-date=2010-03-03}}</ref> For the 2012 season, the ethanol fuel blend rate was reduced to 85% blend in a reference of road car relevance. [[Speedway LLC]] took over as series official fuel supplier beginning from 2019 season onwards, but the E85 formula still retained until at 2022.\n\nFrom 2023 onwards [[Shell USA]] (North American division of [[Shell plc]]) will supply 100% Ethanol-sourced fuel for the first time since 2011.\n\n====Fuel cell====\nThe fuel cell for all current IndyCar Series cars are made of rubber and are covered with a Kevlar-fitted blanket for extra protection in side impacts. Since 2012 the capacity has been {{Convert|18.5|usgal|L|0|lk=on|abbr=off}}. Previous capacities were {{Convert|22|usgal|L|0|lk=on|abbr=off}} in 2007\u20132011, {{Convert|30|usgal|L|0|lk=on|abbr=off}} in 2004\u20132006, and {{Convert|35|usgal|L|0|lk=on|abbr=off}} in 1997\u20132003.\n\n===Engines===\n====First generation (1996)====\n=====Engine competition era (1996)=====\nThe initial 1996 IRL season, as well as the first two races of the 1996\u201397 season, featured engines with specifications leftover from the rival CART series competition. Those chassis/engine combinations were essentially under the same rules utilized by teams that participated in the [[1995 Indianapolis 500]], which was sanctioned by USAC. V-8 powerplants were allowed the typical {{convert|45|inHg|bar psi|1|abbr=on}} of pressure boost. The Menard-Buick V6 engine used in 1996, however, was an updated powerplant from the 1995 version. In addition, the V-6 stock block engines (Buick-Menard) were allowed {{convert|55|inHg|bar psi|1|abbr=on}} of boost at all races, instead of just at Indianapolis. During the CART era, V-6 stock blocks were only allowed {{convert|45|inHg|bar psi|1|abbr=on}} at all races outside of Indy, which was a decided disadvantage and left the engine out of favor.\n\n[[Ford-Cosworth]] reluctantly provided support to teams wishing to run their older-spec engines in the IRL, a major point of contention for CART management, to whom Ford-Cosworth was an official engine supplier. The [[Ilmor#The 265 V8|Ilmor Mercedes]] V-8 engine, also a mainstay CART powerplant, was permitted, but the only time it was used as a one-off at the 1996 Indy 500 by [[Galles Racing]].\n\n====Second generation (1997\u20132011)====\n=====Engine competition era (1997\u20132005)=====\n{{main|Oldsmobile Aurora Indy V8 engine|Nissan VH engine|Chevrolet Indy V8|Toyota Indy V8|Honda Indy V8 engine}}\n[[File:AlexBarronGarage2007Indy500.jpg|thumb|right|Honda Indy V8 engine on the car]]\nStarting in 1997, IRL cars were powered by 4.0-litre [[V8 engine|V8]], four-stroke piston, Otto cycle [[methanol]]-burning, production prototype-based, naturally-aspirated internal combustion engines and electronic indirect multi-point port fuel injection, produced by [[General Motors]] (under the [[Oldsmobile]] [[Oldsmobile Aurora|Aurora]] label) and [[Nissan]] (badged as Infiniti). Per IRL rules, the engines sold for no more than $80,000 (with an exception of full-works IndyCar Series teams that usually received free engines due to direct partnership with an each engine manufacturer), and were rev-limited to over 10,000 rpm and weighed up to {{Convert|280|lb|kg|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} (excl. headers, clutch, ECU, spark box or filters).<ref name=autoworld>{{cite news|title=IRL Aurora V8|publisher=Autoworld.com|url=http://www.autoworld.com/news/Oldsmobile/IRL_Aurora.htm|access-date=2010-08-23|date=2001-03-29|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108015047/http://www.autoworld.com/news/Oldsmobile/IRL_Aurora.htm|archive-date=2010-01-08}}</ref> They produced around {{convert|600-700|hp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"autoworld\" /> These engines utilized [[Crossplane|90\u00b0 crankshafts]], and while the engine blocks were to be production-based, they were not \"stock blocks\" like the Buick or Menard engines of the 1980s and 1990s. They were purpose-built racing engines.\n\nThe engine formula was changed with the 2000\u20132004 formula. The displacement was dropped down from {{Convert|4.0|to|3.5|L|cuin|0|lk=on|abbr=off}}, and the requirement for the block to be production-based was dropped. The engines also switched to [[Flat-plane crank|180\u00b0 crankshafts]], and the rev limits were adjusted from time to time. These engines made {{convert|675|hp|abbr=on}}, ran on 109-[[Octane rating|octane]] [[methanol]] racing fuel, and revved to 10,300 rpm, all while weighing only {{convert|280|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/rpm/irl/2003/0520/1556796.html |title=Fun facts about IndyCars |last=Rife |first=Tom |work=ESPN |date=May 20, 2003 |access-date=April 19, 2022}}</ref> This formula was used through 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=IRL Engine Specifications Announced for 2000\u20132004 Seasons|publisher=Motorsport.com|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=22997&FS=IRL|access-date=2010-08-23|date=1998-11-17|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606181110/http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=22997&FS=IRL|archive-date=2011-06-06}}</ref> In 2004, in the wake of several crashes including the fatal crash of [[Tony Renna]] and the severe crash of [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]], the displacement was reduced to 3.0-liters using the existing engine blocks to curb top speeds (started from the [[2004 Indianapolis 500]]).\n\nInfiniti's engines, though reliable, were significantly down on power compared to the Auroras in 1997, leading many of the teams that had initially opted for the Infiniti to switch. By the end of the 1998 season, only a handful of low-budget teams were using the Infiniti. However, early in the 1999 season, [[Cheever Racing]], a well-funded team, was brought on to develop the engine with team owner [[Eddie Cheever]] expanding the team to two cars and bringing on his brother [[Ross Cheever]] as a test driver. By 2000, the engine had improved markedly and Cheever captured the marque's first win at [[Pikes Peak International Raceway]]. However, despite the improved success, few teams made the switch to the Infiniti and the company left the series after the 2002 season to focus on powering the league's new [[Infiniti Pro Series]] (now Firestone Indy Lights).\n\nAs part of General Motors' discontinuance of the Oldsmobile name, the Olds engine was rebadged as the Chevrolet starting with the 2002 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chevy revs for 2002 IRL season|publisher=SAE Intl.|url=http://www.sae.org/automag/techbriefs/03-2002/|access-date=2010-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505083628/http://www.sae.org/automag/techbriefs/03-2002/|archive-date=2013-05-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, the effort would lack in competitiveness against Toyota and Honda, which came to the IRL in 2003 from the rival CART series. In August 2003, Chevrolet announced to the public its \"Gen IV\" motor, a rebadged [[Cosworth]] motor for competition. At the time, Cosworth was owned by Ford. On November 4, 2004, Chevrolet stated that it would be ending its IRL engine program effective with the end of the 2005 season, citing costs that exceeded value, according to then [[General Motors|GM]] Racing Director Doug Duchardt, \"The investment did not meet our objectives.\"\n\nToyota won its first race in Miami, as well as the Indianapolis 500 and the series title. However, Toyota had just one podium in the last seven races of 2004, and only Penske Racing fielded competitive Toyota-powered cars in 2005, while Honda became the dominant engine manufacturer within the series. In November 2005, Toyota company officials announced the company's withdrawal from American open-wheel racing and the immediate discontinuation of its IRL program, coinciding with its entrance into [[Craftsman Truck Series|NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series]] in 2004, and its discontinuation of its [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] program.\n\n=====Single-manufacturer spec engine era (2006\u20132011)=====\n{{main|Honda Indy V8}}\nAfter [[Chevrolet]] and [[Toyota Racing Development|Toyota]] elected to shut down their IRL involvement after 2005 season ([[Chevrolet]] temporarily hiatus from IndyCar Series for six years while [[Toyota Racing Development|Toyota]] USA elected to focus on [[NASCAR]] involvement), Honda became the only standard spec-engine manufacturer in the IndyCar Series starting in 2006 and continued in that capacity through 2011 as it was announced by Indy Racing League president & chief operating officer Brian Barnhart and [[Honda Performance Development]] president Robert Clarke on December 15, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Honda to Serve as Single IndyCar Engine Supplier in 2006|url=https://hondanews.com/en-US/releases/honda-to-serve-as-single-indycar-engine-supplier-in-2006?page=227&page_size=20|work= HondaNews.com |date=December 15, 2005|access-date=December 15, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=IRL: Series names Honda as sole engine supplier|url=http://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/irl-series-names-honda-as-sole-engine-supplier/207207/|work= Motorsport.com |date=December 15, 2005|access-date=December 15, 2005}}</ref> The IndyCar Series carried on with only one engine manufacturer in spite of the television agreement required at least two or three engine manufacturers to participate in the series to ensure future continuity. The Honda Indy V8 engine was partnered and co-developed by [[Ilmor]], which is part owned by [[Roger Penske]] for tune-up, engine maintenance, arrangement and trackside support. The engine displacement was reverted from {{Convert|3.0|to|3.5|L|cuin|0|lk=on|abbr=off}} beginning from 2007 season.\n\nDuring that time, since the IndyCar Series had only one engine manufacturer, Honda focused on minimizing engine failure and minimizing costs instead of defeating rivals. As such, the engines were moderately de-tuned. The engines proved themselves to be quite durable \u2014 there had been no engine failures at Indy from 2006 to 2010, which also lowered the number of crashes.

Alongside the prestigious [[Indy 500]], the 1-mile oval tracks of Phoenix and Loudon were added to the schedule. In addition, the Hulman family oversaw the planning for the construction of a new track at Walt Disney World in Florida. On the new [[Walt Disney World Speedway]] the first IRL race took place in January 1996.\n\nAfter the series was established, ovals used mainly by NASCAR were raced on. These included the newly built racetracks in Las Vegas and Fort Worth as well as the existing speedways of Charlotte and Atlanta. After a series of major accidents at Charlotte and Atlanta and a lack of spectator turnout, however, the ovals of Atlanta, Charlotte, and Las Vegas were removed from the calendar. For the 2001 season, the IRL also began to race on ovals that were being used by CART. The circuits of Homestead and Gateway changed from CART to the calendar of the IRL, with the race at Walt Disney World being dropped in favor of Homestead. In addition, the new 1.5-mile ovals of Kansas, Kentucky, and Chicagoland were added. These tracks were the backbone of the IRL until 2011. After [[Roger Penske]] sold his racetracks (Fontana, Michigan, and Nazareth) to the [[International Speedway Corporation]], the IRL began racing at these tracks in the 2002 season. [[Nazareth Speedway]] only held three races before ISC closed the track in 2004. Michigan Speedway was raced until the 2007 season and the Auto Club Speedway, formerly California Speedway, until the 2015 season.\n\nThe first major change took place in the 2005 season. For the first time in the history of the IRL, races were held at road and street courses. A street course race in St. Petersburg has been added to the calendar. In addition, races at Sonoma and Watkins Glen, the two NASCAR road course circuits were added. In 2007, the [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course]] was added. After the Champ Car World Series was dissolved in 2008, some of their races were taken over by the IndyCar Series. These are the street races of Long Beach, Detroit, and Toronto, and starting in 2016, Road America. In addition, a road course race at [[Barber Motorsports Park]] in Birmingham and an oval race at [[Iowa Speedway]] were scheduled and held.\n\nThe second big change took place in the 2012 season. In 2011, the series returned to [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] for the first time since 2000. However, the circuit had been rebuilt for NASCAR, increasing the banking of 12 degrees to progressive banking up to 20 degrees. This new configuration led to tight [[pack racing]]. Additionally, a $5 million bonus was offered if a driver from another series or racing discipline win the race, as it would be the last race for the current chassis, and a record 34 cars entered this race (the Indy 500 field, by comparison, is capped at 33 cars). As a result of pack racing in combination with many cars and inexperienced drivers, a major crash occurred on lap 11, injuring several drivers and resulting in the death of defending Indy 500 winner [[Dan Wheldon]]. This event led to massive media criticism of oval races for open-wheel vehicles. As a result, and also because of the gradual loss of spectators in the previous seasons, all oval races on 1.5-mile speedways, except Texas Motor Speedway, were removed from the calendar. Only the oval races in Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Iowa, Texas, and Fontana remained for the next three seasons. Instead, more races were held in cities, including Houston, Baltimore, and S\u00e3o Paulo. In the following years, the calendar stabilized, with the return of races in Phoenix, Pocono, and Gateway, although the races at Fontana, Pocono, Phoenix, and Milwaukee were later removed from the schedule due to insufficient crowds or severe crashes, including the fatal crash of [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]] at Pocono in 2015.\n\nSince the 2012 season, the calendar has roughly consisted of 1/3 of oval races, 1/3 of races on permanent natural road courses, and 1/3 of races on temporary street courses in larger cities. In 2019, an IndyCar race was held for the first time on a current Formula 1 racetrack, the \"Indycar Classics\" at the [[Circuit of the Americas]] in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\nDue to government restrictions on major events in 2020 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], many races that were scheduled for the 2020 season were affected. For the first time since 1911, the Indianapolis 500 was not held on the traditional Sunday before Memorial Day. In addition, traditional street races in Long Beach, Detroit, and Toronto were canceled. As compensation, double-header races took place in Road America, Iowa, Mid-Ohio, and Gateway.\n\n==Teams==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Team || Manufacturer || Base || Founding year\n|-\n| [[A. J.

The winner of a race gets 50 points. The top four drivers are separated by ten, five and three points respectively. The fourth through tenth-place finishers are separated by two points each. Eleventh through twenty-fifth are separated by one point each. All other drivers who start the race score five points. Bonus points are awarded as follows: one point to the driver that earns the pole each race (except at Indianapolis), one point to any driver that leads at least one lap in a race, and two additional bonus points to the driver that leads the most laps each race.\n\nFor the Indianapolis 500, qualifying points are awarded for all 33 cars at the Indianapolis 500. The point scale slides based on the teams that qualify for the top-nine shootout, then descending by speed and position.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2022, the Indianapolis 500 awarded double points for all finishing positions. Beginning in 2023, double points were dropped and drivers earned the same points as any other race.\n\nIn the case of a tie, the IndyCar Series will determine the champion based on the most first-place finishes. If there is still a tie, IndyCar Series will determine the champion by the most second-place finishes, then the most third-place finishes, etc., until a champion is determined. IndyCar Series will apply the same system to other ties in the rankings at the close of the season and at any other time during the season.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasons==\n{{further|List of American open-wheel racing national champions|List of American Championship Car Rookie of the Year Winners}}\n\nThe following table is a list of championships going only as far back as the latest sanctioning body's existence. However, championships that took place before that period (under previously existed sanctioning bodies) are also counted as part of one continuous championship following the merger of [[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART]]/[[Champ Car World Series|Champ Car]] into the [[IndyCar|Indy Racing League]] in 2008.

The two primary disciplines of IndyCar ([[Oval track racing|ovals]] and [[Road racing|road courses]]) were named after respective legends of the sport: \n[[A. J. Foyt]] and [[Mario Andretti]], respectively. The discipline trophies were created as the series moved closer to a 50/50 split of oval and road races, and to encourage incentive for part-time entries&nbsp;\u2013 specifically, those that might prefer to compete in one discipline over the other.\n\nThis arrangement also creates a reasonable opportunity for a team to employ the services of two drivers for one season entry. A team could hire a specialist for ovals and a [[Road course ringer|specialist]] for road/street courses, who combined would maintain the entry's total owner points but individually work towards their own separate disciplines.\n\nNote that [[Street circuit|street courses]] are included as part of the road racing discipline. Since 2013, the individual discipline trophies have received markedly less fanfare.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n!Season\n![[A. J.
