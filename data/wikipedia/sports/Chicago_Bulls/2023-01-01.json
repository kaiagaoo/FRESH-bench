They are known for having one of the NBA's greatest dynasties, winning six [[List of NBA champions|NBA championships]] between 1991 and 1998 with two [[three-peat]]s. All six of their championship teams were led by [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]rs [[Michael Jordan]], [[Scottie Pippen]], and coach [[Phil Jackson]]. The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships while never losing an [[NBA Finals]] series in their history.<ref>Jozsa, J. P.

The Bulls were the first team in NBA history to win 70 games or more in a single season, and the only NBA franchise to do so until the 2015\u201316 Warriors.<ref>{{cite news |title=Warriors Become Second Team in NBA History to Win 70 Games in a Single Season |url=http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/70-wins-20160407 |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |website=Warriors.com |date=April 7, 2016 |access-date=December 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223133724/http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/70-wins-20160407|archive-date=December 23, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince 1998, the Bulls have failed to regain their former success. The franchise struggled throughout the 2000s, but showed promise in the early 2010s led by [[Derrick Rose]] and [[Joakim Noah]], culminating in back-to-back seasons above .732 in [[2010\u201311 Chicago Bulls season|2010\u201311]] and [[2011\u201312 Chicago Bulls season|2011\u201312]]. The injury to Rose and subsequent trades of key players triggered a rebuild, culminating in the current lineup built around all-stars [[Zach LaVine]], [[DeMar DeRozan]] and [[Nikola Vucevic]]. \n\nJordan and Rose have won the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] while playing for the Bulls, for a total of six MVP awards. The Bulls share rivalries with the [[Bulls\u2013Cavaliers rivalry|Cleveland Cavaliers]], [[Bulls\u2013Pistons rivalry|Detroit Pistons]], [[Miami Heat]], and the [[Bulls\u2013Knicks rivalry|New York Knicks]]. The Bulls' rivalry with the Pistons was highlighted heavily during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Outside of basketball, the Chicago Bulls are also known for their community work through their charity department which provides youth and non-for-profit organizations with tickets to games and merchandise.\n\n==Franchise history==\n===1966\u20131975: Team creation and early success===\nOn January 16, 1966, [[Chicago]] was granted an NBA franchise to be called the Bulls. The Chicago Bulls became the third NBA franchise in the city, after the [[Chicago Stags]] (1946\u20131950) and the Chicago Packers/Zephyrs (1961\u20131963, now the [[Washington Wizards]]). The Bulls' founder, [[Dick Klein (basketball)|Dick Klein]], was the Bulls' only owner to ever play professional basketball (for the [[Chicago American Gears]]). He served as the Bulls' general manager and president in their initial years. \n\nAfter the [[1966 NBA Expansion Draft]], the newly founded Chicago Bulls were allowed to acquire players from the previously established teams in the league for the upcoming 1966\u201367 season. The team started during the [[1966\u201367 NBA season|1966\u201367 season]], and posted a 33\u201348 record, the best by an expansion team in NBA history. Coached by Chicagoan and former NBA star [[Johnny \"Red\" Kerr]], and led by former NBA assist leader [[Guy Rodgers]], guard [[Jerry Sloan]] and forward [[Bob Boozer]], the Bulls qualified for the playoffs, the only NBA team to do so in their inaugural season.\n\n[[File:Chicago bulls 1969-70 team.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|The 1969\u201370 Chicago Bulls]]\nIn their first season, the Bulls played their home games at the [[International Amphitheatre]], before moving to [[Chicago Stadium]].\n\nFan interest was diminishing after four seasons, with one game in the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1967\u201368 season]] having an official attendance of 891 and some games being played in [[Kansas City]]. In 1969, Klein dropped out of the general manager job and hired [[Pat Williams (basketball)|Pat Williams]], who as the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]' business manager created promotions that helped the team become third in attendance the previous season. Williams revamped the team roster, acquiring [[Chet Walker]] from Philadelphia in exchange for [[Jim Washington]] and drafting [[Norm Van Lier]] \u2013 who was traded to the [[Cincinnati Royals]] and only joined the Bulls in 1971 \u2013 while also investing in promotion, with actions such as creating mascot [[Benny the Bull]]. The Bulls under Williams and head coach [[Dick Motta]] qualified for four straight playoffs and had attendances grow to over 10,000.<ref name=pat>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Sam |title=Pat Williams Helped Save Pro Basketball in Chicago |url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/history/pat-williams-helped-save-pro-basketball-chicago.html |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |website=Bulls.com |date=September 1, 2012 |access-date=December 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629213859/https://www.nba.com/bulls/history/pat-williams-helped-save-pro-basketball-chicago.html|archive-date=June 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1972, the Bulls set a franchise win\u2013loss record at 57 wins and 25 losses. During the 1970s, the Bulls relied on [[Jerry Sloan]], forwards [[Bob Love]] and [[Chet Walker]], point guard [[Norm Van Lier]], and centers [[Clifford Ray]] and [[Tom Boerwinkle]]. The team made the conference finals in 1975 but lost to the eventual champions, the [[Golden State Warriors]], 4 games to 3.\n\nAfter four 50-win seasons, Williams returned to Philadelphia, and Motta decided to take on the role of GM as well. The Bulls ended up declining, winning only 24 games in the 1975\u201376 season. Motta was fired and replaced by [[Ed Badger]].<ref name=pat/>\n\n===1976\u20131984: Gilmore and Theus duo===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2022}}\n[[File:Artis Gilmore 1977.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.79|Gilmore in 1977]]\nKlein sold the Bulls to the Wirtz Family, longtime owners of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. Indifferent to NBA basketball, the new ownership group infamously implemented a shoestring budget, putting little time and investment into improving the team.\n\n[[Artis Gilmore]], acquired in the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] dispersal draft in 1976, led a Bulls squad which included guard [[Reggie Theus]], forward [[David Greenwood]] and forward [[Orlando Woolridge]].\n\nIn 1979, the Bulls lost a coin flip for the right to select first in the NBA draft ([[Rod Thorn]], the Bulls' General Manager, called \"heads\"). Had the Bulls won the toss, they would have selected [[Magic Johnson]]; instead, they selected [[David Greenwood]] with the second pick. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] selected Johnson with the pick acquired from the [[New Orleans Jazz (NBA team)|New Orleans Jazz]], who traded the selection for [[Gail Goodrich]].\n\nAfter Gilmore was traded to the San Antonio Spurs for center [[Dave Corzine]], the Bulls employed a high-powered offense centered around Theus, and which soon included guards [[Quintin Dailey]] and [[Ennis Whatley]]. However, with continued dismal results, the Bulls decided to change direction, trading Theus to the [[Kansas City Kings]] during the [[1983\u201384 NBA season|1983\u201384 season]]. Attendance began to dwindle, with the Wirtz Family looking to sell to ownership groups interested in moving the team out of Chicago, before selling to local ownership.\n\n===1984\u20131993: Michael Jordan era begins===\n[[File:Jordan by Lipofsky 16577.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Jordan]] was drafted third overall by the Bulls in [[1984 NBA draft|1984]]. He won six championships and six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]]s for Chicago.]]\nIn the summer of 1984, the Bulls had the third pick of the [[1984 NBA draft]], after Houston and Portland. The [[Houston Rockets|Rockets]] selected [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], the [[Portland Trail Blazers|Blazers]] picked [[Sam Bowie]] and the Bulls chose shooting guard [[Michael Jordan]]. The team, with new management in owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] and general manager [[Jerry Krause]], decided to rebuild around Jordan. Jordan set franchise records during his rookie campaign for scoring (third in the league) and steals (fourth), and led the Bulls back to [[1985 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they lost in four games to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. For his efforts, he was rewarded with a selection to the All-NBA Second Team and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nIn the following off-season, the team acquired point guard [[John Paxson]] and on draft day traded with the Cavaliers for the rights to power forward [[Charles Oakley]]. Along with Jordan and center [[Dave Corzine]], they provided much of the Bulls' offense for the next two years. After suffering a broken foot early in the [[1985\u201386 NBA season|1985\u201386 season]], Jordan finished second on the team to Woolridge in scoring. Jordan returned for [[1986 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], and led the eighth-place Bulls against the 67\u201315 [[Boston Celtics]], led by [[Larry Bird]]. At the time, the Bulls had the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.<ref>{{cite news |title=Worst Records of Playoff Teams |date=April 28, 1986 |newspaper=[[The Sporting News]] |page=46}}</ref> Though the Bulls were swept, Jordan recorded a playoff single-game record 63 points in Game 2 (which still stands to this day), prompting Bird to call him 'God disguised as Michael Jordan.'\n\nIn the [[1986\u201387 NBA season|1986\u201387 season]], Jordan continued his assault on the record books, leading the league in scoring with 37.1 points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First Team. The Bulls finished 40\u201342, which was good enough to qualify them for the playoffs. However, they were again swept by the Celtics in [[1987 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]].\n\nIn the [[1987 NBA draft|1987 draft]], to address their lack of depth, Krause selected center [[Olden Polynice]] eighth overall and power forward [[Horace Grant]] 10th overall, then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the fifth selection, [[small forward]] [[Scottie Pippen]]. With Paxson and Jordan in the backcourt, [[Brad Sellers]] and Oakley at the forward spots, Corzine anchoring center, and [[rookie]]s Pippen and Grant coming off the bench, the Bulls won 50 games and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals, where they were beaten by the eventual Eastern Conference Champions [[Detroit Pistons]] in five games. For his efforts, Jordan was named NBA [[Most Valuable Player]], an award he would win four more times over his career. The 1987\u201388 season would also mark the start of the Pistons-Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988 to 1991.\n\nThe [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988\u201389 season]] marked a second straight year of major off-season moves. Power forward [[Charles Oakley]], who had led the league in total rebounds in both 1987 and 1988, was traded on the eve of the [[1988 NBA draft]] to the [[New York Knicks]] along with a first-round draft pick used by the Knicks to select [[Rod Strickland]] for center [[Bill Cartwright]] and a first-round pick, which the Bulls used to obtain center [[Will Perdue]]. In addition, the Bulls acquired three-point shooter [[Craig Hodges]] from Phoenix. The new starting lineup of Paxson, Jordan, Pippen, Grant, and Cartwright took some time to mesh, winning fewer games than the previous season, but made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the NBA champion Pistons.\n\nIn [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]], Jordan led the league in scoring for the fourth straight season and was joined on the all-star squad for the first time by Pippen. There was also a major change during the off-season, where head coach [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] was replaced by assistant coach [[Phil Jackson]]. The Bulls also picked up rookie center [[Stacey King]] and rookie point guard [[B. J. Armstrong]] in the [[1989 NBA draft|1989 draft]]. With these additional players and the previous year's starting five, the Bulls again made it to the Conference Finals and pushed the Pistons to seven games before being eliminated for the third straight year, the Pistons going on to repeat as NBA champions.\n\n====1990\u20131993: First championship three-peat====\n[[File:Jordan vs lakers nba finals 1991.jpg|thumb|upright=0.72|Michael Jordan v [[Los Angeles Lakers]] at the [[1991 NBA Finals]]]]\nIn the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]], the Bulls recorded a then-franchise record 61 wins, and romped through [[1991 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they swept the Knicks in the first round, defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the semifinals, and then swept the defending champion Pistons in the Conference Finals, then winning the [[1991 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] in five games over the [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nThe Bulls won their second straight title in {{nbafy|1992}} after racking up another franchise record for wins with 67. They swept the [[Miami Heat]] in the first round, defeated the Knicks in seven games in the second round, then the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in six games in the third round, advancing to the [[1992 NBA Finals|Finals]] for the second year in a row where they defeated the [[Clyde Drexler]]-led [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in six games.\n\nIn {{nbafy|1993}}, the Bulls won their third consecutive championship by defeating the [[Atlanta Hawks]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[New York Knicks]] in the first three rounds of the playoffs and then defeating regular-season MVP [[Charles Barkley]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the Finals, with Paxson's three-pointer with 3.9 seconds left giving them a 99\u201398 victory in Game 6 in Phoenix.\n\n===1993\u20131995: Jordan's first retirement===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2022}}\n[[File:United Center 060716.jpg|thumb|[[United Center]]]]\nOn October 6, 1993, [[Michael Jordan]] shocked the basketball community by announcing his retirement, three months after his [[James R. Jordan, Sr.|father's murder]]. The Bulls were then led by [[Scottie Pippen]], who established himself as one of the top players in the league by winning the [[1994 NBA All-Star Game|1994 All-Star]] MVP. He received help from [[Horace Grant]] and [[B. J. Armstrong]], who were named to their first all-star games. The three were assisted by [[Bill Cartwright|Cartwright]], [[Will Perdue|Perdue]], shooting guard [[Pete Myers]], and [[Croats|Croatian]] rookie forward [[Toni Kuko\u010d]]. Despite the Bulls winning 55 games during the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]], they were beaten in seven games by the Knicks in the second round of [[1994 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], after a controversial foul call by referee [[Hue Hollins]] in game 5 of that series. The Knicks eventually reached the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] that year, but lost to the [[Houston Rockets]]. The Bulls opened the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]] by leaving their home of 27 years, [[Chicago Stadium]], and moving into their current home, the [[United Center]].\n\nIn 1994, the Bulls lost Grant, Cartwright and [[Scott Williams (basketball)|Scott Williams]] to free agency, and [[John Paxson]] to retirement, but picked up shooting guard [[Ron Harper]], the seeming heir apparent to Jordan in assistant coach [[Tex Winter]]'s triple-post offense, and small-forward [[Jud Buechler]]. The Bulls started Armstrong and Harper in the backcourt, Pippen and Kuko\u010d at the forward spots, and Perdue at center. They also had sharpshooter [[Steve Kerr]], whom they acquired via free agency before the 1993\u201394 season, Myers, and centers [[Luc Longley]] (acquired via trade in 1994 from the Minnesota Timberwolves) and [[Bill Wennington]]. However, the Bulls struggled during the season, and on March 18, 1995, they received the news that Michael Jordan was coming out of retirement. He scored 55 points against the Knicks in only his fifth game back, and led the Bulls to the fifth seed in [[1995 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they defeated the Charlotte Hornets. However, Jordan and the Bulls were unable to overcome the eventual Eastern Conference champion [[Orlando Magic]], which included [[Horace Grant]], [[Penny Hardaway]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]].\n\nIn the off-season, the Bulls lost Armstrong in the expansion draft, and Krause traded Perdue to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for rebounding specialist [[Dennis Rodman]], who had won the past four rebounding titles, and who had also been a member of the [[Detroit Pistons]]' \"Bad Boys\" squad that served as the Bulls' chief nemesis in the late 1980s.\n\n===1995\u20131998: Return of Michael Jordan and second championship three-peat===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width =\n| image1 = Jordan Lipofsky.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| caption1 = [[Michael Jordan]]\n| image2 = Lipofsky Pippen.jpg\n| width2 = 151\n| caption2 = [[Scottie Pippen]]\n| image3 = \n| width3 = 130\n| caption3 = [[Dennis Rodman]]\n}}\nWith a lineup of Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, Harper and Longley, and perhaps the league's best bench in [[Steve Kerr]], Kuko\u010d, Wennington, Buechler, and guard [[Randy Brown (basketball)|Randy Brown]], the Bulls were seen as the team to win again for the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Bulls started their 1995\u201396 campaign with a 105\u201391 win over the visiting Hornets.

Scottie Pippen was looking for a significant contract extension that he thought he deserved, but was not getting from the organization. In spite of the turmoil that surrounded the Bulls, they still had a remarkable season, with a final regular-season record of 62\u201320. Jordan would be named the league MVP for the fifth and final time, and the Bulls went into the playoffs as the number one seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe first round of the playoffs for the Bulls was against the [[New Jersey Nets]], a team led by [[Keith Van Horn]], [[Kendall Gill]] and [[Sam Cassell]]. The Bulls swept the Nets three to nothing in a best of five series. The conference semi-finals were more challenging with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] stealing game two from the Bulls at the United Center, and tying the series 1\u20131. But the Bulls easily defeated the Hornets in the next three games of the series. The Conference Finals was a challenge for the Bulls as they went up against the [[Reggie Miller]]-led [[Indiana Pacers]]. Experts were of the opinion that the Pacers had the best chance to defeat the Bulls.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The Pacers gave the Bulls no road wins, winning games 3, 4, and 6, sending the series to a deciding game seven at the United Center. The Bulls prevailed and beat the Pacers 88\u201383, winning their 6th Eastern Conference Championship.\n\nIn a much-anticipated Finals, The Bulls faced the team they beat the previous year, the [[Utah Jazz]]. Led by [[Karl Malone]] and [[John Stockton]], the Jazz felt confident that they could defeat the Bulls, winning game one at Utah's [[Vivint Smart Home Arena|Delta Center]]. Facing a potential two to nothing deficit, the Bulls won Game 2 at the Delta Center and tied the series. The Bulls returned to the United Center and, by winning the next two games, took a 3\u20131 series lead. The Jazz won Game 5 by two points, 83\u201381. Game 6 was a tough battle for both teams. Scottie Pippen left early in the 1st quarter due to an ongoing back injury. He came back at the start of the 2nd half, and after a trip or two to the locker room to get physical therapy, came back out to finish the game.  Late in the game and down by three points to the Jazz, Michael Jordan led the Bulls to one final win. Jordan hit a shot to bring the Bulls within 1, then stole the ball from Karl Malone and hit [[The Last Shot (basketball)|the game winning shot]] with 5.2 seconds remaining on the clock. With a score of 87\u201386, John Stockton put up a three-pointer, but missed, giving the Bulls their sixth championship in eight years. Jordan would be named the Finals MVP for the sixth time in his career. He retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.\n\n===1998\u20132008: Post-Jordan era and a decade of struggle===\n====1998\u20132004: Post-dynasty struggles====\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Summarize section|date=February 2022}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2022}}\n}}\nThe summer of 1998 brought an abrupt end to the championship era.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/schedule/results_1998.html |title=Bulls Schedule 1998\u201399 |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |website=Bulls.com |access-date=August 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912081927/http://www.nba.com/bulls/schedule/results_1998.html|archive-date=September 12, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Krause felt that the Bulls were on the verge of being too old and unable to compete. He decided that the team's only choices were to rebuild or endure a slow decline. His plan was to trade away the aging talent and acquire high draft picks while clearing salary cap space to make a run at several promising free agents in two years' time. After having been vetoed in a previous attempt by owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]], Krause traded [[Scottie Pippen]] for [[Roy Rogers (basketball)|Roy Rogers]] (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. He also decided not to re-sign [[Dennis Rodman]], and traded [[Luc Longley]] and [[Steve Kerr]] for other draft picks. He hired a new coach, [[Tim Floyd]], who had run a successful program at [[Iowa State University]]. Upon Phil Jackson's departure, Michael Jordan made his second retirement official. With a new starting lineup of point guard Randy Brown, shooting guard [[Ron Harper]], newcomer [[Brent Barry]] at small forward, power forward [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], and center Bill Wennington, the team began the [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]]-shortened [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]]. Kuko\u010d led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists, but the team won only 13 of 50 games. The lowest point of the season came on April 10 in a game against the Miami Heat. In that game, the Bulls scored 49 points to set an NBA record for the fewest points in a game in the shot-clock era.\n\nThe previous year's dismal finish came with one highlight: the team won the draft lottery and the rights to power forward [[Elton Brand]]. Since the team lost Harper, Wennington and Barry in the off-season, Brand and fellow rookie [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]] led the team throughout the year, especially after Kuko\u010d missed most of the season due to injury and was then dealt for a draft pick at the trading deadline. Brand recorded the first 20\u201310 average for the Bulls since the days of [[Artis Gilmore]]. He led all rookies in scoring, [[Rebound (sports)|rebounds]], blocks, field goal percentage and minutes, while Artest led all rookies in steals and finished second on the team in scoring. For his efforts Brand was named [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000]] co-[[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] with [[Houston Rockets|Houston]]'s [[Steve Francis]], and to the all-rookie first team, while Artest was named to the all-rookie second team. However, the team established a franchise low at 17\u201365, second-worst in the league.\n\nAfter a summer in which the Bulls witnessed most major and minor free agents [[Tim Duncan]], [[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant Hill]], [[Tracy McGrady]], [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and even [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] choose to stay with their teams (or go elsewhere) rather than sign with them, Krause signed free agent center [[Brad Miller (basketball player)|Brad Miller]] and shooting guard [[Ron Mercer]], and drafted power forward [[Marcus Fizer]] and traded draft pick Chris Mihm to Cleveland for the rights of guard [[Jamal Crawford]]. Brand again led the team in scoring and rebounds with another 20\u201310 season, but the new acquisitions failed to make a major impact, and they finished with the worst record in team history and the league's worst for the season at 15\u201367.\n\nKrause shocked Bulls fans on [[2001 NBA draft|draft day in 2001]] when he traded franchise player Brand to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] for the second pick in the draft, [[Tyson Chandler]]. He also selected [[Eddy Curry]] with the fourth pick. Since both Chandler and Curry came straight out of high school, neither was expected to make much of a contribution for several years, but they were seen as potential franchise players. The team floundered without veteran leadership. At mid-season, the Bulls traded their top three scorers\u2014Mercer, [[Metta World Peace|Artest]], and [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Miller]] along with Kevin Ollie\u2014to the [[Indiana Pacers]] for veteran guard [[Jalen Rose]], [[Travis Best]] and Norman Richardson. There was also a change in coaching, with Floyd being dismissed in favor of assistant coach and former Bulls co-captain Bill Cartwright, following a series of arguments with players and management. The Bulls improved from 15 to 21 wins, although they were still tied for last in the league.\n\nFor the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]], the Bulls came to play with much optimism. They picked up college phenom [[Jay Williams (basketball)|Jay Williams]] with the second pick in [[2002 NBA draft|the draft]]. Williams teamed with Jalen Rose, Crawford, Fizer, newcomer [[Donyell Marshall]], Curry, Chandler, and guard [[Trenton Hassell]] to form a young and exciting nucleus which improved to 30\u201352 in Bill Cartwright's first full season as [[head coach]]. Curry led the league in field goal percentage, becoming the first Bull since Jordan to lead the league in a major statistical category.\n\nDuring the summer of 2003, long-time GM [[Jerry Krause]] retired, and former player and color commentator John Paxson was tapped as his successor. Jay Williams, coming off a promising rookie campaign, was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. His contract was bought out by the Bulls in February 2004, and he never returned to the league. Paxson selected point guard [[Kirk Hinrich]] with the seventh pick in the draft, and signed veteran free agent and former franchise player Scottie Pippen. With Pippen playing, Cartwright at the sidelines, and Paxson in the [[Front office (sports)|front office]], the Bulls hoped that some of the championship magic from before would return.\n\nHowever, the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]] was a resounding disappointment. Eddy Curry regressed, leading to questions about his conditioning and commitment. Tyson Chandler was plagued by a chronic back injury, missing more than thirty games. Pippen's ability to influence games was impaired by knee problems, and he openly contemplated retirement. Jamal Crawford remained inconsistent. Bill Cartwright was fired as head coach in December and replaced with former Phoenix coach [[Scott Skiles]]. A trade with the [[Toronto Raptors]] brought [[Antonio Davis]] and Jerome Williams in exchange for Rose and Marshall in what was seen as a major shift in team strategy from winning with athleticism to winning with hard work and defense. After struggling throughout the season, the Bulls finished with 23 wins and 59 losses, the second-worst record in the league. Fizer was not re-signed, and Crawford was re-signed and traded to the Knicks for expiring contracts. Hinrich provided the lone bright spot, becoming a fan favorite for his gritty determination and tenacious defense. He won a place on the All-Rookie first team.\n\n====2004\u20132007: Resurgence====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2022}}\n[[File:Luol Deng Wizards.jpg|thumb|left|[[Luol Deng]] made his first All-Star appearance with the team in 2012 and his second in 2013.]]\nDuring the 2004 off-season, Paxson traded a [[2005 NBA draft|2005 draft pick]] to the [[Phoenix Suns]] in return for an additional pick in the [[2004 NBA draft]]. He used the picks to select [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]] guard [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] and [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] small forward [[Luol Deng]] in the first round, and Duke point guard [[Chris Duhon]] in the second. Paxson also signed free agent small forward [[Andr\u00e9s Nocioni]], who had recently won an [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] gold medal as a member of the [[Argentina national basketball team]]. After losing the first nine games of the season, the Bulls began to show signs of improvement behind their improved team defense and clutch fourth-quarter play from Gordon. The Bulls, who were 0\u20139 to start the season, finished the regular season 47\u201335, with the third-best record in the Eastern Conference and advanced to the [[2004 NBA playoffs|NBA playoffs]] for the first time since Jordan's departure. In the first round, the 4th-seeded Bulls played the Washington Wizards. Despite an injury to Deng and a heart issue with Curry, the Bulls opened the series with two wins at home, but lost the next four games and the series. After the season, Ben Gordon became the first rookie to win the [[NBA Sixth Man Award]] and the first Bull since Kuko\u010d in 1996 to win the award.\n\nDuring the 2005 off-season, the Bulls re-signed free agent [[Tyson Chandler]]. However, Curry showed possible symptoms of a heart disease resulting of a heart murmur during checkups, and Paxson would not clear him to play without extensive [[DNA]] testing. Ultimately, Curry refused to participate in the tests, and he was traded along with Antonio Davis to the [[New York Knicks]] for [[Michael Sweetney]], [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]], and what became the second pick of the [[2006 NBA draft]]\u2014as well as the right to swap picks with New York in the [[2007 NBA draft]].\n\nWithout a significant post presence, the Bulls struggled for most of the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]]. However, a late-season 12\u20132 surge allowed them to finish 41\u201341 and qualify for the [[2006 NBA playoffs|2006 playoffs]] as the seventh seed. There, the Bulls faced the [[Miami Heat]]. After two close losses in Miami, the Bulls broke through with a blowout win in Game 3, and another win in Game 4. However, the Heat took the next two games to win the series and went on to win that year's championship. The Bulls' several young players nevertheless earned additional postseason experience, and Nocioni turned in a remarkable series of performances that far exceeded his season averages.\n\nIn the 2006 NBA Draft, the Bulls were awarded forward-center [[LaMarcus Aldridge]] and immediately traded him to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] for forward [[Tyrus Thomas]] and forward [[Viktor Khryapa]]. In a second draft-day trade, the Bulls selected [[Rodney Carney]] and traded him to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] for guard [[Thabo Sefolosha]]. Later that summer, four-time Defensive Player of the Year [[Ben Wallace (basketball)|Ben Wallace]] signed with the Bulls for a reported four-year, $60&nbsp;million contract. Following the signing of Wallace, the Bulls traded [[Tyson Chandler]], the last remaining player of the Krause era, to the (then) [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Hornets|New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets]] for veteran power forward [[P.J. Brown]] and [[J. R. Smith]] and salary cap space that was used to sign former Chicago co-captain [[Adrian Griffin]].\n\nIn 2006\u201307, the Bulls overcame a 3\u20139 season start to finish 49\u201333, the third-best record in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]]. In the first round, the Bulls again faced [[Miami Heat|Miami]], the defending NBA champions. The Bulls narrowly won Game 1 at home, then followed it with a blowout victory in Game 2. In Miami, the Bulls rallied from a 12-point second-half deficit to win Game 3 and then posted another comeback win in Game 4. The Bulls' four-game sweep of the defending champions stunned many NBA observers. It was Chicago's first playoff series victory since 1998, Jordan's last season with the team.\n\nThe Bulls then advanced to face the [[Detroit Pistons]], marking the first time the [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]] rivals had met in the playoffs since 1991. The Pistons won the first three games including a big comeback in Game 3. No NBA team had ever come back from a 0\u20133 deficit to win the series, but the Bulls avoided a sweep by winning Game 4 by 10 points. The Bulls then easily won Game 5 in Detroit, and had a chance to make NBA history. But they lost at home in game 6 by 10, and the Pistons won the series 4\u20132 on May 17.\n\n====2007\u20132008: Missing the playoffs====\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2022}}\n{{Summarize section|date=February 2022}}\n}}\n[[File:Joakim Noah 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joakim Noah]] was drafted by the Bulls in 2007.

Then rumors surfaced that the Bulls were pursuing stars like [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Pau Gasol]], and most notably, [[Kobe Bryant]]. None of these deals happened, and general manager [[John Paxson]] denied a deal was ever imminent.\n\nThe Bulls started the [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2007\u201308 season]] by losing 10 of their first 12 games and on December 24, 2007, after a 9\u201316 start, the Bulls fired head coach [[Scott Skiles]]. [[Jim Boylan]] was named the interim head coach on December 27, 2007.\n\nOn February 21, 2008, [[Ben Wallace (basketball)|Ben Wallace]], [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]], [[Adrian Griffin]] and the Bulls' 2009 2nd-round draft pick were exchanged for [[Drew Gooden]], [[Cedric Simmons]], [[Larry Hughes]] and [[Shannon Brown]] in a three-team trade deal involving the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/transactions/current_month_transactions.html |title=NBA.com: February 2008 Transactions |website=[[NBA.com]] |access-date=February 21, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018110518/http://www.nba.com/transactions/current_month_transactions.html |archive-date=October 18, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Boylan was not retained on April 17 at the conclusion of the 2007\u201308 season after compiling a 24\u201332 record with the Bulls. The Bulls ended the 2007\u201308 campaign with a 33\u201349 record, a complete reversal of last year's record.\n\nAfter [[Jim Boylan]]'s interim tenure expired, the Bulls began the process of selecting a new head coach. They were in talks with former [[Phoenix Suns|Phoenix]] head coach [[Mike D'Antoni]], but on May 10, 2008, he signed with the [[New York Knicks]]. Other possible options included former [[Dallas Mavericks|Dallas]] head coach [[Avery Johnson]] and former Bulls head coach [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]]. Collins resigned from the coaching list on June 4, 2008, reporting that he did not want to ruin his friendship with [[Jerry Reinsdorf]].\n\nOn June 10, 2008, the Bulls general manager [[John Paxson]] hired [[Vinny Del Negro]], with no coaching experience, to coach the young Bulls. On July 3, 2008, the ''Chicago Tribune'' reported that Del Harris agreed to become an assistant coach for the Bulls along with former [[Charlotte Bobcats]] head coach [[Bernie Bickerstaff]] and longtime NBA assistant coach Bob Ociepka. Along with Bickerstaff and Ociepka, Harris helped establish a veteran presence on the coaching staff and helped rookie head coach Del Negro.\n\n===2008\u20132016: Derrick Rose era===\n====2008\u20132010: Appearance of Derrick Rose====\nWith a slim 1.7% chance of winning the rights to draft number 1, the Bulls won the 2008 [[NBA draft lottery]] and selected first overall.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=K.

On June 26, 2008, the Bulls drafted Chicago native [[Derrick Rose]] from the [[University of Memphis]] as the number 1 draft pick. At pick number 39 they selected [[Sonny Weems]]. The Bulls later traded Weems to the [[Denver Nuggets]] for Denver's 2009 regular second-round draft pick. The Bulls then acquired [[\u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k]] from the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] (selected with the 36th pick) for Denver's 2009 second-round draft pick, [[New York Knicks|New York]]'s 2009 second-round draft pick, and the Bulls' 2010 regular second-round draft pick.

Afterwards, the Bulls traded veteran point guard [[Kirk Hinrich]] to the [[Washington Wizards]] to create more cap space. The Bulls also signed former [[Philadelphia 76ers|76er]] and Jazz sharpshooter [[Kyle Korver]] to a three-year, $15&nbsp;million contract. The same day that the Bulls signed Kyle Korver, they signed Turkish All-Star [[\u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k]]. After being matched by the [[Orlando Magic]] for [[JJ Redick|J. J. Redick]], they signed their third free agent from the Jazz in the off-season in shooting guard [[Ronnie Brewer]], traded for former [[Golden State Warriors|Warrior]] point guard [[C.J. Watson]], and signed former [[Milwaukee Bucks|Bucks]] power forward [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]] as well as former [[San Antonio Spurs|Spurs]] player [[Keith Bogans]] and former Celtic [[Brian Scalabrine]].\n\nRose earned the 2011 NBA MVP Award, thereby becoming the youngest player in NBA history to win it. He became the first Bulls player since [[Michael Jordan]] to win the award. As a team, Chicago finished the regular season with a league-best 62\u201320 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time since 1998. The Bulls defeated the [[Indiana Pacers]] and the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in five and six games, respectively, thereby reaching the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 1998, and faced the [[Miami Heat]]. After winning the first game of the series, they lost the next four games, ending their season.\n\n====2011\u20132014: Injury-plagued seasons for Derrick Rose====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2022}}\nDuring the off-season, the Bulls drafted [[Jimmy Butler]] 30th overall in the [[2011 NBA draft]]. After the [[2011 NBA Lockout|NBA lockout]] ended, the Bulls lost Kurt Thomas to free agency, and released Keith Bogans. The Bulls signed veteran shooting guard [[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton]] to a three-year deal, after he was waived by the Detroit Pistons. The Bulls also gave MVP Derrick Rose a 5-year contract extension worth $94.8 million.\n\nDerrick Rose was voted as an NBA All-Star starter for the second consecutive year, and was the third leading voted player overall behind [[Dwight Howard]] and [[Kobe Bryant]]. Luol Deng was also selected as a reserve for the Eastern Conference. This was the first time that the Bulls had two all-stars since 1997, when Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen were the duo. Derrick Rose was injured for most of the [[2011\u201312 NBA season|2011\u201312 season]]; however, the team was still able to finish with a 50\u201316 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference for the second straight year and the best overall record in the NBA (tied with the [[San Antonio Spurs]]). Rose suffered a new injury when he tore his [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] during the 4th quarter of the first playoff game on April 28, 2012, against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and missed the rest of the series. Head coach [[Tom Thibodeau]] was criticized for keeping Rose in the game even though the Bulls were essentially minutes away from their victory over the 76ers. The Bulls lost the next three games, and also lost Noah to a foot injury after he severely rolled his ankle stepping on [[Andre Iguodala]]'s foot in Game 3; he briefly returned for part of the fourth quarter of that game, but missed the following games in the series. After winning Game 5 at home, the Bulls were eliminated by the 76ers in Game 6 in Philadelphia, becoming the fifth team in NBA history to be eliminated as a first seed by an eighth seed. In Game 6, Andre Iguodala sank two free throws with 2.2 seconds left to put the 76ers up 79\u201378 after getting fouled by [[\u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k]], who had missed two free throws five seconds earlier. At the end of the season, Boozer and A\u015f\u0131k were the only members on the Bulls' roster to have played in every game, with Korver and Brewer missing one game apiece. In the off-season, the Bulls gave up Lucas to the [[Toronto Raptors]], Brewer to the [[New York Knicks]], Korver to the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Watson to the [[Brooklyn Nets]] and A\u015f\u0131k to the [[Houston Rockets]], but brought back [[Kirk Hinrich]]. In addition, they added [[Marco Belinelli]], [[Vladimir Radmanovic]], [[Nazr Mohammed]] and [[Nate Robinson]] to the roster via free agency.\n\nRose missed the entire [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]], but despite his absence, the Bulls finished 45\u201337, second in the Central Division (behind the [[Indiana Pacers]]) and 5th in their conference. They defeated the [[Brooklyn Nets]] 4\u20133 (after leading 3\u20131) in the first round of the playoffs and lost to the [[Miami Heat]] 4\u20131 in the next round.\n\nDuring the season, the Bulls snapped both Miami's 27-game winning streak and the New York Knicks' 13-game winning streak, becoming the second team in NBA history to snap two winning streaks of 13 games or more in a season.\n\nJust 10 games into the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], Derrick Rose would tear his medial meniscus on a non-contact play. He declared he would miss the remainder of the season. On January 7, 2014, veteran forward [[Luol Deng]] was traded to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] for center [[Andrew Bynum]] and a set of picks. Bynum was immediately waived after the trade went through. The Bulls would finish second in the Central Division with 48 wins, and earned home-court advantage in the first round. Joakim Noah finished the season 4th in MVP voting, made All-NBA 1st team, and was awarded Defensive player of the year. However, due to lack of a strong offensive weapon,\nthey failed to win a single home game en route to losing to the [[Washington Wizards]] in five games.\n\nIn the [[2014 NBA draft]], the Bulls traded their 16th and 19th picks for [[Doug McDermott]], the former [[Creighton Bluejays men's basketball|Creighton]] star and 5th leading scorer in NCAA history, who was selected with the 11th pick, and in the second round, took [[Cameron Bairstow]] with the 49th pick. That off-season, they signed [[Pau Gasol]], re-signed [[Kirk Hinrich]] and brought over Eurostar [[Nikola Miroti\u0107]], who was acquired via a draft-day trade in 2011, but could not come over sooner, due to salary cap constraints.\n\n====2014\u20132015: Return of Derrick Rose to health and rise of Jimmy Butler====\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2022}}\nThe second return of [[Derrick Rose]] gave the Bulls and their fans optimism for the 2014\u201315 season. With 2-time NBA Champion [[Pau Gasol]] and a deep bench consisting of [[Taj Gibson]], [[Nikola Miroti\u0107]], [[Tony Snell (basketball)|Tony Snell]], [[Aaron Brooks (basketball)|Aaron Brooks]], [[Doug McDermott]], [[Kirk Hinrich]], among others, the Bulls were one of the two favorite teams to come out of the Eastern Conference along with the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. The Bulls started off the season in style with a blowout win of the [[New York Knicks]], and then winning 7 of their first 9 games (losses coming to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Boston Celtics]]). The emergence of [[Jimmy Butler]] as a primary scorer for the Bulls was a major surprise and he surged into the forefront of the \"[[NBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player of the Year]]\" award race. Butler's statistical jump was noted by many as one of the greatest in NBA History,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/chicago-bulls-jimmy-butler-wins-nba-most-improved-player-050715 |title=Chicago Bulls' Jimmy Butler Most Improved Players |date=May 7, 2015 |access-date=May 28, 2015 |work=ESPN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510001107/http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/chicago-bulls-jimmy-butler-wins-nba-most-improved-player-050715|archive-date=May 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> going from scoring just 13 points per game in 2013\u201314 to scoring 20 points per game in 2014\u201315. Pau Gasol was considered a huge asset for the Bulls and averaged a double-double throughout the season. Both Butler and Gasol ended up making the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The Bulls' second half of the season was marred by inconsistency and frustration set in with Derrick Rose blasting the team for not being on the same page. Tension between management and [[Tom Thibodeau]] continued to be a dark cloud hanging over the organization. The Bulls finished with a 50\u201332 record and the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference. They faced the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in the first round, and took advantage of the young and inexperienced Bucks by going up a quick 3\u20130 in the series. However, inconsistency and not being on the same page yet again plagued the Bulls as the Bucks won the next two games, sending a scare to Chicago. The Bulls bounced back with fury in Game 6 however, beating the Bucks by a playoff record 54 points winning the series 4\u20132. The next round saw the Bulls facing their arch-rival [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and their biggest nemesis, [[LeBron James]], who had beaten the Bulls in all three of their previous playoff meetings. The Bulls shocked the Cavs in Game 1 dominating them and never trailing. The Cavs answered back in Game 2 in the same fashion, never trailing the entire game. In a pivotal Game 3 in Chicago, the Bulls and Cavs battled closely all the way through, but the Bulls prevailed on a last-second buzzer-beating 3-pointer by [[Derrick Rose]]. In Game 4, the Cavaliers would answer once again, with [[LeBron James]] hitting the buzzer-beating shot to win the game. The Bulls lack of consistency and poor offensive showing doomed them once again as the Cavaliers won the next two games handily and closed out the series 4\u20132. After the series, speculation erupted about [[Tom Thibodeau]]'s job security due to escalating feud between Thibodeau and Bulls front office managers [[Gar Forman]] and [[John Paxson]].\n\n====2015\u20132016: Change in approach====\n[[File:Fred Hoiberg 2010 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fred Hoiberg]] was the 22nd head coach in the franchise's history.]]\nOn May 28, 2015, the Bulls fired Tom Thibodeau to seek a \"change in approach\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/chicago/nba/story/_/id/12968728/chicago-bulls-fire-tom-thibodeau-coach-five-seasons |title=Tom Thibodeau out in Chicago as Bulls seek 'change in approach' |first=Nick |last=Friedell |date=May 28, 2015 |access-date=May 28, 2015 |work=ESPN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528201141/http://espn.go.com/chicago/nba/story/_/id/12968728/chicago-bulls-fire-tom-thibodeau-coach-five-seasons|archive-date=May 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The Bulls named [[Fred Hoiberg]] as their head coach on June 2, 2015.<ref name=\"BullsHoiberg\">{{cite press release |title=Bulls Name Fred Hoiberg Head Coach |url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/release/bulls-name-hoiberg-head-coach |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |website=Bulls.com |date=June 2, 2015 |access-date=September 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925221511/http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/release/bulls-name-hoiberg-head-coach|archive-date=September 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The Bulls had only 1 draft pick in the [[2015 NBA draft]], and selected center [[Bobby Portis]] from the [[University of Arkansas]]. Bulls forward [[Mike Dunleavy Jr.]] was ruled out for at least the first four months of the season after completing back surgery. With Dunleavy out indefinitely, the Bulls promoted Doug McDermott to the starting lineup in his place at small forward. Before the season started, coach Fred Hoiberg made an incredibly controversial move by putting Nikola Miroti\u0107 as his starting power forward to pair with center Pau Gasol, meaning Joakim Noah, a long-time Bulls veteran and a fan-favorite was to come off the bench. Hoiberg told the media that the move was suggested by Noah himself but Noah denied having made any suggestions to Hoiberg, which sparked a distrust between the two before the season even began.\n\nThe Bulls started the 2015\u201316 season off well with an impressive season-opening 97\u201395 victory against archrivals and defending Eastern Conference Champion [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and jumped to an 8\u20133 record in the first month. The Bulls went 10\u20139 and through late November and December. The Bulls came back and won six straight games. However, soon afterwards, they lost 12 of their next 17 games and Butler missed four weeks after injuring his knee. The Bulls were eliminated from playoff contention after a loss to the Miami Heat on April 7, 2016, although finishing the season with a winning record of 42\u201340.

The teams have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA as an [[expansion team]] in 1970, but the rivalry didn't begin in earnest until the Bulls drafted [[Michael Jordan]] with the third overall pick in [[1984 NBA Draft|1984]]. After Jordan would go on to the [[Washington Wizards]] and eventually retire, the rivalry died down, but when Cleveland picked [[LeBron James]] with the first selection in [[2003 NBA Draft|2003]], the rivalry heated up again. However, the Cavaliers had an edge on the Bulls, who would pick [[Derrick Rose]] with the first selection in [[2008 NBA Draft|2008]] to turn Chicago from a lottery team, to a future contender.\n\n===Detroit Pistons===\n{{Further|Bulls\u2013Pistons rivalry}}\nThe Bulls' main division rivals have been the [[Detroit Pistons]] ever since the Jordan-led Bulls met the \"Bad Boy\" Pistons in the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nelson |first1=Murry R. |title=American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas [4 volumes]: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas |date=2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-39753-0 |page=647 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfTXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA647}}</ref> The two teams met in the playoffs four consecutive years, with the Pistons winning each time until 1991.

The geographic proximity and membership in the [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]] further intensify the rivalry, which has been characterized by intense, physical play ever since the teams met in the late 1980s. Chicago fans' rivalry with Detroit extends past the NBA, as the two cities shared divisions in all four major North American sports until 2013 when the [[Detroit Red Wings]] moved to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jimmy Butler, Dwyane Wade call out teammates after tough loss |url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/01/26/jimmy-butler-dwyane-wade-call-out-teammates-after-tough-loss |website=NBA.com |access-date=March 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331121747/http://www.nba.com/article/2017/01/26/jimmy-butler-dwyane-wade-call-out-teammates-after-tough-loss|archive-date=March 31, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Realignment plan approved by Board of Governors|url=https://www.nhl.com/redwings/news/realignment-plan-approved-by-board-of-governors/c-660140|access-date=2021-10-21|website=NHL.com|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Miami Heat===\nThe Bulls and the [[Miami Heat]] rivalry began once the Heat became contenders during the 1990s, a decade dominated by the Bulls. They were eliminated 3 times by Chicago, who went on to win the title each time. The rivalry was revived due to the return of the Bulls to the playoffs in the post-[[Michael Jordan]] era and the emergence of [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Derrick Rose]]. The revived rivalry was physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between players, most notably the actions of former Heat player [[James Posey]]. The Bulls and Heat met in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, with the Heat winning in 5 games. On March 27, 2013, Chicago snapped Miami's 27-game winning streak. The Bulls and Heat met later that year in the 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals. Miami won the series 4\u20131.\n\n===New York Knicks===\n{{Further|Bulls\u2013Knicks rivalry}}\nAnother franchise that the Bulls have competed fiercely with is the [[New York Knicks]]. The two teams met in the playoffs in four consecutive years (1991\u20131994) and again in 1996, with the teams' series twice (1992 and 1994) going the full seven games. Their first playoff confrontation, however, came in 1989 when both teams were called \"teams on the rise\" under [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Patrick Ewing]], respectively (rivalry that started their freshman year in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game]] with Jordan hitting the deciding jumper of the final). That first confrontation would belong to Chicago with six games of the Eastern Semifinals. The Bulls won in the first three years (1991\u20131993) before losing in 1994 but got revenge in 1996. As with Detroit, the historic rivalry between the cities has led to animosity between the teams and occasionally their fans.\n\n==Traditions==\n===Starting lineup introductions===\nDuring the Bulls' run of dominance, the player introductions became world-famous. Longtime announcer [[Tommy Edwards (announcer)|Tommy Edwards]] was the first to use [[Sirius (instrumental)|\"Sirius\"]],<ref name=WSJ>{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Ben |title=The One Record the Warriors Can't Take From the Bulls: Even as Golden State closes on a historic 73rd win, Chicago's pre-game music still sets the standard |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-one-record-the-warriors-cant-take-from-the-bulls-1460498500 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=April 12, 2016 |access-date=October 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008095800/https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-one-record-the-warriors-cant-take-from-the-bulls-1460498500|archive-date=October 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[On the Run (instrumental)|\"On The Run\"]] and other songs in game presentation in the NBA. When Edwards moved to Boston for employment with CBS Radio, he was replaced by [[Ray Clay]] in 1990, and Clay continued many of the traditional aspects of the Bulls introductions, including the music, [[The Alan Parsons Project]]'s \"Sirius\", for all six championship runs. The lights are first dimmed during the visiting team introduction, accompanied by \"[[The Imperial March]]\" from ''[[Star Wars]]'' composed by John Williams or \"On the Run\" by Pink Floyd, or \"Tick of the Clock\" by [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]]. Virtually all lights in the stadium are then shut off for the Bulls introduction, and a spotlight illuminates each player as he is introduced and runs onto the court; the spotlight is also focused on the Bulls logo prior to the introductions. Since the move to the United Center, lasers and fireworks have been added, and with improvements to the arena's White Way video screen, computer graphics on the stadium monitors have been added. These graphics feature the [[computer animation|3D-animated]] '[[Running of the Bulls]]' en route to the United Center, along the way smashing a bus featuring the opposing team's logo. Coincidentally, [[Alan Parsons]] wrote \"Sirius\" for his own band and was the sound engineer for \"On the Run\" from Pink Floyd's album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''.\n\nTraditionally, the players have been introduced in the following order: small forward, power forward, center, point guard, shooting guard. During the championship era, [[Scottie Pippen]] was usually the first (or second after [[Horace Grant]]) Bulls player introduced, and [[Michael Jordan]] the last. (Pippen and Jordan are the only players to play on all six Bulls championship teams.) More recently with [[Derrick Rose]]'s arrival, the guards have been reversed in order, making the Chicago-bred point guard the last player introduced. <!-- more history of the evolution of the starting introduction here --> Although internal disputes eventually led to the dismissal of Clay, the Bulls in 2006 announced the return of [[Tommy Edwards (announcer)|Tommy Edwards]] as the announcer.<ref>{{cite news|title=BULLS: Tommy Edwards|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/edwards_060912.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=September 12, 2006|access-date=August 1, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201152828/http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/edwards_060912.html|archive-date=December 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs part of Edwards' return, the introductions changed as a new introduction was developed by [[The Wachowskis|Lily and Lana Wachowski]], [[Ethan Stoller]] and Jamie Poindexter, all from Chicago. The introduction also included a newly composed remix of the traditional Sirius theme.\n\n===Black shoes and socks===\nThe Bulls have an unofficial tradition of wearing black shoes (regardless of being home or away) during the playoffs, which dates all the way back to [[1989 NBA playoffs|1989]] when they debuted the tradition.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ask Sam Smith: The Tribune's pro basketball reporter answers reader questions |url=http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/askthewriter/cs-070426asksamsmith,1,1025838.story?page=2&coll=cs-bulls-ask-headlines |access-date=September 9, 2007 |date=April 26, 2007 |publisher=ChicagoSports.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013113457/http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/askthewriter/cs-070426asksamsmith,1,1025838.story?page=2&coll=cs-bulls-ask-headlines |archive-date=October 13, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Then-Bulls backup center [[Brad Sellers]] suggested to wear black shoes as a way to show unity within the team. For the 1996 playoffs, they became the first team to wear black socks with the black shoes, similar to the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|University of Michigan]] and the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]] which started the trend in college earlier in the decade. Since then, many teams have this look in both the regular season and playoffs. It was noted when the Bulls made their first playoff appearance during the 2004\u201305 season after a six-year hiatus, they continued the tradition and wore black shoes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bulls Take Game 1 |url=http://chicago.comcastsportsnet.com/view_content_1p.asp?ID=8033 |access-date=September 9, 2007 |date=April 24, 2005 |publisher=ComcastSportsNet.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124525/http://chicago.comcastsportsnet.com/view_content_1p.asp?ID=8033 |archive-date=October 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEven though the Bulls generally wear black footwear in the playoffs since 1989, there have been some notable exceptions. In the [[1995 NBA playoffs|1995 playoffs]] against the Magic, when Michael Jordan debuted his [[Air Jordan#Product history|Air Jordan XI]] shoe, he wore the white colorway during the Bulls' playoff games in Orlando. He was fined by the Bulls for not complying with their colorway policy. During the [[2009 NBA playoffs|2009 playoffs]], the Bulls again broke the tradition when all of their players wore white shoes and socks in Game 3 of the first round against the Boston Celtics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tradition broken |url=http://www.blogabull.com/2009/4/24/851230/image-fanshot |access-date=April 24, 2009 |date=April 24, 2009 |publisher=ESPN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708014039/http://www.blogabull.com/2009/4/24/851230/image-fanshot |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> More recently, since the NBA's relaxation of sneaker color rules, some Bulls players wore either red or white sneakers in defiance of the tradition.\n\n===Circus trip===\nThe Bulls and their arena mates, the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], shared an odd tradition dating to the opening of Chicago Stadium. Every fall, [[Feld Entertainment]]'s now-defunct [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]] came to Chicago on its nationwide tour. Since it used large indoor venues rather than tents, it took over the United Center for its entire run and the Bulls were forced, along with the Blackhawks, to take an extended road trip that lasted about two weeks. Initially local newspapers and television and radio sportscasters, and later national programs like ''[[SportsCenter]]'', referred to this fortnight-long local hiatus as \"the circus trip\".<ref>K.C.

At one point, the Bulls also had an alternate logo during the early 1970s, featuring the same Bulls logo, but with a cloud that says \"Windy City\" below the bull's nose.\n\n===Uniforms===\n\n====1966\u20131973 uniforms====\nThe Bulls wear three different uniforms: a white uniform, a red uniform, and a black [[third jersey|alternate]] uniform. The original uniforms were esthetically close to the current design, featuring the iconic diamond surrounding the Bulls logo on the shorts and block lettering. What distinguished the original uniforms were the black drop shadows, red or white side stripes with black borders, and white lettering on the red uniforms. For the 1969\u201370 season, the red uniforms were tweaked to include the city name.<ref name=bullsuniforms>{{cite news |title=9 eye-catching Bulls jerseys over the years |url=http://history.bulls.com/9-eye-catching-bulls-jerseys-over-the-years/ |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |website=History.Bulls.com |date=December 16, 2015 |access-date=April 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043348/http://history.bulls.com/9-eye-catching-bulls-jerseys-over-the-years/|archive-date=April 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====1973\u20131985 uniforms====\nFor the 1973\u201374 season, the Bulls drastically changed their look, removing the side stripes and drop shadows while moving the front numbers to the left chest. While the white uniforms saw the \"Bulls\" wordmark go from a vertically arched to radially arched arrangement, the red uniforms saw a more significant makeover, featuring black lettering and a script \"Chicago\" wordmark. With a few tweaks in the lettering, these uniforms were used until 1985.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nThis uniform set was later revived as a throwback uniform during the 2003\u201304 and 2015\u201316 seasons.\n\n====1985\u2013present uniforms====\nStarting with the 1985\u201386 season, the Bulls updated their uniform. Among the more notable changes in the look were centered uniform numbers and a vertically arched \"Bulls\" wordmark in both the red and white uniforms. Like the previous set, this uniform saw a few tweaks particularly in the treatment of the player's name.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nWhen [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, the Bulls kept much of the same look save for the truncated shoulder striping and the addition of the [[Flag of Chicago|Chicago four stars]] on the waistline. With Nike and the NBA eliminating designations on home and away uniforms, the Bulls also announced that their red \"Icon\" uniforms would become their home uniforms, and the white \"Association\" uniforms would become their away uniforms.<ref>{{cite news |title=LOOK: Chicago Bulls unveil revamped Nike jerseys, opt to wear red for home games |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-chicago-bulls-unveil-revamped-nike-jerseys-opt-to-wear-red-for-home-games/ |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=August 2, 2017 |access-date=November 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032126/https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-chicago-bulls-unveil-revamped-nike-jerseys-opt-to-wear-red-for-home-games/|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Bulls would continue to wear red \"Icon\" uniforms in home games until the 2020\u201321 season, after which they returned to wearing the white \"Association\" uniforms in home games starting in the 2021\u201322 season.<ref name=BullsHomeWhite>{{cite news |title=It's official, Bulls will wear white jerseys at home |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/bulls-will-wear-white-uniforms-home-team-announces|publisher=NBCSports.com |date=October 7, 2021 |access-date=October 7, 2021}}</ref>\n\n====Alternate black uniforms====\nIn the 1995\u201396 season, the Bulls added a black uniform to their set. The initial look featured red pinstripes and lacked the classic diamond on the shorts. This set was revived as throwback uniforms in the 2012\u201313 seasons.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nFrom the 1997\u201398 to the 2005\u201306 seasons, the Bulls wore slightly modified black uniforms without pinstripes. This set, with a few slight changes in the template, also marked the return of the city name in front of the uniform during the 1999\u20132000 season.\n\nThe 2006\u201307 season saw another change in the Bulls' black alternate uniform, now resembling the red and white uniform with the addition of a red diamond in the shorts. For the 2014\u201315 season, the uniforms were tweaked a bit to include sleeves and a modernized diamond treatment in black with red and white borders.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nSince the 2017\u201318 season, the Bulls' black uniforms remained mostly untouched save for the aforementioned switch to the new Nike logo that affected the treatment towards the shoulder piping. Nike also dubbed this uniform as the \"Statement\" uniform in reference to its third jerseys. The Bulls began wearing the Statement uniforms after Thanksgiving and they are currently used in away games against teams that wear their white, gray/silver or cream uniforms.\n\nThe 2019\u201320 season marked the return of pinstripes to the Bulls' \"Statement\" uniform, albeit in dark gray. In addition, the diamond treatment returned to red, piping was tweaked, and four six-point stars were featured on the beltline. The Bulls wore this \"Statement\" uniform in select home games and away games against teams wearing white, cream or silver uniforms.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chicago Bulls Introduce New Statement Edition Uniforms for 2019-20 Season |url=https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/chicago-bulls-introduce-new-statement-edition-uniforms-2019-20-season |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |website=Bulls.com |date=October 5, 2019 |access-date=October 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005234543/https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/chicago-bulls-introduce-new-statement-edition-uniforms-2019-20-season|archive-date=October 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=NBA Lockervision |url=https://lockervision.nba.com/ |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |access-date=October 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212205628/https://lockervision.nba.com/|archive-date=December 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Other uniforms====\nDuring the 2005\u201306 season, the Bulls honored the defunct [[Chicago Stags]] by wearing the team's red and blue throwback uniforms. The set featured red tops and blue shorts.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2017, the Bulls wore a green version of their red uniforms during the week of [[Saint Patrick's Day in the United States|St. Patrick's Day]] in March. The only red elements visible were those found on the team logo. For 2015 the Bulls wore sleeved versions of the green uniform that featured white lettering with gold and black trim and the \"Chicago\" wordmark replacing \"Bulls\" in front. In 2016 and 2017, they wore the same uniforms minus the sleeves.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2017, the Bulls wore a variation of their red uniforms as part of the NBA's \"Noche Latina\" festivities every March. The only notable change in this uniform was the \"Los Bulls\" wordmark in front. For 2014, the Bulls briefly retired the look in favor of a black sleeved uniform featuring \"Los Bulls\" in white with red trim.\n\nDuring the NBA's \"Green Week\" celebrations, the Bulls also wore green uniforms, but with a slightly darker shade from their St. Patrick's Day counterparts. They used their black alternate uniforms as its template. They donned the uniforms in a game against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] on April 9, 2009.\n\nThe Bulls also wore special edition Christmas uniforms as part of the [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|NBA's Christmas Day games]]. The one-off Christmas uniforms were as follows:\n* 2012: Monochrome red uniforms with lettering in red with black trim.\n* 2013: Sleeved red uniforms with Bulls logo rendered in silver.\n* 2014: Modified version of red uniform featuring the Bulls logo in front and a contrasting white nameplate of the player's first name. \n* 2015: Red uniforms with ornate script letters in cream.\n* 2016: Monochrome red uniforms with ornate script letters in black.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, the Bulls wore a gray \"Pride\" sleeved uniform, featuring the team name and other lettering in red with white trim. The shorts featured a more modernized version of the diamond, along with four six-pointed stars on either side.\n\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, the Bulls wore special \"City\" uniforms designed by Nike. The uniforms, designed to pay homage to Chicago's flag, are in white and feature the classic \"Chicago\" script and numbers in red with light blue trim along with four six-pointed stars on each side.\n\nThe Bulls' 2018\u201319 \"City\" uniform is once again inspired from Chicago's flag, with a black base and a portion of the flag with four red six-point stars and two powder blue stripes in front.\n\nThe Bulls' \"City\" uniform for 2019\u201320 continued the flag theme, featuring a light blue base and a recolored Bulls logo in front. The predominantly blue uniform was also inspired from the waters of [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[Chicago River]].\n\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Bulls' \"City\" uniform featured elements of Chicago's [[Art Deco]] architecture and imagery, featuring a dark grey base, gold lettering and red accents.\n\nThe Bulls' \"City\" uniform for the 2021\u201322 season was a \"mixtape\" of past uniform designs. The predominantly red uniform featured the following design cues:\n* Black and white striping, monochrome Bulls logo and white numbers with black drop shadows (1966\u201373 uniforms)\n* Cursive \"Chicago\" script, recolored to match the numbers (1973\u201385 uniforms)\n* Black diamonds with red pinstripes (1995\u201397 alternate uniforms)\n\nThe 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform paid homage to Chicago's [[Municipal device of Chicago|municipal device \"Y\" symbol]]. The predominantly white uniform featured rust red letters and black trim, as well as alternating red and black side stripes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chicago Bulls 22/23 City Edition Uniform: Ode to Architecture |url=https://www.nba.com/news/chicago-bulls-22-23-city-edition-uniform |website=NBA.com |access-date=November 11, 2022 |date=November 10, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Mascots==\n[[File:20180206 UM-NW Benny The Bull 7DM27126.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benny the Bull]] in February 2018]]\n{{See also|Benny the Bull}}\n[[Benny the Bull]] is the main mascot of the Chicago Bulls.

The Bulls also had another mascot named Da Bull. Introduced in 1995, he was described on the team website as being the high-flying cousin of Benny, known for his dunking skills. The man who portrayed Da Bull was arrested in 2004 for possession and selling marijuana from his car.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=ratto_ray&id=1715534 |title=The Mascots' stigmata |access-date=January 29, 2012 |work=ESPN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227124437/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=ratto_ray&id=1715534 |archive-date=December 27, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Da Bull was retired soon after the incident. While Benny has a family-friendly design, Da Bull was designed as a more realistic bull. Unlike Benny, Da Bull was brown. He also had a meaner facial expression and wore number 95.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n''List of the last five seasons completed by the Bulls.
