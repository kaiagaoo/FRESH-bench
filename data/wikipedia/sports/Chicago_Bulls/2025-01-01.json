They are known for having one of the NBA's greatest dynasties, winning six [[List of NBA champions|NBA championships]] between 1991 and 1998 with two [[three-peat]]s. All six of their championship teams were led by [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]rs [[Michael Jordan]], [[Scottie Pippen]], and coach [[Phil Jackson]]. The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships while never losing an [[NBA Finals]] series in their history.<ref>Jozsa, J. P.

The Bulls were the first team in NBA history to win 70 games or more in a single season, and the only NBA franchise to do so until the 2015\u201316 Warriors.<ref>{{cite news |title=Warriors Become Second Team in NBA History to Win 70 Games in a Single Season |url=http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/70-wins-20160407 |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |website=Warriors.com |date=April 7, 2016 |access-date=December 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223133724/http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/70-wins-20160407|archive-date=December 23, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince 1998, the Bulls have failed to regain their former success. The franchise struggled throughout the 2000s, but showed promise in the early 2010s led by [[Derrick Rose]] and [[Joakim Noah]], culminating in back-to-back seasons above .732 in [[2010\u201311 Chicago Bulls season|2010\u201311]] and [[2011\u201312 Chicago Bulls season|2011\u201312]]. An [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] tear suffered by Rose and subsequent trades of key players triggered a rebuild, culminating in the lineup built around [[NBA All-Star|All-Stars]] [[Zach LaVine]], [[DeMar DeRozan]] and [[Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107]]. \n\nJordan and Rose won the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] while playing for the Bulls, for a total of six MVP awards. The Bulls share rivalries with the [[Bulls\u2013Cavaliers rivalry|Cleveland Cavaliers]], [[Bulls\u2013Pistons rivalry|Detroit Pistons]], [[Miami Heat]], and the [[Bulls\u2013Knicks rivalry|New York Knicks]]. The Bulls' rivalry with the Pistons was highlighted heavily during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Outside of basketball, the Chicago Bulls are also known for their community work through their charity department, which provides youth and not-for-profit organizations with tickets to games and merchandise.\n\n==History==\n\n===1966\u20131975: Team creation and early success===\n[[File:Chicago bulls 1969-70 team.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|The 1969\u201370 Chicago Bulls]]\nThe Chicago Bulls were granted an NBA franchise on January 16, 1966, making them the third NBA team in Chicago's history, following the [[Chicago Stags]] (1946\u20131950) and the [[Chicago Packers|Chicago Packers/Zephyrs]] (1961\u20131963) {{NoteTag|The team eventually became the [[Washington Wizards]]}}. The franchise was founded by [[Dick Klein (basketball)|Dick Klein]], the only owner in Bulls history to have played professional basketball, having previously played for the [[Chicago American Gears]]. Klein served as the team\u2019s general manager and president during its formative years.\n\nAfter the [[1966 NBA Expansion Draft]], the Bulls (coached by Chicagoan and former NBA All-Star [[Red Kerr|Johnny \"Red\" Kerr]]) were allowed to acquire players from established teams. In their inaugural 1966\u201367 season, the Bulls played their first game on October 15, securing an upset victory over the [[St. Louis Hawks]].<ref name=\"Smith the one that started it all\">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Sam|url=https://www.nba.com/bulls/history/the-one-that-started-it-all|title=The one that started it all|website=[[NBA.com]]|date=October 15, 2015|accessdate=April 15, 2024}}</ref> They finished the season with a 33\u201348 record, the best by any expansion team in NBA history at the time, and became the first (and only) expansion team to qualify for the playoffs.<ref name=\"Smith the one that started it all\"/> Guard [[Guy Rodgers]], who led the league in assists, and forward [[Jerry Sloan]] were named All-Stars, and Kerr earned Coach of the Year honors.<ref name=\"Smith the one that started it all\"/>\n\nThe Bulls initially played their home games at the [[International Amphitheatre]] before moving to [[Chicago Stadium]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nba.com/bulls/features/rest-peace-don-kojis-original-bull |title=Rest In Peace To Don Kojis, The Original Bull |last=Smith |first=Sam |date=26 November 2021 |website=NBA.com |publisher= |access-date=18 November 2024 |quote=It became the most popular play for the modest number but excited fans in the South Side International Amphitheatre near the old Stockyards where the expansion Bulls played their games.

Williams revitalized the franchise, making key roster changes and introducing the team's first mascot, [[Benny the Bull]], which helped increase attendance and visibility.\n\nUnder Williams and head coach [[Dick Motta]], the Bulls made the playoffs for four consecutive seasons, including setting a franchise record of 57 wins in 1972. During this period, the team relied on key players like Sloan, [[Bob Love]], [[Chet Walker]], and [[Norm Van Lier]].<ref name=\"1960s Bulls\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nba.com/bulls/history/1960s-and-chicago-bulls |title=The 1960s and the Chicago Bulls |last= |first= |date=5 November 2015 |website=NBA.com |publisher= |access-date=18 November 2024 |quote=}}</ref><ref name=\"1970s Bulls\"/> The Bulls made their first appearance in the conference finals in 1975 but lost to the eventual NBA champions, the [[Golden State Warriors]], in a 4-3 series.\n\nDespite continued success through the early 1970s, the team faced challenges in the late decade. After four seasons of 50 or more wins, Williams left for Philadelphia, and Motta took on both the coaching and general manager roles. The Bulls' performance declined significantly, culminating in a 24\u201358 season in [[1975\u201376 Chicago Bulls season|1975\u201376]]. As a result, Motta was fired and replaced by [[Ed Badger]].\n\n===1976\u20131984: Gilmore and Theus duo===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2022}}\n[[File:Artis Gilmore 1977.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.79|Gilmore in 1977]]\nKlein sold the Bulls to the Wirtz family, longtime owners of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. Indifferent to NBA basketball, the new ownership group infamously implemented a shoestring budget, putting little time and investment into improving the team.\n\n[[Artis Gilmore]], acquired in the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] dispersal draft in 1976, led a Bulls squad which included guard [[Reggie Theus]], forward [[David Greenwood]] and forward [[Orlando Woolridge]].\n\nIn 1979, the Bulls lost a coin flip for the right to select first in the NBA draft ([[Rod Thorn]], the Bulls' general manager, called \"heads\"). Had the Bulls won the toss, they would have selected [[Magic Johnson]]; instead, they selected [[David Greenwood]] with the second pick. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] selected Johnson with the pick acquired from the [[New Orleans Jazz (NBA team)|New Orleans Jazz]], who traded the selection for [[Gail Goodrich]].\n\nAfter Gilmore was traded to the San Antonio Spurs for center [[Dave Corzine]], the Bulls employed a high-powered offense centered on Theus, and which soon included guards [[Quintin Dailey]] and [[Ennis Whatley]]. However, with continued dismal results, the Bulls decided to change direction, trading Theus to the [[Kansas City Kings]] during the [[1983\u201384 NBA season|1983\u201384 season]]. Attendance began to dwindle, with the Wirtz family looking to sell to ownership groups interested in moving the team out of Chicago, before selling to local ownership.\n\n===1984\u20131990: Michael Jordan era begins===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}\n[[File:Jordan by Lipofsky 16577.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Jordan]] was drafted third overall by the Bulls in [[1984 NBA draft|1984]]. He won six championships and six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]]s for Chicago.]]\nIn the summer of 1984, the Bulls had the third pick of the [[1984 NBA draft]], after Houston and Portland. The [[Houston Rockets|Rockets]] selected [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], the [[Portland Trail Blazers|Blazers]] picked [[Sam Bowie]] and the Bulls chose shooting guard [[Michael Jordan]]. The team, with new management in owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] and general manager [[Jerry Krause]], decided to rebuild around Jordan. Jordan set franchise records during his rookie campaign for scoring (third in the league) and steals (fourth), and led the Bulls back to [[1985 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they lost in four games to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. For his efforts, he was rewarded with a selection to the All-NBA Second Team and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nIn the following off-season, the team acquired point guard [[John Paxson]] and on draft day traded with the Cavaliers for the rights to power forward [[Charles Oakley]]. Along with Jordan and center [[Dave Corzine]], they provided much of the Bulls' offense for the next two years. After suffering a broken foot early in the [[1985\u201386 NBA season|1985\u201386 season]], Jordan finished second on the team to Woolridge in scoring. Jordan returned for [[1986 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], and led the eighth-place Bulls against the 67\u201315 [[Boston Celtics]], led by [[Larry Bird]]. At the time, the Bulls had the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.<ref>{{cite news |title=Worst Records of Playoff Teams |date=April 28, 1986 |newspaper=[[The Sporting News]] |page=46}}</ref> Though the Bulls were swept, Jordan recorded a playoff single-game record 63 points in Game 2 (which still stands to this day), prompting Bird to call him 'God disguised as Michael Jordan.'\n\nIn the [[1986\u201387 NBA season|1986\u201387 season]], Jordan continued his assault on the record books, leading the league in scoring with 37.1 points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First Team. The Bulls finished 40\u201342, which was good enough to qualify them for the playoffs. However, they were again swept by the Celtics in [[1987 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]].\n\nIn the [[1987 NBA draft|1987 draft]], to address their lack of depth, Krause selected center [[Olden Polynice]] eighth overall and power forward [[Horace Grant]] 10th overall, then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the fifth selection, [[small forward]] [[Scottie Pippen]]. With Paxson and Jordan in the backcourt, [[Brad Sellers]] and Oakley at the forward spots, Corzine anchoring center, and [[rookie]]s Pippen and Grant coming off the bench, the Bulls won 50 games and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals, where they were beaten by the eventual Eastern Conference Champions [[Detroit Pistons]] in five games. For his efforts, Jordan was named NBA [[Most Valuable Player]], an award he would win four more times over his career. The 1987\u201388 season would also mark the start of the Pistons-Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988 to 1991.\n\nThe [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988\u201389 season]] marked a second straight year of major off-season moves. Power forward [[Charles Oakley]], who had led the league in total rebounds in both 1987 and 1988, was traded on the eve of the [[1988 NBA draft]] to the [[New York Knicks]] along with a first-round draft pick used by the Knicks to select [[Rod Strickland]] for center [[Bill Cartwright]] and a first-round pick, which the Bulls used to obtain center [[Will Perdue]]. In addition, the Bulls acquired three-point shooter [[Craig Hodges]] from Phoenix. The new starting lineup of Paxson, Jordan, Pippen, Grant, and Cartwright took some time to mesh, winning fewer games than the previous season, but made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the NBA champion Pistons.\n\nIn [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]], Jordan led the league in scoring for the fourth straight season and was joined on the all-star squad for the first time by Pippen. There was also a major change during the off-season, where head coach [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] was replaced by assistant coach [[Phil Jackson]]. The Bulls also picked up rookie center [[Stacey King]] and rookie point guard [[B. J. Armstrong]] in the [[1989 NBA draft|1989 draft]]. With these additional players and the previous year's starting five, the Bulls again made it to the Conference Finals and pushed the Pistons to seven games before being eliminated for the third straight year, the Pistons going on to repeat as NBA champions.\n\n=== 1990\u20131993: First championship three-peat ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}\nIn the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]], the Bulls recorded a then-franchise record 61 wins, and romped through [[1991 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they swept the Knicks in the first round, defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the semifinals, and then swept the defending champion Pistons in the Conference Finals, then winning the [[1991 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] in five games over the [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nThe Bulls won their second straight title in {{nbafy|1992}} after racking up another franchise record for wins with 67. They swept the [[Miami Heat]] in the first round, defeated the Knicks in seven games in the second round, then the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in six games in the third round, advancing to the [[1992 NBA Finals|Finals]] for the second year in a row where they defeated the [[Clyde Drexler]]-led [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in six games.\n\nIn {{nbafy|1993}}, the Bulls won their third consecutive championship by defeating the [[Atlanta Hawks]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[New York Knicks]] in the first three rounds of the playoffs and then defeating regular season MVP [[Charles Barkley]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the Finals, with Paxson's three-pointer with 3.9 seconds left giving them a 99\u201398 victory in Game 6 in Phoenix.\n\n===1993\u20131995: Jordan's first retirement and the Scottie Pippen era===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2022}}\n[[File:United Center 060716.jpg|thumb|[[United Center]]]]\nOn October 6, 1993, [[Michael Jordan]] shocked the basketball community by announcing his retirement, three months after his [[James R. Jordan, Sr.|father's murder]]. The Bulls were then led by [[Scottie Pippen]], who established himself as one of the top players in the league by winning the [[1994 NBA All-Star Game|1994 All-Star]] MVP. He received help from [[Horace Grant]] and [[B. J. Armstrong]], who were named to their first all-star games. The three were assisted by [[Bill Cartwright|Cartwright]], [[Will Perdue|Perdue]], shooting guard [[Pete Myers]], and [[Croats|Croatian]] rookie forward [[Toni Kuko\u010d]]. Despite the Bulls winning 55 games during the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]], they were beaten in seven games by the Knicks in the second round of [[1994 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], after a controversial foul call by referee [[Hue Hollins]] in game 5 of that series. The Knicks eventually reached the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] that year, but lost to the [[Houston Rockets]]. The Bulls opened the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]] by leaving their home of 27 years, [[Chicago Stadium]], and moving into their current home, the [[United Center]].\n\nIn 1994, the Bulls lost Grant, Cartwright and [[Scott Williams (basketball)|Scott Williams]] to free agency, and [[John Paxson]] to retirement, but picked up shooting guard [[Ron Harper]], the seeming heir apparent to Jordan in assistant coach [[Tex Winter]]'s triple-post offense, and small-forward [[Jud Buechler]]. The Bulls started Armstrong and Harper in the backcourt, Pippen and Kuko\u010d at the forward spots, and Perdue at center. They also had sharpshooter [[Steve Kerr]], whom they acquired via free agency before the 1993\u201394 season, Myers, and centers [[Luc Longley]] (acquired via trade in 1994 from the Minnesota Timberwolves) and [[Bill Wennington]]. However, the Bulls struggled during the season, and on March 18, 1995, they received the news that Michael Jordan was coming out of retirement. He scored 55 points against the Knicks in only his fifth game back, and led the Bulls to the fifth seed in [[1995 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they defeated the Charlotte Hornets. However, Jordan and the Bulls were unable to overcome the eventual Eastern Conference champion [[Orlando Magic]], which included [[Horace Grant]], [[Penny Hardaway]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]].\n\nIn the off-season, the Bulls lost Armstrong in the expansion draft, and Krause traded Perdue to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for rebounding specialist [[Dennis Rodman]], who had won the past four rebounding titles, and who had also been a member of the [[Detroit Pistons]]' \"Bad Boys\" squad that served as the Bulls' chief nemesis in the late 1980s.\n\n===1995\u20131998: Return of Michael Jordan and second championship three-peat===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width =\n| image1 = Jordan Lipofsky.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| caption1 = [[Michael Jordan]]\n| image2 = Lipofsky Pippen.jpg\n| width2 = 151\n| caption2 = [[Scottie Pippen]]\n| image3 = \n| width3 = 130\n| caption3 = [[Dennis Rodman]]\n}}\nWith a lineup of Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, Harper and Longley, and perhaps the league's best bench in [[Steve Kerr]], Kuko\u010d, Wennington, Buechler, and guard [[Randy Brown (basketball)|Randy Brown]], the Bulls were seen as the team to win again for the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Bulls started their 1995\u201396 campaign with a 105\u201391 win over the visiting Hornets.

Scottie Pippen was looking for a significant contract extension that he thought he deserved, but was not getting from the organization. In spite of the turmoil that surrounded the Bulls, they still had a remarkable season, with a final regular season record of 62\u201320. Jordan would be named the league MVP for the fifth and final time, and the Bulls went into the playoffs as the number one seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe first round of the playoffs for the Bulls was against the [[New Jersey Nets]], a team led by [[Keith Van Horn]], [[Kendall Gill]] and [[Sam Cassell]]. The Bulls swept the Nets three to nothing in a best of five series. The conference semi-finals were more challenging with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] stealing game two from the Bulls at the United Center, and tying the series 1\u20131. But the Bulls easily defeated the Hornets in the next three games of the series. The Conference Finals was a challenge for the Bulls as they went up against the [[Reggie Miller]]-led [[Indiana Pacers]]. Experts were of the opinion that the Pacers had the best chance to defeat the Bulls.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The Pacers gave the Bulls no road wins, winning games 3, 4, and 6, sending the series to a deciding game seven at the United Center. The Bulls prevailed and beat the Pacers 88\u201383, winning their sixth Eastern Conference title.\n\nIn a much-anticipated Finals, The Bulls faced the team they beat the previous year, the [[Utah Jazz]]. Led by [[Karl Malone]] and [[John Stockton]], the Jazz felt confident that they could defeat the Bulls, winning game one at Utah's [[Delta Center]]. Facing a potential two to nothing deficit, the Bulls won Game 2 at the Delta Center and tied the series. The Bulls returned to the United Center and, by winning the next two games, took a 3\u20131 series lead. The Jazz won Game 5 by two points, 83\u201381. Game 6 was a tough battle for both teams. Scottie Pippen left early in the first quarter due to an ongoing back injury. He came back at the start of the second half, and after a trip or two to the locker room to get physical therapy, came back out to finish the game. Late in the game and down by three points to the Jazz, Michael Jordan led the Bulls to one final win. Jordan hit a shot to bring the Bulls within 1, then stole the ball from Karl Malone and hit [[The Last Shot (basketball)|the game winning shot]] with 5.2 seconds remaining on the clock. With a score of 87\u201386, John Stockton put up a three-pointer, but missed, giving the Bulls their sixth championship in eight years.

The Bulls initially shocked the Cavs in Game 1, but Cleveland responded strongly, winning the next three games, including a buzzer-beater by LeBron in Game 4. Despite a dramatic Game 3 win by Derrick Rose on a last-second three-pointer, the Bulls were ultimately defeated 4\u20132, ending their playoff run.

The teams have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA as an [[expansion team]] in 1970, but the rivalry didn't begin in earnest until the Bulls drafted [[Michael Jordan]] with the third overall pick in [[1984 NBA Draft|1984]]. After Jordan went on to the [[Washington Wizards]] and eventually retired, the rivalry died down, but when Cleveland picked [[LeBron James]] with the first selection in [[2003 NBA Draft|2003]], the rivalry heated up again. However, the Cavaliers had an edge over the Bulls, who would pick [[Derrick Rose]] with the first selection in [[2008 NBA Draft|2008]] to turn Chicago from a lottery team to a future contender.\n\n===Detroit Pistons===\n{{Further|Bulls\u2013Pistons rivalry}}\nThe Bulls' main division rivals have been the [[Detroit Pistons]] ever since the Jordan-led Bulls met the \"Bad Boy\" Pistons in the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nelson |first1=Murry R. |title=American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas [4 volumes]: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas |date=2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-39753-0 |page=647 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfTXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA647}}</ref> The two teams met in the playoffs four consecutive years, with the Pistons winning each time until 1991.

The geographic proximity and membership in the [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]] further intensify the rivalry, which has been characterized by intense, physical play ever since the teams met in the late 1980s. Chicago fans' rivalry with Detroit extends past the NBA, as the two cities shared divisions in all four major North American sports until 2013 when the [[Detroit Red Wings]] moved to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jimmy Butler, Dwyane Wade call out teammates after tough loss |url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/01/26/jimmy-butler-dwyane-wade-call-out-teammates-after-tough-loss |website=NBA.com |access-date=March 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331121747/http://www.nba.com/article/2017/01/26/jimmy-butler-dwyane-wade-call-out-teammates-after-tough-loss|archive-date=March 31, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Realignment plan approved by Board of Governors|url=https://www.nhl.com/redwings/news/realignment-plan-approved-by-board-of-governors/c-660140|access-date=October 21, 2021|website=NHL.com|archive-date=October 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211021213858/https://www.nhl.com/redwings/news/realignment-plan-approved-by-board-of-governors/c-660140|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Miami Heat===\nThe Bulls and the [[Miami Heat]] rivalry began once the Heat became contenders during the 1990s, a decade dominated by the Bulls. They were eliminated 3 times by Chicago, who went on to win the title each time. The rivalry was revived due to the return of the Bulls to the playoffs after the departure of Jordan from the Bulls and the emergence of [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Derrick Rose]]. The revived rivalry was physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between players, most notably the actions of former Heat player [[James Posey]]. The Bulls and Heat met in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, with the Heat winning in 5 games. On March 27, 2013, Chicago snapped Miami's 27-game winning streak. The Bulls and Heat met later that year in the 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals. Miami won the series 4\u20131. In 2023, the two would meet in the Eastern Conference play-in, with the Heat winning to advance to the playoffs. Notably the game featured former Bull, Jimmy Butler on the Heat and former teammates DeMar DeRozan (Chicago) versus Kyle Lowry (Miami).\n\n===New York Knicks===\n{{Further|Bulls\u2013Knicks rivalry}}\nAnother franchise that the Bulls have competed fiercely with is the [[New York Knicks]]. The two teams met in the playoffs in four consecutive years (1991\u20131994) and again in 1996, with the teams' series twice (1992 and 1994) going the full seven games. Their first playoff confrontation, however, came in 1989 when both teams were called \"teams on the rise\" under [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Patrick Ewing]], respectively (rivalry that started their freshman year in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game]] with Jordan hitting the deciding jumper of the final). That first confrontation would belong to Chicago with six games of the Eastern Semifinals. The Bulls won in the first three years (1991\u20131993) before losing in 1994 but got revenge in 1996. As with Detroit, the historic rivalry between the cities has led to animosity between the teams and occasionally their fans.\n\n==Traditions==\n\n===Starting lineup introductions===\nDuring the Bulls' run of dominance, the player introductions became world-famous. Longtime announcer [[Tommy Edwards (announcer)|Tommy Edwards]] was the first to use [[Sirius (instrumental)|\"Sirius\"]],<ref name=WSJ>{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Ben |title=The One Record the Warriors Can't Take From the Bulls: Even as Golden State closes on a historic 73rd win, Chicago's pre-game music still sets the standard |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-one-record-the-warriors-cant-take-from-the-bulls-1460498500 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=April 12, 2016 |access-date=October 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008095800/https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-one-record-the-warriors-cant-take-from-the-bulls-1460498500|archive-date=October 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[On the Run (instrumental)|\"On The Run\"]] and other songs in game presentation in the NBA. When Edwards moved to Boston for employment with CBS Radio, he was replaced by [[Ray Clay]] in 1990, and Clay continued many of the traditional aspects of the Bulls introductions, including the music, [[The Alan Parsons Project]]'s \"Sirius\", for all six championship runs. The lights are first dimmed during the visiting team introduction, accompanied by \"[[The Imperial March]]\" from ''[[Star Wars]]'' composed by John Williams or \"On the Run\" by Pink Floyd, or \"Tick of the Clock\" by [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]]. Virtually all lights in the stadium are then shut off for the Bulls introduction, and a spotlight illuminates each player as he is introduced and runs onto the court; the spotlight is also focused on the Bulls logo prior to the introductions. Since the move to the United Center, lasers and fireworks have been added, and with improvements to the arena's White Way video screen, computer graphics on the stadium monitors have been added. These graphics feature the [[computer animation|3D-animated]] '[[Running of the Bulls]]' en route to the United Center, along the way smashing a bus featuring the opposing team's logo. Coincidentally, [[Alan Parsons]] wrote \"Sirius\" for his own band and was the sound engineer for \"On the Run\" from Pink Floyd's album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''.\n\nTraditionally, the players have been introduced in the following order: small forward, power forward, center, point guard, shooting guard. During the championship era, [[Scottie Pippen]] was usually the first (or second after [[Horace Grant]]) Bulls player introduced, and [[Michael Jordan]] the last. (Pippen and Jordan are the only players to play on all six Bulls championship teams.) More recently with [[Derrick Rose]]'s arrival, the guards have been reversed in order, making the Chicago-bred point guard the last player introduced. <!-- more history of the evolution of the starting introduction here --> Although internal disputes eventually led to the dismissal of Clay, the Bulls in 2006 announced the return of [[Tommy Edwards (announcer)|Tommy Edwards]] as the announcer.<ref>{{cite news|title=BULLS: Tommy Edwards|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/edwards_060912.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures|website=Bulls.com|date=September 12, 2006|access-date=August 1, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201152828/http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/edwards_060912.html|archive-date=December 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs part of Edwards' return, the introductions changed as a new introduction was developed by [[The Wachowskis|Lily and Lana Wachowski]], [[Ethan Stoller]] and Jamie Poindexter, all from Chicago.

For the 1996 playoffs, they became the first team to wear black socks with the black shoes, similar to the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|University of Michigan]] and the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]] which started the trend in college earlier in the decade. Since then, many teams have this look in both the regular season and playoffs. It was noted when the Bulls made their first playoff appearance during the 2004\u201305 season after a six-year hiatus, they continued the tradition and wore black shoes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bulls Take Game 1 |url=http://chicago.comcastsportsnet.com/view_content_1p.asp?ID=8033 |access-date=September 9, 2007 |date=April 24, 2005 |publisher=ComcastSportsNet.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124525/http://chicago.comcastsportsnet.com/view_content_1p.asp?ID=8033 |archive-date=October 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEven though the Bulls generally wear black footwear in the playoffs since 1989, there have been some notable exceptions. In the [[1995 NBA playoffs|1995 playoffs]] against the Magic, when Michael Jordan debuted his [[Air Jordan#Product history|Air Jordan XI]] shoe, he wore the white colorway during the Bulls' playoff games in Orlando. He was fined by the Bulls for not complying with their colorway policy. During the [[2009 NBA playoffs|2009 playoffs]], the Bulls again broke the tradition when all of their players wore white shoes and socks in Game 3 of the first round against the Boston Celtics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tradition broken |url=http://www.blogabull.com/2009/4/24/851230/image-fanshot |access-date=April 24, 2009 |date=April 24, 2009 |publisher=ESPN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708014039/http://www.blogabull.com/2009/4/24/851230/image-fanshot |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> More recently, since the NBA's relaxation of sneaker color rules, some Bulls players wore either red or white sneakers in defiance of the tradition.\n\n===Circus trip===\nThe Bulls and their arena mates, the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], shared an odd tradition dating to the opening of Chicago Stadium. Every fall, [[Feld Entertainment]]'s now-defunct [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]] came to Chicago on its nationwide tour. Since it used large indoor venues rather than tents, it took over the United Center for its entire run and the Bulls were forced, along with the Blackhawks, to take an extended road trip that lasted about two weeks.

The original uniforms were esthetically close to the current design, featuring the iconic diamond surrounding the Bulls logo on the shorts and block lettering. What distinguished the original uniforms were the black drop shadows, red or white side stripes with black borders, and white lettering on the red uniforms. For the 1969\u201370 season, the red uniforms were tweaked to include the city name.<ref name=bullsuniforms>{{cite news |title=9 eye-catching Bulls jerseys over the years |url=http://history.bulls.com/9-eye-catching-bulls-jerseys-over-the-years/ |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |website=History.Bulls.com |date=December 16, 2015 |access-date=April 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043348/http://history.bulls.com/9-eye-catching-bulls-jerseys-over-the-years/|archive-date=April 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====1973\u20131985 uniforms====\nFor the 1973\u201374 season, the Bulls drastically changed their look, removing the side stripes and drop shadows while moving the front numbers to the left chest. While the white uniforms saw the \"Bulls\" wordmark go from a vertically arched to radially arched arrangement, the red uniforms saw a more significant makeover, featuring black lettering and a script \"Chicago\" wordmark. With a few tweaks in the lettering, these uniforms were used until 1985.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nThis uniform set was later revived as a throwback uniform during the 2003\u201304 and 2015\u201316 seasons.\n\n====1985\u2013present uniforms====\nStarting with the 1985\u201386 season, the Bulls updated their uniform. Among the more notable changes in the look were centered uniform numbers and a vertically arched \"Bulls\" wordmark in both the red and white uniforms. Like the previous set, this uniform saw a few tweaks particularly in the treatment of the player's name.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nWhen [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, the Bulls kept much of the same look save for the truncated shoulder striping and the addition of the [[Flag of Chicago|Chicago four stars]] on the waistline. With Nike and the NBA eliminating designations on home and away uniforms, the Bulls also announced that their red \"Icon\" uniforms would become their home uniforms, and the white \"Association\" uniforms would become their away uniforms.<ref>{{cite news |title=LOOK: Chicago Bulls unveil revamped Nike jerseys, opt to wear red for home games |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-chicago-bulls-unveil-revamped-nike-jerseys-opt-to-wear-red-for-home-games/ |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=August 2, 2017 |access-date=November 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032126/https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-chicago-bulls-unveil-revamped-nike-jerseys-opt-to-wear-red-for-home-games/|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Bulls would continue to wear red \"Icon\" uniforms in home games until the 2020\u201321 season, after which they returned to wearing the white \"Association\" uniforms in home games starting in the 2021\u201322 season.<ref name=BullsHomeWhite>{{cite news |title=It's official, Bulls will wear white jerseys at home |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/bulls-will-wear-white-uniforms-home-team-announces |publisher=NBCSports.com |date=October 7, 2021 |access-date=October 7, 2021 |archive-date=October 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211008001717/https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/bulls-will-wear-white-uniforms-home-team-announces |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Alternate black uniforms====\nIn the 1995\u201396 season, the Bulls added a black uniform to their set. The initial look featured red pinstripes and lacked the classic diamond on the shorts. This set was revived as throwback uniforms in the 2012\u201313 seasons.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nFrom the 1997\u201398 to the 2005\u201306 seasons, the Bulls wore slightly modified black uniforms without pinstripes. This set, with a few slight changes in the template, also marked the return of the city name in front of the uniform during the 1999\u20132000 season.\n\nThe 2006\u201307 season saw another change in the Bulls' black alternate uniform, now resembling the red and white uniform with the addition of a red diamond in the shorts. For the 2014\u201315 season, the uniforms were tweaked a bit to include sleeves and a modernized diamond treatment in black with red and white borders.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nSince the 2017\u201318 season, the Bulls' black uniforms remained mostly untouched for the aforementioned switch to the new Nike logo that affected the treatment towards the shoulder piping. Nike also dubbed this uniform as the \"Statement\" uniform in reference to its third jerseys. The Bulls began wearing the Statement uniforms after Thanksgiving and they are currently used in away games against teams that wear their white, gray/silver or cream uniforms.\n\nThe 2019\u201320 season marked the return of pinstripes to the Bulls' \"Statement\" uniform, albeit in dark gray. In addition, the diamond treatment returned to red, piping was tweaked, and four six-point stars were featured on the beltline. The Bulls wore this \"Statement\" uniform in select home games and away games against teams wearing white, cream, yellow, red or silver uniforms.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chicago Bulls Introduce New Statement Edition Uniforms for 2019-20 Season |url=https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/chicago-bulls-introduce-new-statement-edition-uniforms-2019-20-season |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |website=Bulls.com |date=October 5, 2019 |access-date=October 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005234543/https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/chicago-bulls-introduce-new-statement-edition-uniforms-2019-20-season|archive-date=October 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=NBA Lockervision |url=https://lockervision.nba.com/ |publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC |access-date=October 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212205628/https://lockervision.nba.com/|archive-date=December 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Other uniforms====\nThe Chicago Bulls have worn various special edition uniforms throughout the years to celebrate different events and milestones.\n* '''Throwback Uniforms:''' In the 2005\u201306 season, the Bulls honored the defunct Chicago Stags with red and blue throwback uniforms, featuring red tops and blue shorts.\n* '''St. Patrick's Day Uniforms:''' From 2006 to 2017, the Bulls wore green versions of their red uniforms around [[St. Patrick's Day]], with modifications such as sleeved versions in 2015 and a sleeveless style in 2016\u201317.\n* '''Noche Latina:''' Between 2009 and 2017, the Bulls wore a red variation of their uniforms for the NBA's \"Noche Latina,\" often featuring the \"Los Bulls\" wordmark.
