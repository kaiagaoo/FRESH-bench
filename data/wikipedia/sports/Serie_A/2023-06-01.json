From 1898 to 1922, the competition was organised into regional groups. Because of ever growing teams attending regional championships, the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC) split the CCI (Italian Football Confederation) in 1921, which founded in [[Milan]] the Lega Nord (Northern Football League), ancestor of present-day Lega Serie A. When CCI teams rejoined the FIGC created two interregional divisions renaming Categories into Divisions and splitting FIGC sections into two north\u2013south leagues. In 1926, due to internal crises and fascist pressures, the FIGC changed internal settings, adding southern teams to the national division, ultimately leading to the 1929\u201330 final settlement. Torino were declared champions in the [[1948\u201349 Serie A|1948\u201349 season]] following [[Superga air disaster|a plane crash]] near the end of the season in which the entire team was killed.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\nThe Serie A Championship title is often referred to as the ''scudetto'' (\"small shield\") because since the 1923\u201324 season, the winning team will bear a small coat of arms with the [[flag of Italy|Italian tricolour]] on their strip in the following season. The [[Football records in Italy#Most successful clubs overall (1898\u2013present)|most successful club]] is [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] with 36 championships, followed by [[Inter Milan]] and [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] with 19 championships. From the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305 season]] onwards, an actual trophy was awarded to club on the pitch after the last turn of the championship. The trophy, called the [[Coppa Campioni d'Italia]], has officially been used since the [[1960\u201361 Serie A|1960\u201361 season]], but between 1961 and 2004 was consigned to the winning clubs at the head office of the [[Lega Nazionale Professionisti]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\nIn April 2009, Serie A announced a split from Serie B. Nineteen of the twenty clubs voted in favour of the move in an argument over television rights; the relegation-threatened [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] had voted against the decision. Maurizio Beretta, the former head of Italy's employers' association, became president of the new league.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8027857.stm |title=Serie A to form breakaway league \u2013 BBC Sport |work=BBC News |date=2009-04-30 |access-date=2010-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/165281-serie-a-clubs-to-set-up-their-own-league |title=Serie A clubs to set up their own league |website=Bleacher Report |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141226012045/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/165281-serie-a-clubs-to-set-up-their-own-league |archive-date=2014-12-26 }}</ref><ref name=\"skysports\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11854_5260115,00.html |title=Serie A set for breakaway |publisher=SkySports |date=2009-04-30 |access-date=2010-10-03}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/30/serie-a-b-european-football-italy |title=Italian league splits in two after meeting ends in stalemate |newspaper=Guardian |date= 2009-04-30|access-date=2010-10-03 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, it was announced that Serie A was selected by the [[International Football Association Board]] to test video replays, which were initially private for the [[2016\u201317 Serie A|2016\u201317 season]], allowing them to become a live pilot phase, with replay assistance implemented in the [[2017\u201318 Serie A|2017\u201318 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/103940/serie-will-start-var|title=Serie A will start with VAR|publisher=Football Italia|date=10 June 2017|access-date=10 June 2017}}</ref> On the decision, FIGC President [[Carlo Tavecchio]] said, \"We were among the first supporters of using technology on the pitch and we believe we have everything required to offer our contribution to this important experiment.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/serie-selected-ifab-test-video-replay/|title=Serie A selected by IFAB to test video replay|publisher=sportsnet.ca|date=14 April 2016|access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nFor most of Serie A's history, there were 16 or 18 clubs competing at the top level. Since [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]], however, there have been 20 clubs in total. One season (1947\u201348) was played with 21 teams for political reasons, following post-war tensions with Yugoslavia. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league's history;\n* 18 clubs: 1929\u20131934\n* 16 clubs: 1934\u20131943\n* 20 clubs: 1946\u20131947\n* 21 clubs: 1947\u20131948\n* 20 clubs: 1948\u20131952\n* 18 clubs: 1952\u20131967\n* 16 clubs: 1967\u20131988\n* 18 clubs: 1988\u20132004\n* 20 clubs: 2004\u2013present\n\n[[File:Scudetto.svg|thumb|upright=0.65|''[[Scudetto]]'' patch]]\nDuring the season, which runs from August to May, each club plays each of the other teams twice; once at home and once away, totalling 38 games for each team by the end of the season. Thus, in Italian football a true [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format is used. In the first half of the season, called the ''andata'', each team plays once against each league opponent, for a total of 19 games. In the second half of the season, called the ''ritorno'', the teams play another 19 games, once more against each opponent, in which home and away matches are reversed. The two halves of the season had exactly the same order of fixtures until the [[2021\u201322 Serie A|2021\u201322 season]], when an asymmetrical calendar was introduced, following the format of the [[Premier League|English]], [[La Liga|Spanish]], and [[Ligue 1|French]] leagues.<ref name=asimmetrico>{{cite web |url=https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/serie-a/2021/07/02-83223629/rivoluzione_in_serie_a_il_calendario_sara_asimmetrico_cosa_cambia |title=Rivoluzione in Serie A: il calendario sar\u00e0 asimmetrico |work=[[Corriere dello Sport]] |date=2 July 2021 |language=it |access-date=18 July 2021}}</ref> Since the [[1994\u201395 Serie A|1994\u201395 season]], teams are awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss.

The three lowest-placed teams at the end of the season are [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] to [[Serie B]], and three Serie B teams are promoted to replace them for the next season.\n\n=== European qualification ===\nAs of 2022, Serie A is ranked as the fourth-best league by [[UEFA coefficient]], therefore the top four teams in the Serie A qualify straight to the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage. The team finishing fifth, along with the [[Coppa Italia]] winner (if the Coppa Italia winner finishes outside the top five) or the team finishing sixth (if the Coppa Italia winner finishes inside the top five), qualify for the [[UEFA Europa League]] group stage.

Prior to 2005\u201306, a play-off would immediately be used if teams were tied for first place, a European qualification spot, or a relegation spot. In some past years, the playoff was a single game at a neutral site while in others it was a two-legged tie decided by aggregate score. A playoff game has never been needed since the tiebreaking format changed.\n\nThe only time a playoff was used to decide the champion occurred in the [[1963\u201364 Serie A|1963\u201364 season]] when Bologna and Inter both finished on 54 points. Bologna won the playoff 2\u20130 at the [[Stadio Olimpico]] in Rome to win the scudetto.<ref name=\":0\" /> Playoff games were used on multiple occasions to decide European competition qualifications (most recently in [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|1999\u20132000]]) and relegation (most recently in [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]]).\n\n==Clubs==\n{{further|List of Italian Football Championship clubs}}\nBefore 1929, many clubs competed in the top level of Italian football as the earlier rounds were competed up to 1922 on a [[regional]] basis then interregional up to 1929.
