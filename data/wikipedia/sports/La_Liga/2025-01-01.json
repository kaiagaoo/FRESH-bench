Arenas, [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]], [[Athletic Bilbao]], [[Real Sociedad]] and [[Real Uni\u00f3n]] were all selected as previous winners of the {{Lang|es|[[Copa del Rey]]|italic=no}}. [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] and [[CE Europa|Europa]] qualified as {{Lang|es|Copa del Rey|italic=no}} runners-up and [[Racing de Santander]] qualified through a knockout competition. Only three of the founding clubs (Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Athletic Bilbao) have never been relegated from the ''Primera Divisi\u00f3n''.\n\n===1930s: Athletic Bilbao dominion===\n[[File:Athletic Club Copa 1933.png|thumb|Athletic Bilbao team in 1933.]]\nAlthough [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] won the first ''Liga'' in [[1929 La Liga|1929]] and [[Ricardo Zamora]]'s [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] won their first titles in [[1931\u201332 La Liga|1932]] and [[1932\u201333 La Liga|1933]], it was [[Athletic Bilbao]] that set the early pace winning La Liga in [[1929\u201330 La Liga|1930]], [[1930\u201331 La Liga|1931]], [[1933\u201334 La Liga|1934]] and [[1935\u201336 La Liga|1936]] (in addition to four [[Copa del Rey|Copa]] trophies), and they also achieved the biggest win in La Liga history by beating Barcelona 12-1; This team, coached by [[Fred Pentland]], is known by the nickname ''First historic squad'', notably forming an attacking partnership with [[Bata (footballer)|Bata]], [[Guillermo Gorostiza]], [[Jos\u00e9 Iraragorri]], [[Ignacio Agirrezabala|Chirri II]] and [[Lafuente (footballer, born 1907)|Lafuente]].

Seventy years later, on 28 September 2007, Barcelona requested the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] (Spanish acronym RFEF) to recognise that title as a ''Liga'' title. This action was taken after RFEF was asked to recognise [[Levante FC|Levante]]'s [[Copa de la Espa\u00f1a Libre]] win as equivalent to {{Lang|es|Copa del Rey|italic=no}} trophy.

Atl\u00e9tico were only awarded a place during the [[1939\u201340 La Liga|1939\u201340]] season as a replacement for [[Real Oviedo]], whose ground had been damaged during the war. The club subsequently won its first Liga title and retained it in [[1940\u201341 La Liga|1941]]. While other clubs lost players to exile, execution, and as casualties of the war, the Atl\u00e9tico team was reinforced by a merger. The young, pre-war squad of Valencia had also remained intact and in the post-war years matured into champions, gaining three Liga titles in [[1941\u201342 La Liga|1942]], [[1943\u201344 La Liga|1944]], and [[1946\u201347 La Liga|1947]]. They were also runners-up in [[1947\u201348 La Liga|1948]] and [[1948\u201349 La Liga|1949]].\n\n[[Athletic Bilbao]] was one of the clubs most affected by the war, since many of its players (sympathizers of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]]) went into exile in [[Latin America]] and very few returned. But thanks to a search for young talents, they managed to form the well-known ''Second historic squad'' made up of [[Rafael Iriondo]], [[Venancio P\u00e9rez]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Panizo]], [[Agust\u00edn Ga\u00ednza]] and the mythical scorer [[Telmo Zarra]] (Spanish [[List of La Liga top scorers|top scorer]] in La Liga history, among other records). They won a La Liga and Copa del General\u00edsimo double in [[1942-43 La Liga|1943]] and won the Cup again in [[1944 Copa del General\u00edsimo|1944]], [[1944\u201345 Copa del General\u00edsimo|1945]] and [[1949\u201350 Copa del General\u00edsimo|1950]], in addition to an [[Copa Eva Duarte]] (official predecessor of the [[Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a|Supercopa]]). [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] also enjoyed a brief golden era, finishing as runners-up in 1940 and 1942 before winning their only title to date in 1946.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of Spain, [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] began to emerge as a force under the legendary [[Josep Samitier]]. A Spanish footballer for both Barcelona and Real Madrid, Samitier cemented his legacy with Barcelona. During his playing career with Barcelona he scored 133 goals, won the inaugural La Liga title and five [[Copa del Rey|Copa Del Rey]]. In 1944, Samitier returned to Barcelona as a coach and guided them in winning their second La Liga title in [[1944\u201345 La Liga|1945]].
