After much debate about the size of the league and who would take part, the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|Real Federaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de F\u00fatbol]] eventually agreed on the ten teams who would form the first ''Primera Divisi\u00f3n'' in [[1929 La Liga|1929]]. [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Athletic Bilbao|Athletic Club]], [[Real Sociedad]], [[Arenas Club de Getxo|Getxo]], and [[Real Uni\u00f3n]] were all selected as previous winners of the [[Copa del Rey]]. [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]], and [[CE Europa|Europa]] qualified as Copa del Rey runners-up and [[Racing de Santander]] qualified through a knockout competition. Only three of the founding clubs (Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Athletic Club) have never been relegated from the ''Primera Divisi\u00f3n''.\n\n===1930s: Athletic Club prominence===\nAlthough [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] won the very first ''Liga'' in [[1929 La Liga|1929]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] won their first titles in [[1931\u201332 La Liga|1932]] and [[1932\u201333 La Liga|1933]], it was Athletic Club that set the early pace winning ''Primera Divisi\u00f3n'' in [[1929\u201330 La Liga|1930]], [[1930\u201331 La Liga|1931]], [[1933\u201334 La Liga|1934]] and [[1935\u201336 La Liga|1936]]. They were also runners-up in [[1931\u201332 La Liga|1932]] and [[1932\u201333 La Liga|1933]]. In [[1934\u201335 La Liga|1935]], [[Real Betis]], then known as ''Betis Balompi\u00e9'', won their only title to date. ''Primera Divisi\u00f3n'' was suspended during the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nIn 1937, the teams in the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] area of Spain, with the notable exception of the two [[Madrid]] clubs, competed in the [[Mediterranean League]] and Barcelona emerged as champions. Seventy years later, on 28 September 2007, Barcelona requested the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] (Spanish acronym RFEF) to recognise that title as a ''Liga'' title. This action was taken after RFEF was asked to recognise [[Levante FC]]'s [[Copa de la Espa\u00f1a Libre]] win as equivalent to Copa del Rey trophy. Nevertheless, the governing body of Spanish football has not made an outright decision yet.\n\n===1940s: Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia emerge===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n|+ Results of the five champions during the post-war years\n|-\n!

Atl\u00e9tico were only awarded a place during the [[1939\u201340 La Liga|1939\u201340]] season as a replacement for [[Real Oviedo]], whose ground had been damaged during the war. The club subsequently won its first Liga title and retained it in [[1940\u201341 La Liga|1941]]. While other clubs lost players to exile, execution, and as casualties of the war, the Atl\u00e9tico team was reinforced by a merger. The young, pre-war squad of Valencia had also remained intact and in the post-war years matured into champions, gaining three Liga titles in [[1941\u201342 La Liga|1942]], [[1943\u201344 La Liga|1944]], and [[1946\u201347 La Liga|1947]]. They were also runners-up in [[1947\u201348 La Liga|1948]] and [[1948\u201349 La Liga|1949]]. Sevilla also enjoyed a brief golden era, finishing as runners-up in 1940 and 1942 before winning their only title to date in 1946.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of Spain, [[FC Barcelona]] began to emerge as a force under the legendary [[Josep Samitier]]. A Spanish footballer for both Barcelona and Real Madrid, Samitier cemented his legacy with Barcelona. During his playing career with them, he scored 333 goals, won the inaugural La Liga title and five [[Copa del Rey|Copa Del Rey]]. In 1944, Samitier returned to Barcelona as a coach and guided them in winning their second La Liga title in [[1944\u201345 La Liga|1945]].

During the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, there were strict limits imposed on foreign players. Real Madrid continue to win until the 60s making it 12 titles in 15 years. In most cases, clubs could have only three foreign players in their squads, meaning that at least eight local players had to play in every game. During the 1950s, however, these rules were circumvented by Real Madrid who naturalized [[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]] and [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} Di St\u00e9fano, Pusk\u00e1s, [[Raymond Kopa]] and [[Francisco Gento]] formed the nucleus of the Real Madrid team that dominated the second half of the 1950s.

In 1956, [[Athletic Bilbao|Athletic Club]] won their sixth La Liga title, but Real Madrid won La Liga again in 1957 and 1958. In addition to their domestic success, Real Madrid dominated the newly created [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], sweeping the first five editions and assuming the title of the world's best football club. All in all, Barcelona and Real Madrid won 4 La Liga titles each in the 50s, with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid winning two Liga and Athletic Club winning one during this decade.\nAlthough [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], previously known as ''Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n'', were champions in 1950 and 1951 under ''[[catenaccio]]'' mastermind [[Helenio Herrera]], the 1950s continued the success [[FC Barcelona]] had during the late 1940s after they had won back to back La Liga titles. During this decade, Barcelona's first golden era emerged.

2021 |website=All Football}}</ref>\n\nPlayers can claim citizenship from the nation their ancestors came from. If a player does not have European ancestry, he can claim Spanish citizenship after playing in Spain for five years. Sometimes, this can lead to a triple-citizenship situation; for example, [[Leo Franco]], who was born in Argentina, is of Italian heritage yet can claim a Spanish passport, having played in La Liga for over five years.\n\nIn addition, players from the [[ACP countries]]\u2014countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the [[Cotonou Agreement]]\u2014are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the [[Kolpak ruling]].\n\n===Individual awards===\nUntil the 2008\u201309 season, no official individual awards existed in La Liga. In the 2008\u201309 season, the governing body created the [[La Liga Awards|LFP Awards]] (now called La Liga Awards), awarded each season to individual players and coaches. The majority of these awards were discontinued after the [[2015\u201316 La Liga|2015\u201316 season]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=La Liga cancels 2016\u201317 award ceremony |publisher=ESPN |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/story/3231988/la-liga-cancels-award-ceremony-for-2016-17-in-order-to-launch-new-format |access-date=26 October 2018}}</ref> Additional awards relating to La Liga are distributed, some not sanctioned by the Liga de Futbol Profesional or RFEF and therefore not regarded as official. The most notable of these are four awarded by Spain's largest sports paper, ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'', namely the [[Pichichi Trophy]], awarded to the top scorer of the season; the [[Ricardo Zamora Trophy]], for the goalkeeper with the fewest goals allowed per game (minimum 28 games); the [[Trofeo Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano|Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano Trophy]], for the player judged to be the best overall player in the division; and the [[Zarra Trophy]], for the top scorer among Spanish domestic players.\n\nSince the 2013\u201314 season, La Liga has also bestowed the monthly [[La Liga Manager of the Month|manager of the month]] and [[La Liga Player of the Month|player of the month]] awards.\n\n===Transfers===\nThe first La Liga player to be involved in a transfer which broke the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|world record]] was [[Luis Su\u00e1rez (footballer, born 1935)|Luis Su\u00e1rez]] in 1961, who moved from Barcelona to [[Inter Milan]] for \u00a3152,000 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|0.152|1961|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|UK}}). 12 years later, [[Johan Cruyff]] was the first player to join a club in La Liga for a record fee of \u00a3922,000 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|0.922|1973|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|UK}}), when he moved from [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] to Barcelona.
