After a period of mediocrity, the Heat gained relevance in the mid-1990s when [[Pat Riley]] became team president and head coach. Riley constructed the trades of [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Tim Hardaway]], which propelled the team into [[NBA playoffs|playoff]] contention. Mourning and Hardaway led the Heat to four consecutive division titles prior to their departures in 2001 and 2002, respectively. The team also experienced success after drafting [[Dwyane Wade]] in 2003.\n\nLed by Wade and, following a trade for former [[NBA Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) [[Shaquille O'Neal]], the Heat won their first NBA title in [[2006 NBA Finals|2006]], after Riley named himself head coach for a second stint. After the departure of O'Neal two years later, the team struggled for the remainder of the 2000s. Riley remained team president, but was replaced as head coach by [[Erik Spoelstra]]. In 2010, the Heat signed reigning league MVP [[LeBron James]] and [[NBA All-Star]] [[Chris Bosh]], creating the \"[[Big Three (Miami Heat)|Big Three]]\" along with Wade. During their four years together, Spoelstra, James, Wade, and Bosh led the Heat to the NBA Finals in every season, culminating in back-to-back championships in [[2012 NBA Finals|2012]] and [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]]. All three departed by 2016, and the team entered a period of rebuilding. After acquiring All-Star [[Jimmy Butler]] in 2019, the Heat returned to the NBA Finals in [[2020 NBA Finals|2020]]. The Heat acquired six-time [[List of NBA All-Stars|NBA All-Star]] [[Kyle Lowry]] in 2021.\n\nThe Heat hold the record for the NBA's [[List of National Basketball Association longest winning streaks|third-longest winning streak]], 27 straight games, set during the 2012\u201313 season.

The Miami Heat began their early years with much mediocrity, only making the playoffs twice in their first eight years and falling in the first round both times. \n\nMiami had previously been home to the [[Miami Floridians]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) from 1968 to 1972.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/the-best-miami-heat-jerseys-from-vice-versa-to-heat-strong-11818132 | title=The Definitive Ranking of the Miami Heat's Alternate Jerseys }}</ref>\n\n===1995\u20132003: Title hopefuls===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 150\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = 20150902 Quest Multisport clinic Tim Hardaway (1).JPG\n| image2 = Alonzo Mourning (cropped).jpg\n| caption_align = center\n| footer = [[Tim Hardaway]] and [[Alonzo Mourning]] helped make the Heat serious contenders in the eastern conference in the late 1990s.\n| footer_align = centre\n| alt1 = \n}}\nUpon the purchasing of the franchise by [[Carnival Corporation & plc|Carnival Cruise Lines]] chairman [[Micky Arison]] in 1995, [[Pat Riley]] was brought in as the team president and head coach. Riley acquired center [[Alonzo Mourning]] and point guard [[Tim Hardaway]] to serve as the centerpieces for the team, transforming Miami into a championship contender throughout the late 1990s. With them they also brought in a new team trainer, Cody Posselt, to work on shooting. The Heat underwent a dramatic turnaround in the 1996\u201397 season, improving to a 61\u201321 record \u2013 a franchise record at the time, and currently second-best in team history. That same year, Miami earned the moniker of \"Road Warriors\" for its remarkable 32\u20139 record on the road. On the backs of Hardaway and Mourning, the Heat achieved their first two series victories in the playoffs, making it to the Conference Finals against the [[Michael Jordan]]-led [[Chicago Bulls]] before losing in five games. Their biggest rivals of the time were the [[New York Knicks]], Riley's former team, who would eliminate the Heat in the playoffs from 1998 through 2000. A period of mediocrity followed after, highlighted by missing the playoffs in 2002 and 2003.\n\n===2003\u20132016: The Dwyane Wade era===\nIn the [[2003 NBA draft]], with the fifth overall pick, Miami selected shooting guard [[Dwyane Wade]] out of [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]].<ref>{{cite news|title=HEAT Select Dwyane Wade with the 5th Pick in NBA Draft|url=http://www.nba.com/heat/news/draft2003_wade_release.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=HEAT.com|date=June 27, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030704023652/http://www.nba.com/heat/news/draft2003_wade_release.html|archive-date=July 4, 2003|access-date=November 5, 2018}}</ref> Free-agent swing-man [[Lamar Odom]] was signed from the [[Los Angeles Clippers]].

In 2015, they also gained [[Goran Dragi\u0107]] and his younger brother [[Zoran Dragi\u0107]].\n\nAfter a season with several injuries, including to Chris Bosh and Josh McRoberts, the Heat finished with a 37\u201345 record, the NBA's 10th worst. They failed to make the playoffs after being Eastern Conference champions four straight years. It was the second time in Wade's career they did not qualify for the postseason. The Heat were the first team since the [[2004\u201305 Los Angeles Lakers season|2004\u201305 Los Angeles Lakers]] to miss the playoffs after going to the NBA Finals the previous year. Miami had qualified for the playoffs for six consecutive seasons.\n\nAt the 2015 [[NBA draft lottery]], the Heat were awarded the 10th pick for the [[2015 NBA draft]], which was used to select [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] forward [[Justise Winslow]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=BleacherReport|author=Bleacher Report|number=600827735729164289|date=May 20, 2015|title=NBA Draft order for lottery teams after the #NBADraftLottery}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2015\u201316 season, the Heat compiled a 48\u201334 regular season record; however, their season ended in the [[2016 NBA playoffs|Conference Semifinals]] where they lost to the [[Toronto Raptors]].

The home uniforms were white with lettering in red, black and orange trim, while the away uniforms were black with red, white and orange trim; the numbers were white with red, black and orange trim, using the same font as the classic Los Angeles Lakers jerseys. The original 'flaming ball' logo is on the left leg of the shorts while the word 'Miami' is on the right leg.\n\nIn the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]] the Heat introduced a red alternate uniform with lettering and numbers in black, white and orange trim. The original set lasted until the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]].\n\nThe original white and red uniforms were reintroduced as throwback uniforms during the Heat's 20th and 25th anniversary seasons, respectively, while the original black uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2013\u201314 season. The classic white uniforms were used again for the 2015\u201316 season.\n\nAs part of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s uniform contract with the NBA, the so-called \"Classic\" edition was introduced and featured modernized [[throwback uniform]] designs from past years. During the [[2017\u201318 NBA season|2017\u201318 season]], the Heat were one of eight teams who participated in this line and wore their black 1988\u201399 uniforms, updated to the current Nike uniform cut. In the [[2022\u201323 NBA season|2022\u201323 season]], the Heat wore a white version of the uniforms from the same era.\n\n===1999\u2013present uniforms===\nThe current Heat uniforms have been in use since the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]]. These uniforms, though similar, have marked differences such as striping on both sides, change from orange to yellow trim, updated lettering and block numbers, and a modified 'flaming ball' logo on the right leg. The black away uniform numbers are now consistent with the lettering colors (white with red trim).\n\nThe alternate red uniform was introduced during the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]], and features the city name and numbers in white with black trim. With subtle changes like the \"Miami\" wordmark on the black uniforms and the addition of the \"MH\" alternate logo on the shorts, these uniforms remain in use with the Heat today.\n\nFollowing the switch to Nike as the uniform provider in the 2017\u201318 season, the Heat's current uniforms now fall under three categories. The white uniforms are part of the \"Association\" line, the black uniforms are on the \"Icon\" line and the red uniforms are assigned to the \"Statement\" line. All three uniforms are now used regardless of home or away games.\n\n===Special uniforms===\nSince the [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2007\u201308 season]], the Heat participated in the NBA's Noche Latina promotions, or Latin Nights. From 2008 to 2014, the Heat wore a modified version of their black uniforms, featuring the wordmark \"El Heat\"; a sleeved version was used in 2014. For the [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2014\u201315 season]], the Heat wore their white uniforms with the \"El Heat\" wordmark, followed by the Noche Latina version of their red alternates in the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].\n\nThe Heat wore a variation of their current home uniforms on the opening night of the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]], with gold accents and a patch of the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]] on the right chest. They used another variation on opening night of the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], this time with gold lettering.\n\nDuring the 2013\u201314 season, the Heat wore a variation of their current home uniforms, but with the player's names at the back replaced by their nicknames (e.g. 'King James' for LeBron James). They wore the uniforms for select home games that season.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, the Heat wore special monochrome uniforms: an all-black ensemble in the 2011\u201312 season, an all-white version in the 2012\u201313 season, and an all-red attire in the 2013\u201314 season. In 2015, a variation of their all-black uniforms, featuring drop shadows, centered numbers and heavy striping inspired from a [[tuxedo]], was used, followed by a similarly designed white uniform in the 2016\u201317 season.\n\nThe 2015\u201316 season saw the unveiling of two special uniforms. One featured a blend of modern and classic styles (Heat Legacy), while the other is a military-inspired uniform (Home Strong).\n\nThe Heat also participated in the [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|Christmas Day games]] wearing special uniforms. In 2012, they wore monochrome red uniforms known as \"Big Color.\" The following year, they wore their \"Big Logo\" sleeved uniforms, featuring a chrome-treated version of their \"flaming ball\" logo. In 2014, the Heat wore a variation of their home uniform, featuring their primary logo and centered numbers in front, and black nameplates with the player's first name below the number at the back.\n\nThe Heat have also honored the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]]'s [[Miami Floridians]] by donning throwback uniforms; first the road jerseys in the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]], then the home jerseys in the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, the Heat wore special \"City\" uniforms (named as such by Nike to commemorate local cultures and team traditions) that paid homage to the hit 1980s TV series ''[[Miami Vice]]''. The uniforms were white with pink, light blue and black trim and featured the \"Miami\" wordmark inspired from the logo of the [[Miami Arena]].<ref>{{cite news|title=HEAT To Unveil Vice Uniforms|url=https://www.nba.com/heat/heat-unveil-vice-uniforms|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=HEAT.com|date=January 23, 2018|access-date=May 31, 2019}}</ref> For the 2018\u201319 season, the Heat released black versions of the Miami Vice uniforms. In addition, a pink version of the uniform was unveiled as part of Nike's \"Earned\" series which were exclusive only to the 16 teams that qualified in the [[2018 NBA playoffs]]. A light blue version of the uniforms was used in the 2019\u201320 season. The Vice theme continued with the 2020\u201321 \"City\" uniform, this time featuring a pink and blue gradient and black letters.\n\nIn the 2021\u201322 season, the Heat wore special \"City\" uniforms that mixed various uniform styles used by the team. The black-based uniform featured a mix of lettering taken from the Heat's previous and current uniform sets, including the throwback Floridians and Miami Vice \"City\" set. Players were allowed to choose their own number styles. A white version of this uniform served as its 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform.\n\nMiami's 2021 \"Earned\" uniform (rewarded after making the [[2020 NBA playoffs]]) marked the first time the team used yellow as a base color; previously it was only utilized as an accent color on the logo and uniforms. Letters were rendered in black with white trim, but red was not used at all in the uniform.\n\n==Rivalries==\n\n===New York Knicks===\n{{main|Heat\u2013Knicks rivalry}}\nThe rivalry between the [[New York Knicks]] and the expansion Miami Heat was a result of their four consecutive playoff series from 1997 to 2000. Each series went seven games. The rivalry's central figure was [[Pat Riley]], the head coach of both teams (the early 1990s for the Knicks and the late 1990s for the Heat). [[Jeff Van Gundy]] took over Riley's stint as head coach of the Knicks, while his elder brother [[Stan Van Gundy]] was simultaneously an assistant coach for the Heat. [[Patrick Ewing]] and Alonzo Mourning had been friends from their Georgetown college basketball period. Larry Johnson, one of the Knicks, held bad blood with Mourning as far back as their days in the [[Charlotte Hornets]].\n\n===Chicago Bulls===\n\nThe rivalry with the [[Chicago Bulls]] began once the Miami Heat became contenders during the 1990s, a decade dominated by the Bulls and [[Michael Jordan]]. During that period, the Heat were eliminated three times by the Bulls, who would go on to win the NBA championship each time. After Jordan retired and the Heat's fall in the early 2000s, the rivalry cooled but slightly picked up when the Heat faced them in the first round of the 2006 NBA playoffs, which ended in a 4\u20132 Heat series victory and went on to win the NBA Finals. The Bulls would sweep the defending champion Heat in the first round the next season.\n\nThe rivalry has intensified with the resurgence of the Bulls, and the emergence of [[Derrick Rose]] and the Heat re-signing [[Dwyane Wade]] (who turned down a chance of joining his hometown Bulls) with newly acquired superstars in [[Chris Bosh]] and [[LeBron James]] (who spurned a chance of teaming up with Rose in Chicago). The revived rivalry has been very physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between players. Both teams met in the [[NBA Conference Finals|2011 Eastern Conference Finals]], with the Heat winning in five games.\n\nThe Bulls ended the Heat's record-setting 27 game win streak on March 27, 2013, with a 101\u201397 victory at the [[United Center]] in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278782 |title=Miami Heat vs Chicago Bulls \u2013 Recap |publisher=Scores.espn.go.com |date=March 28, 2013 |access-date=May 14, 2015}}</ref> Despite playing without [[Derrick Rose]], [[Joakim Noah]], [[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton]], and [[Marco Belinelli]], the Bulls managed to end the second longest win streak in basketball history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/free/20130325miami-heat-win-th-straight-run-away-from-orlando-magic.html |title=Miami Heat win 27th straight, run away from Orlando Magic |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=March 25, 2013 |access-date=May 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry would continue into the [[2013 NBA playoffs]] when the Heat would play the Bulls in the second round. The Bulls ended another Miami Heat winning streak by beating the Heat 93\u201387 in Game 1. The Heat came back in Game 2 and set a record for the largest margin of victory in franchise playoff history with a 115\u201378 win. The Bulls also set a record for the worst playoff defeat in franchise history. The 51 personal fouls were the most in a playoff game since 1995. In Game 3, [[Nazr Mohammed]] was ejected for shoving [[LeBron James]] early in the second quarter. Norris Cole had his jersey ripped by [[Taj Gibson]] while driving to the basket for a layup. [[Joakim Noah]] was seen applauding and cheering on the image of [[Chris Bosh]] arguing with [[Mario Chalmers]]. Noah received a technical foul for shoving [[Chris Andersen]] after he fell on [[Nate Robinson]]. Chalmers received a flagrant foul for ringing his arm around Noah's neck. [[Taj Gibson]] and Noah were both ejected in the same game for yelling at the referees.\n\n===Orlando Magic===\n{{main|Heat\u2013Magic rivalry}}\nThe Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat had a rivalry because both teams are located in Florida, thus the rivalry was known as the Sunshine State rivalry. Another ingredient to the rivalry was the high-caliber players on both teams such as Orlando's [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]] to Miami's [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Tim Hardaway]]. The two had met each other in the NBA playoffs for the first time in [[1997 NBA playoffs|1997]], with Miami beating Orlando 3\u20132, they have not met in the playoffs since.\n\nThe rivalry intensified with the rising stardom of Miami's and Orlando's [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Dwight Howard]], along with Miami's acquiring high-caliber stars such [[LeBron James]] from the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Chris Bosh]] from the [[Toronto Raptors]] and in 2010, resulting in fierce competition between the two.\n\nWhen Dwight Howard departed from the Magic to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in August 2012, the rivalry softened. The Orlando Magic are undergoing a process of rebuilding, however, competition still remains tense.\n\n===Boston Celtics===\nThe two teams first squared off in the playoffs in [[2010 NBA playoffs|2010]], with the Celtics defeating the Heat four games to one en route to an eventual [[2010 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] appearance by the Celtics. Having suffered first-round losses in three straight years, it was the loss to the Celtics that prompted [[Dwyane Wade]] to declare that the loss would be \"my last\" in the first round for the near future.\n\n[[LeBron James]]' own enmity with the Boston Celtics can be found as far back as his first stint with the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], where the Celtics upset the Cavaliers in 2008 and 2010. Among the two Heat stars, Wade went as far as to say that he personally hates the Celtics, with James' own disdain for Boston manifesting in how he referred to the Celtics exclusively as \"that team\" in 2011. With the acquisition of both James and [[Chris Bosh]] in 2010, the Heat challenged the Celtics for dominance in the Eastern Conference; James claimed that the formation of the Heat's Big 3 was to mirror the formation of the Celtics' Big 3 in [[Paul Pierce]], [[Ray Allen]] and [[Kevin Garnett]]. After dropping the first three games versus the Celtics in the regular season, Miami prevailed in their fourth encounter, taking the 2nd seed from the Celtics and gaining home-court advantage for their eventual match-up of the postseason. The teams met in the Eastern Conference Semifinals of the [[2011 NBA playoffs]], where [[Paul Pierce]] was ejected in Game 1, [[Dwyane Wade]] inadvertently broke [[Rajon Rondo]]'s arm in Game 3 and James scored the final ten points in the deciding Game 5. James could be found roaring to the fans as the Celtics' end came, even kneeling to the ground in relief after finally defeating the Celtics. The rivalry would continue in the following season, where the Heat again took home-court advantage over the Celtics, though Boston again won the season series over the Heat. Despite the loss of Bosh to injury in the semifinals, the Heat took a 2\u20130 lead before the Celtics won the next three games; the first five games included two overtimes, Rondo's 44 point performance in Game 2, as well as Pierce and James fouling out in Game 4. James' 45 point performance in Game 6 at Boston forced a deciding seventh game, where the two teams traded blows deep into the third and fourth quarters, before Miami pulled away with a 4\u20133 victory en route to the [[NBA Finals]].\n\nIn the off-season, the Celtics' Big 3 was broken up following [[Ray Allen]]'s joining of the Heat. When asked about their immediate reactions to their teammate leaving for their rival, [[Kevin Garnett]] claimed that he deleted Allen's phone number, while [[Paul Pierce]] admitted that it \"hurt\", though he still considers Allen \"a brother to me\" for their 2008 championship run. Although the two teams would not meet in the playoffs, the animosity continued in their four regular-season games. The season opener \u2013 a Heat victory \u2013 included Rondo clotheslining Wade's neck, Garnett snubbing a handshake from Allen pre-game, and Garnett throwing an elbow at [[Mario Chalmers]]. During Miami's 2013 streak, [[Paul Pierce]] went on record to say that he wished for Miami to lose all of its remaining games by that point. When James voiced his displeasure over the Chicago Bulls' physicality against him, Boston's general manager [[Danny Ainge]] called it \"embarrassing\" for LeBron to complain about it. [[Pat Riley]], the Heat team president, retorted that \"Danny should shut the fuck up.\" The teams met during the streak, where it was five years to the day that the Celtics' stopped the [[Houston Rockets]]' own 20+-game winning streak. It ended in a Heat victory, one that featured James dunking on [[Jason Terry]]; he received a technical foul for staring down at Terry post-dunk. When asked about it after the game by reporters, James stated that he was \"glad it happened to him.\"\n\n===Indiana Pacers===\nA recent rivalry was triggered with the [[Indiana Pacers]] in the Eastern Conference semifinals of the [[2012 NBA playoffs]]. Although the two previously met in the [[2004 NBA playoffs]] (when Indiana won 4\u20132), as of 2014, the only player still left from either team is [[Udonis Haslem]] of the Heat. Both head coaches were fined for statements made relating to the officiating: [[Frank Vogel]] accused the Heat of flopping before the series started, while [[Erik Spoelstra]] took offense to what he perceived to be deliberate head-hunting of his players on the part of the Pacers. Indiana took a 2\u20131 lead after Miami's [[Chris Bosh]] was sidelined with an abdominal strain. Powered by [[LeBron James]] and [[Dwyane Wade]], Miami won three straight games to take the series, 4\u20132. The series was marked by several suspensions, flagrant fouls, and confrontations between the players: [[Tyler Hansbrough]]'s flagrant foul on Dwyane Wade (which drew blood), Udonis Haslem's retaliatory flagrant foul on Hansborough (which led to Haslem's Game 6 suspension), Wade colliding with [[Darren Collison]] in transition, [[Juwan Howard]] confronting [[Lance Stephenson]] over the latter's flashing of the choke sign to James, and [[Dexter Pittman]] elbowing Stephenson in the neck (which led to his own three-game suspension). Indiana's [[Danny Granger]] received technical fouls in three consecutive games for his confrontations with Heat players; he stripped James of his headband in Game 2 while attempting to block a shot, pulled the back of James' jersey in Game 3 while trying to stop a fast-break, and chest-bumped Wade in Game 4 after the latter was fouled by [[Roy Hibbert]].\n\nThe following season saw improvements for both teams, from Miami's acquisition of [[Ray Allen]] and [[Chris Andersen]], to the emergence of [[Paul George]] and [[Lance Stephenson]]. Notably, it was after the Heat lost to the Pacers that they compiled a 27-game winning streak; the last time the Heat lost two in a row in the year were the games against Indiana and Portland. During the waning minutes of Game 6 in the semifinals between the Pacers and the [[New York Knicks]], the Pacers' fans were chanting \"Beat the Heat\" as their team beat their old New York rivals. True to form, the Heat and the Pacers met in the Conference Finals of the [[2013 NBA playoffs]] on May 22, 2013. Several instances of physicality became prominent in the series: [[Shane Battier]] received an offensive foul for throwing his knee at Hibbert's midsection; Hibbert claimed that it was an intentional dirty play on the part of Battier. Andersen suffered a bloodied nose after colliding with [[David West (basketball)|David West]]. [[Ian Mahinmi]] received a retroactive flagrant foul for a grab of James' arm. Norris Cole latched a hand on West's groin area as he tried to slip through West. Wade received a retroactive flagrant foul for hitting Stephenson in the head, another incident that the Pacers, notably Paul George, felt was a dirty play. The Heat survived Game 1 on a James game-winning layup, while the Pacers came back to tie the series at 1\u20131 after forcing James into two late fourth-quarter turnovers for Game 2. In Game 3, the Heat set a team record for points in a postseason half with 70. It was the first time the Pacers had given up 70 points since 1992. Allen's single turnover was the least ever suffered by the Heat in a first half. Their five total turnovers is tied for the fewest in franchise history. The Game 3 victory marked the first time that an NBA team had won five straight road games by double digits. The Heat won the series 4\u20133, with a 99\u201376 win in Game 7.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Tim|title=Heat off to Finals, beat Pacers 99-76 in Game 7|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20130603/INDMIA/gameinfo.html?ls=pot|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=June 3, 2013|access-date=November 5, 2018}}</ref> In the [[2014 NBA playoffs]], after beating the [[Brooklyn Nets]] in five games, and the Pacers beating the [[Washington Wizards]] in six games, the Heat and the first-seeded Pacers would meet up in the Eastern Conference Finals in a much-anticipated rematch. The Heat would go on to eliminate the Pacers 4\u20132, advancing to their fourth consecutive NBA Finals in the Big Three-era. The Heat stumbled during Game 1 in Indianapolis, falling 96\u2013107. They would win Games 2\u20134. During Game 5 (which Miami lost 90\u201393), James struggled, suffering heavy foul trouble and scoring only 7 points, his lowest playoff record. During Game 6 in Miami, the Heat would blow out the Pacers 117\u201392.\n\n===Dallas Mavericks===\nThe Heat\u2013Mavericks rivalry began in the [[2006 NBA Finals]], where the two teams met and both entering their first NBA Finals appearance. A year prior, the Heat had acquired [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. The Mavericks were led by [[Dirk Nowitzki]], and the Heat were led by [[Dwyane Wade]]. Dallas had home-court advantage in the series due to a better regular-season record (60\u201322) than Miami's (52\u201330) and took the first two games in the series, entering Game 3 with a commanding 2\u20130 lead. They looked set to win Game 3 until a rally by the Heat, including many free throws from Wade, resulted in the Mavericks losing the third game. The Heat won all of its home games, as the Mavericks dropped games 3, 4 and 5. In a highly controversial Game 5, a 101\u2013100 victory for the Heat, Wade shot more free throws than the entire Mavericks team. Mavericks owner [[Mark Cuban]], as well as Nowitzki, were both fined for acts of misconduct. During Game 6, the series returned to Dallas, where the Mavericks fell 92\u201395. [[Jason Terry]] airballed a three-point attempt that could have tied the game. Wade picked up the ball, throwing it in the air in celebration as the Heat won the NBA Championship, and its first one as well. Wade was named the Finals MVP.\n\nIn the 2010 off-season, Miami acquired [[LeBron James]] from the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Chris Bosh]] from the [[Toronto Raptors]] to team up with Wade and form their own \"big three\" (to rival the [[Boston Celtics|Celtics]]' big three) that was expected to win the championship. The Heat finished 58\u201324, acquiring the southeast division title and the second seed in the Eastern Conference. During the regular season, the Mavericks swept the Heat 2\u20130. The Heat cruised through the Playoffs without much competition, eliminating every team \u2013 the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], defending Eastern Conference champions [[Boston Celtics]] and the top-seeded [[Chicago Bulls]] all five games. Meanwhile, the Mavericks had tallied 57\u201325 for the third seed, leaving them to face the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in the first round. The Mavericks had been defeated in the first round all but one time since the 2006 Finals, including a defeat from the seventh-seeded [[San Antonio Spurs]] just the previous season. Because of this, the Mavericks were underdogs throughout the playoffs, but they were able to dispatch Portland in six games. They faced the defending NBA champions [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and pulled off the impossible by sweeping them, ending their bid for a three-peat. In the Conference Finals, they defeated the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]], resulting a rematch between the two teams. After taking a 2\u20131 lead however, the Heat stumbled in the next three games. They were eliminated on their own home floor after losing 95\u2013105 during Game 6 in Miami \u2013 extending LeBron's quest for a ring. The loss had also brought further public humiliation for [[LeBron James]], who had been scrutinized and negatively criticized for leaving the Cavaliers to join the Heat. LeBron was criticized for only averaging 17.8 points. Cavaliers fans rejoiced in the Heat's loss due to the anger that was caused by LeBron's decision to join the Heat, which they felt was unfair and a betrayal.\n\nAfter that, the Mavericks would never win another game against the Heat. Dallas hosted the Heat for the season opener on December 25, 2011, of the lockout-shortened 2011\u201312 season that was shortened to 66 games. The Heat spoiled the Mavericks' championship banner-raising night, giving them a 105\u201394 blowout loss.\n\nAlthough the Heat and the Mavericks have not met in the postseason ever since, the rivalry continued as [[Mark Cuban]] publicly discussed his extreme personal dislike for the Heat. He described \"hate\" was not being strong enough of a word to describe his dislike for the Heat.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dan Favale |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1921640-mark-cuban-hate-not-strong-enough-word-to-describe-dislike-of-miami-heat |title=Mark Cuban: Hate Not 'Strong Enough' Word to Describe Dislike of Miami Heat |website=Bleacher Report |date=January 13, 2014 |access-date=May 14, 2015}}</ref> He also had a personal dislike for Wade.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n''List of the last five seasons completed by the Heat.

For the first four years of the franchise, there were radio-television simulcasts of locally broadcast games before the franchise eventually created separate broadcast teams.\n\n[[WBFS-TV]] (channel 33) was the original over-the-air flagship station for Heat games, with its first stint concluding at the end of the [[1998\u201399 Miami Heat season|1998\u201399 season]], after 11 seasons. [[WAMI-TV]] (channel 69) took over the [[1999\u20132000 Miami Heat season|following season]]; however, WBFS (along with now-sister station [[WFOR-TV|WFOR]] channel 4) returned as the Heat's primary over-the-air home in [[2000\u201301 Miami Heat season|2000\u201301]], this time lasting until the [[2003\u201304 Miami Heat season|2003\u201304 season]]. On the cable side, Heat games were televised on then-SportsChannel Florida (now [[Bally Sports Florida]]), before moving to then-Sunshine Network (later Sun Sports and Fox Sports Sun, now Bally Sports Sun) starting in the 1992\u201393 season. Since 2004\u201305, Sun Sports have served as the exclusive regional carrier of Heat games throughout the team's designated broadcast territory, which includes the metropolitan areas of [[South Florida metropolitan area|Miami\u2013Fort Lauderdale]], [[Treasure Coast|West Palm Beach\u2013Fort Pierce\u2013Port St. Lucie]], and [[Southwest Florida|Fort Myers\u2013Naples]].\n\nOn a national scale, games are occasionally televised by [[NBA on TNT|TNT]], [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]], or [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]].\n\nFrom 1988 to 1993, the Heat were on [[WQAM]]. [[WINZ (AM)|WINZ]] previously aired games from 1993 to 1996 and [[WIOD]] did from 1996 to 2008.\n\n==Players==\n{{Hatnote|For the complete list of Miami Heat players, see: [[Miami Heat all-time roster]].}}\n{{Hatnote|For the players drafted by the Miami Heat, see: [[Miami Heat draft history]].}}\n\n===Current roster===\n{{Miami Heat roster}}\n\n===Retained draft rights===\nThe Heat hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.

[[Ron Rothstein]] was the franchise's first head coach, serving from 1988 through 1991; he remains as assistant coach. [[Kevin Loughery]] was his successor from 1991 to 1995, guiding the Heat to their first two playoff berths in 1992 and 1994. Loughery was fired 46 games into the 1994\u201395 season, posting a 17\u201329 record. [[Alvin Gentry]], an assistant coach who joined in 1991, was brought in to replace Loughery on an interim basis. Miami went 15\u201321 for the final 36 games, and Gentry moved to the [[Detroit Pistons]] the following season.\n\nIn the summer of 1995, owner [[Micky Arison]] hired [[Pat Riley]] as the head coach and team president. At eleven years, Riley is the longest-tenured head coach in the franchise's history, as well its all-time leader in total wins and games coached. Upon suffering a 25\u201357 record in the 2002\u201303 season, Riley abruptly announced his retirement, but remained as team president. He elevated assistant coach [[Stan Van Gundy]] as his replacement. Van Gundy is Miami's all-time leader for the highest [[winning percentage]] in the regular season (.605), having led Miami to a 42\u201340 record in his first season and a 59\u201323 record in his second year. He spearheaded Miami's 2005 campaign, where they held the top seed in the east, swept their first two playoff opponents and made it to the Conference Finals.\n\nAn 11\u201310 record early into the 2005\u201306 season prompted Riley to come out of retirement and replace Van Gundy. Shortly thereafter, Riley would win his fifth and final championship as a head coach, as well as Miami's first championship in 2006. Riley would retire permanently following the 15-win 2007\u201308 season, but once again remained as team president. His hand-picked replacement, longtime assistant [[Erik Spoelstra]], is the current Heat head coach, a position he has held since 2008. At 38, he was the youngest head coach in the league at the time, as well as the first [[Filipino-American]] head coach in league history.
