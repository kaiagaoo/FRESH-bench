Conversely, in the 1996 episode \"[[You Only Move Twice]]\", Hank Scorpio gives Homer Simpson the Denver Broncos as a thank-you gift for helping him. However, Homer complains that he wanted to own the [[Dallas Cowboys]], as the Broncos team that just arrived are playing very sloppy football on his front lawn (a reference to the team losing four Super Bowl appearances, three by significant margins including [[Super Bowl XII]] against Dallas). Incidentally, the Broncos were 13\u20133 in the 1996 season, and won the Super Bowl the next two seasons. Only two seasons later in the Super Bowl-centric episode \"[[Sunday, Cruddy Sunday]]\", Homer chooses Denver as his [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] pick over Moe's choice of the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. In the episode, \"[[The Bonfire of the Manatees]]\", Homer picks the Broncos to win the Super Bowl over the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. The two teams later did play against each other in [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] which aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], the U.S. home of ''The Simpsons''; but the result was a Seahawks victory instead.\n* In the 1979 ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'' episode \"Hold That Mork\", Mork's character, played by [[Robin Williams]], became the first male [[Denver Broncos Cheerleaders|cheerleader in Broncos' history]].
