The Braves compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League East|East division]]. The Braves were founded in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1871, as the '''Boston Red Stockings'''.

Then, in 1953, the team [[relocation of professional sports teams|moved]] to [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], and became the '''Milwaukee Braves''', followed by their move to Atlanta in 1966. \n\nThe name \"Braves\" originates from [[Braves (Native Americans)|a term for a Native American warrior]]. They are [[List of baseball nicknames|nicknamed]] \"the Bravos\", and often referred to as \"[[America's Team#Other uses|America's Team]]\" in reference to the team's games being broadcast nationally on [[Braves TBS Baseball|TBS]] from the 1970s until 2007, giving the team a nationwide fan base.\n\nThe Braves and the [[Chicago Cubs]] are the National League's two remaining charter franchises.

The Red Caps/Beaneaters were one of the league's dominant teams during the 19th century, winning a total of eight pennants. For most of that time, their [[manager (baseball)|manager]] was [[Frank Selee]]. Boston came to be called the ''Beaneaters'' in 1883 while retaining red as the team color. The [[1898 Boston Beaneaters season|1898 team]] finished 102\u201347, a club record for wins that would stand for [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|almost a century]]. Stars of those 1890s Beaneater teams included the \"Heavenly Twins\", [[Hugh Duffy]] and [[Tommy McCarthy (baseball)|Tommy McCarthy]], as well as \"Slidin'\" [[Billy Hamilton (baseball, born 1866)|Billy Hamilton]].\n\nThe team was decimated when the [[American League]]'s new Boston entry set up shop in 1901. Many of the Beaneaters' stars jumped to the new team, which offered contracts that the Beaneaters' owners did not even bother to match. They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913 and lost 100 games five times. In 1907, the Beaneaters (temporarily) eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected, as noted in ''The Sporting News Baseball Guide'' in the 1940s. The American League club's owner, Charles Taylor, wasted little time in adopting [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] as his team's first official nickname (up to that point they had been called by the generic \"Americans\"). Media-driven nickname changes to the ''Doves'' in 1907 and the ''Rustlers'' in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club's luck. The team became the ''Braves'' for the first time before the [[1912 Boston Braves season|1912 season]].<ref name=\"bgbraves\">{{cite news |title=Ward Wants His Team to be Called the \"Boston Braves\" |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24553764/ |first1=T.H. |last1=Murnane |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=December 21, 1911 |access-date=February 21, 2020 |archive-date=April 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210423003929/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24553764/the-boston-globe/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The president of the club, John M.

Nevertheless, the Braves swept the Athletics\u2014the first unqualified sweep in the young history of the modern [[World Series]] (the [[1907 World Series|1907 Series]] had one tied game) to win the world championship. Meanwhile, [[Johnny Evers]] won the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Chalmers Award]].\n\nThe Braves played the World Series (as well as the last few games of the 1914 season) at [[Fenway Park]], since their normal home, the [[South End Grounds]], was too small. However, the Braves' success inspired owner Gaffney to build a modern park, [[Braves Field]], which opened in August 1915. It was the largest park in the majors at the time, with 40,000 seats and a very spacious outfield. The park was novel for its time; public transportation brought fans right to the park.\n\n====1915\u20131953====\nAfter contending for most of 1915 and 1916, the Braves only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932. The lone highlight of those years came when Judge [[Emil Fuchs (baseball)|Emil Fuchs]] bought the team in 1923 to bring his longtime friend, pitching great [[Christy Mathewson]], back into the game. However, Mathewson died in 1925, leaving Fuchs in control of the team.\n\nFuchs was committed to building a winner, but the damage from the years prior to his arrival took some time to overcome. The Braves finally managed to be competitive in 1933 and 1934 under manager [[Bill McKechnie]], but Fuchs' revenue was severely depleted due to the [[Great Depression]].\n\nLooking for a way to get more fans and more money, Fuchs worked out a deal with the [[New York Yankees]] to acquire [[Babe Ruth]], who had started his career with the Red Sox. Fuchs made Ruth team vice president, and promised him a share of the profits. He was also granted the title of assistant manager, and was to be consulted on all of the Braves' deals. Fuchs even suggested that Ruth, who had long had his heart set on managing, could take over as manager once McKechnie stepped down\u2014perhaps as early as 1936.<ref name=\"Neyer\">{{cite book |last=Neyer |first=Rob |author-link=Rob Neyer |title=Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Blunders |year=2006 |publisher=Fireside |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7432-8491-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/robneyersbigbook0000neye}}</ref>\n\nAt first, it appeared that Ruth was the final piece the team needed in 1935. On opening day, he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4\u20132 win over the [[1936 New York Giants (MLB) season|Giants]]. However, that proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500 all year. Events went downhill quickly. While Ruth could still hit, he could do little else. He could not run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if Ruth were in the lineup. It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was hot air. In fact, Ruth discovered that Fuchs expected him to invest some of ''his'' money in the team.<ref name=\"Neyer\"/>\n\nSeeing a franchise in complete disarray, Ruth retired on June 1\u2014only six days after he clouted what turned out to be the last three [[home run]]s of his career. He had wanted to quit as early as May 12, but Fuchs wanted him to hang on so he could play in every National League park.<ref name=\"Neyer\"/> The Braves finished 38\u2013115, the worst season in franchise history. Their .248 winning percentage is the second-worst in the modern era and the second-worst in National League history (ahead of the [[1899 Cleveland Spiders season|1899 Cleveland Spiders]] with a .130 winning percentage).\n\nFuchs lost control of the team in August 1935,<ref name=\"Neyer\"/> and the new owners tried to change the team's image by renaming it the '''Boston Bees'''. This did little to change the team's fortunes. After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate [[Lou Perini]], changed the nickname back to the Braves. He immediately set about rebuilding the team. World War II slowed things down a little, but the team rode the pitching of [[Warren Spahn]] to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.\n\n[[File:Warren Spahn Pitching transparency 1952 March 21.png|thumb|upright=1.0|Hall of Fame pitcher [[Warren Spahn]]]]\nIn 1948, the [[1948 Boston Braves season|team]] won the pennant, behind the pitching of Spahn and [[Johnny Sain]], who won 39 games between them. The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September, ''Boston Post'' writer Gerald Hern wrote this poem about the pair:\n:''First we'll use Spahn''\n:''then we'll use Sain''\n:''Then an off day''\n:''followed by rain''\n:''Back will come Spahn''\n:''followed by Sain''\n:''And followed''\n:''we hope''\n:''by two days of rain.''\n\nThe poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as ''\"Spahn and Sain and pray for rain\"'', entered the baseball vocabulary. However, in the 1948 season, the Braves had the same overall winning percentage as in games that Spahn and Sain started.\n\nThe [[1948 World Series]], which the Braves lost in six games to the [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]], turned out to be the Braves' last hurrah in Boston. In 1950, [[Sam Jethroe]] became the team's first African American player, making his major league debut on April 18. Amid four mediocre seasons, attendance steadily dwindled until, on March 13, 1953, Perini, who had recently bought out his original partners, announced he was moving the team to [[Milwaukee]], where the Braves had their top farm club, the [[Milwaukee Brewers minor league|Brewers]]. Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation. [[Bill Veeck]] had tried to return his [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] there earlier the same year (Milwaukee was the original home of that franchise), but his proposal had been voted down by the other American League owners.\n\n===Milwaukee (1953\u20131965)===\n{{see also|History of the Atlanta Braves#Milwaukee}}\n\nMilwaukee went wild over the Braves, drawing a then-NL record 1.8&nbsp;million fans. The Braves finished 92\u201362 in their first season in Milwaukee. The success of the relocated team showed that baseball could succeed in new markets, and the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]], [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], and [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] left their hometowns within the next five years.\n\n[[File:MilwaukeeBaseballM.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|Milwaukee Braves cap logo]]\nAs the 1950s progressed, the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive. Sluggers [[Eddie Mathews]] and [[Hank Aaron]] drove the offense (they hit a combined 1,226 home runs as Braves, with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee and 863 coming while they were teammates), often aided by another power hitter, [[Joe Adcock]], while [[Warren Spahn]], [[Lew Burdette]], and [[Bob Buhl]] anchored the rotation. The 1956 Braves finished second, only one game behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nIn [[1957 Milwaukee Braves season|1957]], the Braves celebrated their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by Aaron's [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP season]], as he led the National League in home runs and RBI. Perhaps the most memorable of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23, a two-run [[walk-off home run]] that gave the Braves a 4\u20132 victory over the [[1957 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and clinched the League championship. The team then went on to its first [[World Series]] win in over 40 years, defeating the powerful [[1957 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] of [[Yogi Berra|Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle|Mantle]], and [[Whitey Ford|Ford]] in seven games. One-time Yankee Burdette, the Series MVP, threw three complete-game victories against his former team, giving up only two earned runs.\n\nIn [[1958 Milwaukee Braves season|1958]], the Braves again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against the [[1958 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] once more, thanks in part to the strength of Spahn's and Burdette's pitching. But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP [[Bob Turley]]'s pitching.\n[[File:Hank Aaron 1974.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[Hank Aaron]]]]\nThe [[1959 Milwaukee Braves season|1959 season]] saw the Braves finish the season in a tie with the [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], both with 86\u201368 records. Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about {{convert|75|mi|km|0}} apart, but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers. The Dodgers would go on to defeat the [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[1959 World Series|World Series]].\n\nThe next six years were up-and-down for the Braves. The 1960 season featured two no-hitters by Burdette and Spahn, and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the [[1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], who went on to win the [[1960 World Series|World Series]] that year, in second place, one year after the Braves were on the winning end of the 13-inning near-perfect game of Pirates pitcher [[Harvey Haddix]]. The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down to fourth, despite Spahn recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.\n\nAaron hit 45 [[home run]]s in 1962, a Milwaukee career high for him, but this did not translate into wins for the Braves, as they finished fifth. [[1963 in baseball|The next season]], Aaron again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI, and 42-year-old Warren Spahn was once again the ace of the staff, going 23\u20137. However, none of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the \"[[first division (baseball)|second division]]\", for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Braves were mediocre as the 1960s began, with an inflated win total fed by the expansion [[New York Mets]] and [[Houston Colt .45s]]. To this day, the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team that played more than one season and never had a losing record.\n\nPerini sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by [[William Bartholomay]] in 1962. Almost immediately Bartholomay started shopping the Braves to a larger television market. Keen to attract them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor [[Ivan Allen Jr.]] constructed a new $18&nbsp;million, 52,000-seat ballpark in less than one year, [[Atlanta Stadium]], which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing major league baseball and/or NFL/AFL team. After the city failed to lure the [[History of the Oakland Athletics#Kansas City (1955\u20131967)|Kansas City A's]] to Atlanta (the A's ultimately moved to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season. However, an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year. In 1966, the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.\n\n[[Eddie Mathews]] is the only Braves player to have played for the organization in all three cities that they have been based in. Mathews played with the Braves for their last season in Boston, the team's entire tenure in Milwaukee, and their first season in Atlanta.\n\n===Atlanta (1966\u2013present)===\n\n====1966\u20131974====\nThe Braves were a .500 team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85\u201377 in 1966, 77\u201385 in 1967, and 81\u201381 in 1968. The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their last year in Boston. In 1969, with the onset of divisional play, the Braves won the first-ever [[National League West]] Division title, before being swept by the \"[[1969 New York Mets season|Miracle Mets]]\" in the [[1969 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. They would not be a factor during the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 \u2013 in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.\n\n[[File:Aaron 715.jpg|thumb|upright|The fence over which Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run still exists outside of [[Center Parc Stadium]].]]\nIn the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of [[Hank Aaron]]. In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium (\"The Launching Pad\"), he actually increased his offensive production. Atlanta also produced batting champions in [[Rico Carty]] (in 1970) and [[Ralph Garr]] (in 1974). In the shadow of Aaron's historical home run pursuit, was the fact that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 \u2013 [[Darrell Evans]] and [[Davey Johnson]] along with Aaron.\n\nBy the end of the 1973 season, Aaron had hit 713 home runs, one short of Ruth's record. Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure. On April 4, opening day of the [[1974 Major League Baseball season|next season]], he hit No.714 in [[1974 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]], and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience, he finally beat Ruth's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander [[Al Downing (baseball)|Al Downing]] of the [[1974 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before being traded to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] on November 2, 1974.\n\n====Ted Turner era====\n\n=====1976\u20131977: Ted Turner buys the team=====\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0434\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044f 10.1.jpg|thumb|Media magnate [[Ted Turner]] purchased the team in 1976, and played a large role in the team's operation.]]\n\nIn 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate [[Ted Turner]], owner of [[superstation]] [[TBS (TV network)|WTBS]], as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium]]. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself [[manager (baseball)|manager]], but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the [[1977 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] lost 2\u20131 to the [[1977 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] to bring their losing streak to 17 games).\n\nTurner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base. WTBS marketed the team as \"The Atlanta Braves: [[America's Team]]\", a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially [[Southern United States|the South]]. Among other things, in 1976 Turner suggested the nickname \"Channel\" for pitcher [[Andy Messersmith]] and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired [[Braves TBS Baseball|Braves games]]. Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.\n\n=====1978\u20131990=====\nAfter three straight losing seasons, [[Bobby Cox]] was hired for his first stint as manager for the 1978 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-10-23-sp-13995-story.html|title=Blue Jays' Cox Leaves Land of the Freeze for the Home of the Braves|date=October 23, 1985|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=June 23, 2022}}</ref> He promoted 22-year-old slugger [[Dale Murphy]] into the starting lineup. Murphy hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, but he struggled on defense, unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base. In 1980, Murphy was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974. Cox was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with [[Joe Torre]], under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969. Strong performances from [[Bob Horner]], [[Chris Chambliss]], pitcher [[Phil Niekro]], and short relief pitcher [[Gene Garber]] helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than Murphy, who won both a [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player]] and a [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove award]]. Murphy also won an MVP award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy, excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990. Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games. The 1986 season saw the return of Bobby Cox as [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]]. Also in 1986, the team stopped using their Indian-themed mascot, [[Chief Noc-A-Homa]].\n\n=====1991\u20132005: Division dominance=====\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer= [[Greg Maddux]], [[Tom Glavine]], and [[John Smoltz]] combined for six [[Cy Young Award]]s during their time in the Braves pitching rotation\n| width= 175\n| direction= vertical\n| image1 =\n| alt1= Greg Maddux\n| image2= Tom Glavine Pitching 1993.jpg\n| alt2= Tom Glavine\n| image3= JohnSmoltz.jpg\n| alt3= John Smoltz\n}}\n\nFrom 1991 to 2005 the Braves were one of most consistently winning teams in baseball.<ref name=\"14div\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/braves-14-straight-titles-should-be-cheered-c237410912|title=Braves' 14 straight division titles should be cheered|website=MLB|date=June 19, 2017|access-date=September 18, 2022|first1=Tracy|last1=Ringolsby}}</ref> The Braves won a record 14 straight division titles, five National League pennants, and one World Series title in 1995. Bobby Cox returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing [[Russ Nixon]]. The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65\u201397. They traded Dale Murphy to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach [[Leo Mazzone]] began developing young pitchers [[Tom Glavine]], [[Steve Avery (baseball)|Steve Avery]], and [[John Smoltz]] into future stars. That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the [[1990 Major League Baseball draft|1990 MLB draft]] to select [[Chipper Jones]], who became one of the best hitters in team history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/chipper-jones-right-pick-for-braves-in-1990-c287784536|title=Chipper a wise choice for Braves in 1990 Draft|last=Bowman|first=Mark|website=MLB.com|access-date=July 28, 2018|archive-date=October 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023210826/https://www.mlb.com/news/chipper-jones-right-pick-for-braves-in-1990-c287784536|url-status=live}}</ref> Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, [[John Schuerholz]] was hired away from the [[Kansas City Royals]] as general manager.\n\nThe following season, Glavine, Avery, and Smoltz would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them.  Meanwhile, behind position players [[David Justice]], [[Ron Gant]] and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion [[Terry Pendleton]], the [[1991 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] overcame a 39\u201340 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the [[1991 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] by one game in one of baseball's more memorable playoff races. The \"Worst to First\" Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta (and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag. They defeated the [[1991 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a very tightly contested seven-game [[1991 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] only to lose the [[1991 World Series|World Series]], also in seven games, to the [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. The series, considered by many to be one of the greatest ever, was the first time a team that had finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat.\n\nDespite the 1991 World Series loss, the Braves' success would continue. In 1992, the [[1992 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] returned to the [[1992 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] and once again defeated the [[1992 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pirates]] in seven games, culminating in a [[Francisco Cabrera game|dramatic game seven win]]. [[Francisco Cabrera (baseball)|Francisco Cabrera]]'s two-out single that scored David Justice and Sid Bream capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3\u20132 victory. It was the first time in post-season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning. The Braves lost the [[1992 World Series|World Series]] to the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], however. In 1993, the Braves signed [[Cy Young Award]] winning pitcher [[Greg Maddux]] from the [[Chicago Cubs]], leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the best in baseball.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1992/12/10/maddux-to-braves-for-28-million/4d16b3f3-a534-4808-9761-42da3ab5039d/|title=Maddux To Braves For $28 Million|last=Maske|first=Mark|date=December 10, 1992|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=June 5, 2020|archive-date=June 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606051349/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1992/12/10/maddux-to-braves-for-28-million/4d16b3f3-a534-4808-9761-42da3ab5039d/|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|1993 team]] posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the [[1993 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], who won 103 games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ATL/1993.shtml|title=Atlanta Braves 1993 Summary|publisher=baseball-reference.com|access-date=July 7, 2008|archive-date=July 9, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709035421/http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ATL/1993.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> The Braves needed a stunning 55\u201319 finish to edge out the Giants, who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11.

The \"screaming Indian\" patch was added on the left sleeve.\n\n===1968\u20131971===\nDuring this period navy became the team's primary color, and pinstripes were worn on the home uniform. The chest numbers and piping were removed, with red only used exclusively on the road uniform. The original navy/red cap was only used at home, while an all-navy cap was used on the road. By 1969, the all-navy cap served as the primary, retiring the navy/red cap.\n\n===1972\u20131975===\nThe Braves entered the polyester era with a new look, changing from navy to royal blue while keeping red as a trim color. Home uniforms were white with blue sleeves, while road uniforms were blue with white sleeves. Chest numbers returned with this uniform. Both sleeves contain a feather patch. Caps became royal blue with white panels, along with a lowercase \"a\" in red with white and blue trim.\n\n===1976\u20131979===\nThe Braves returned to wearing pinstripes and gray uniforms with this set. The home uniform removed the blue sleeves and feather patch, and replaced them with red pinstripes and collar. The road uniform kept the previous template but returned to a gray base with blue sleeves, with the feather patch exclusive only to the left sleeve. The road uniform also featured a script \"Atlanta\" in front, with the first \"a\" in lowercase. In 1979, blue player names were added to the road uniform.\n\n===1980\u20131986===\nThe Braves' home uniform again removed the pinstripes and added player names in blue. Collars and sleeves featured red, white and blue stripes. The road uniform was changed to powder blue minus the contrasting sleeve colors and red trim. In 1981, the road uniform was tweaked slightly, adopting the uppercase \"A\" script on the word \"Atlanta\". The Braves also wore two all-blue caps: the home cap featured the white \"A\" script with red trim, while the road cap lacked the red trim on the \"A\".\n\n===1987\u2013present===\nThe Braves updated their uniform set in 1987, returning to buttoned uniforms and belted pants. This design returned to the classic look they wore in the 1950s.\n\nThe white home uniform features red and navy piping, the \"Braves\" script and tomahawk in front, and radially arched (vertically arched until 2005; sewn into a nameplate until 2012) navy letters and red numbers with navy trim at the back. The gray road uniforms are identical to the white home uniforms save for the \"Atlanta\" script in front.<ref>{{cite web|title=Braves Uniforms|url=https://www.mlb.com/braves/history/uniforms|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=Braves.com|access-date=January 19, 2019|archive-date=April 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418025008/https://www.mlb.com/braves/history/uniforms|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the cap worn with both uniforms is the red-brimmed navy cap with the script \"A\" in front. In 2008, an all-navy cap was introduced and became the primary road cap the following season.\n\nThe Braves have had three different versions of their Friday red alternate home uniform. The first uniform, worn from 2005 to 2013, featured navy and white piping, navy \"Braves\" script and tomahawk in front, and white letters and navy numbers with white trim at the back. It was paired with a navy cap with red brim featuring the alternate \"tomahawk A\" logo. From 2014 to 2018, the Braves tweaked the uniform; the \"Braves\" script was now adorned with stars while the tomahawk was removed. The \"tomahawk A\" cap was also retired. In 2019, the Braves reverted to a variation of the original red alternate uniform minus the white piping.\n\nThe cream alternate uniforms were introduced in February 2012 as a tribute to the Braves' first season in Atlanta in 1966. This set is similar to the primary home uniform, but with chest numbers in place of the tomahawk and blue piping minus the red accents. An alternate \"crossing tomahawks\" logo featuring the team name and foundation date was added to the left sleeve.<ref>{{cite news|title=Atlanta Braves unveil a new alternate home uniform|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/braves-unveil-new-alternate-home-uniform/c-26583682|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|date=February 6, 2012|access-date=April 19, 2018|archive-date=April 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420010428/https://www.mlb.com/news/braves-unveil-new-alternate-home-uniform/c-26583682|url-status=live}}</ref> The Braves quit wearing the cream alternate uniforms after the 2019 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=What happened to the Braves' alternate jerseys?|url=https://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-braves/what-happened-to-the-braves-alternate-jerseys/SSWERRW3D5BZXPTPJTFERFCLFU/|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=May 18, 2022|access-date=September 20, 2022|first1=Justin|last1=Toscano}}</ref>\n\nThe Braves have worn two versions of their alternate navy blue road jerseys. The first iteration was introduced on opening night of the 2008 season against the Washington Nationals, and featured navy lettering. The only red elements on the uniform can be seen on the tomahawk. For 2019, the Braves drastically changed the uniform to feature red lettering, a red tomahawk and silver piping.\n\nUnlike the home uniforms, which are worn based on a schedule, the road uniforms are chosen on game day by the starting pitcher. However, they are also subject to [[Major League Baseball]] rules requiring the road team to wear uniforms that contrast with the uniforms worn by the home team. Due to this rule, the gray uniforms are worn when the home team chooses to wear navy blue, and sometimes when the home team chooses to wear black.\n\n==Logos==\n\nFrom 1945 to 1955 the Braves primary logo consisted of the head of an Indian warrior.<ref>{{cite news |title=Boston Braves Logos |url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/5933/Boston_Braves |website=SportsLogos.net |access-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619163245/http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/5933/Boston_Braves |url-status=live}}</ref> From 1956 to 1965 it was a laughing Indian with a mohawk and one feather in his hair.<ref>{{cite news |title=Milwaukee Braves Logos |url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/84/Milwaukee_Braves |website=SportsLogos.net |access-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619163430/http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/84/Milwaukee_Braves |url-status=live}}</ref> When the Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966, the \"Braves\" script was added underneath the laughing Indian.<ref name=alogo>{{cite news |title=Atlanta Braves Logos |url=http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/51/Atlanta_Braves |website=SportsLogos.net |access-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619163638/http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/51/Atlanta_Braves |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1985, the Braves made a small script change to the logo.<ref name=alogo /> The Braves modern logo debuted in 1987.<ref name=alogo /> The modern logo is the word \"Braves\" in cursive with a tomahawk below it.<ref name=alogo /> In 2018, the Braves made a subtle color change to the primary logo.<ref name=alogo />\n\n==Fanbase== \nIn addition to having strong fan support in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] and the state of Georgia, the Braves also boost heavy support within the [[Southeastern United States]] particularly in states such as [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[South Carolina]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Florida]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seatgeek.com/tba/articles/where-do-mlb-fans-live-mapping-baseball-fandom-across-the-u-s/#:~:text=Team%20with%20the%20most%20U.S.%20counties%3A%20Atlanta%20Braves&text=The%20Braves%20dominate%20the%20Southeastern,%2C%20North%20Carolina%2C%20and%20Florida.|title=Where do MLB Fans Live?

It should just cover the current radio and tv broadcast crew.|date=December 2022}}\nAfter years of stability, the Braves have faced a period of transition in their radio and television coverage.\n\nThe 2007 season was the last for Braves baseball on the [[TBS (TV network)|TBS Superstation]]. TBS showed 70 games throughout the country, then cleared the decks to make way for a [[Major League Baseball on TBS|new national broadcast package]] that began in earnest with the 2007 postseason, and expanded to Sunday afternoon games in 2008. Until his dismissal in 2009, [[Chip Caray]], one of the Braves' current broadcasters, called [[play-by-play]] for the national package, which includes the [[Division Series]] every season and alternating coverage of the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] and [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. Caray is joined by [[Joe Simpson (baseball)|Joe Simpson]], who has provided color commentary for the Braves since 1992.\n\nBraves baseball had been on TBS since it was WTCG in 1972 and had been a cornerstone of the national superstation since it began in 1976. [[WPCH-TV|WPCH-TV/Peachtree TV]], formerly WTBS Atlanta, still carried Braves games after 2007, but only in parts of the Southern United States. After the transfer of the channel's operations from Time Warner to [[Meredith Corporation]], all Peachtree TV games were simulcast on [[Fox Sports South]] outside of the Peachtree TV coverage area in 2011 and 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albanyherald.com/mlb/headlines/MLB_NOTEBOOK_FSN_reaches_agreement_with_Peachtree_TV_to_broadcast_45_Braves_games_in_2011_Ex-Braves_Jones_signs_with_Yanks_114343144.html |title=MLB NOTEBOOK: FSN reaches agreement with Peachtree TV to broadcast 45 Braves games in 2011; Ex-Braves Jones signs with Yanks |publisher=Albanyherald.com |access-date=July 25, 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> On February 27, 2013, it was announced that [[Fox Sports]] South and SportSouth (now called [[Bally Sports Southeast]]) would carry every regionally televised Braves game exclusively, ending the team's partnership with WPCH-TV after 40 years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tucker|first=Tim|title=Braves' TV deal changes; games move off Peachtree TV|url=https://www.ajc.com/sports/baseball/braves-deal-changes-games-move-off-peachtree/gEfp0iClAdxZnck3z3jNvK/|newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=March 1, 2013|access-date=April 19, 2018|archive-date=January 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115034321/http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/baseball/braves-tv-deal-changes-games-move-peachtree-tv/nWcNF/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ballysports.com/south/|title=South & Southeast|website=[[Bally Sports Southeast]]|access-date=September 18, 2022}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 2004 season, longtime radio flagship station [[WSB (AM)|750 WSB]] was replaced by [[WBIN (AM)|WGST]] 640AM. Due to WGST's weak signal at night, which fails to cover the entire [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], all games began to be simulcast on [[FM radio]] when the rights were transferred. The games first appeared on 96.1 [[WWPW|WKLS]] (formerly \"96 Rock\") in 2005, but moved to [[country music]] station 94.9 [[WUBL]] (\"94.9 The Bull\") in 2007 after WKLS underwent a change in format from [[classic rock]] to [[active rock]] and became [[WWPW|Project 9\u20136\u20131]]. In the 2009 season, the Braves returned to WKLS for FM broadcast and remained with WGST for AM. The Braves switched to [[WCNN]] 680 The Fan in Atlanta for AM coverage and [[WNNX]] 100.5 for FM in 2010.<ref>[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090302&content_id=3904480&vkey=pr_atl&fext=.jsp&c_id=atl \"Atlanta Braves and Clear Channel Announce Move to Project 9\u20136\u20131 for 2009 Games.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616125121/http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090302&content_id=3904480&vkey=pr_atl&fext=.jsp&c_id=atl |date=June 16, 2011}} March 2, 2009.
