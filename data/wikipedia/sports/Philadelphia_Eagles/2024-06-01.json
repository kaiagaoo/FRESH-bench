The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses. In keeping with its charter, which stated that \"all profits shall be donated to charity\", all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions. The original Frankford Athletic Association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Frankford Athletic Association's Yellow Jackets gained the reputation as being one of the best independent football teams in the nation. In 1922, Frankford absorbed the Philadelphia City Champion team, the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. That year, Frankford captured the unofficial championship of Philadelphia. During the 1922 and 1923 seasons, the Yellow Jackets compiled a 6\u20132\u20131 record against teams from the National Football League. This led to the Association being granted an NFL franchise in 1924, thus becoming the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]]. In spite of winning the NFL championship in 1926, midway through the [[1931 NFL season|1931 season]], the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations.<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 81\">Lyons, 2010 pg. 81</ref>\n\n=== Bell and Wray era (1933\u20131940) ===\n{{See also|Bert Bell|Lud Wray}}\n[[File:Grand Stand Entrance of Shibe Park.jpg|thumb|[[Shibe Park]], the Eagles' home field, which they shared with baseball's [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] in 1940 and then from 1942 to 1957]]\n[[File:Aerial view of Municipal Stadium, Philadelphia, Pa (65080) (cropped1).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Municipal Stadium]], the Eagles' home field from 1936 to 1939 and again in 1941]]\nAfter more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement for the Yellow Jackets in the lucrative Philadelphia market, the [[National Football League]] granted an expansion franchise to an ownership group headed by [[Bert Bell]] and [[Lud Wray]], who were also awarded the liquidated assets of the defunct Yellow Jackets organization. The Bell\u2013Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500, or roughly $67,000 USD in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars, and assumed a total debt of $11,000 the Yellow Jackets owed to three other NFL franchises.<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 82\">Lyons, 2010 pg. 82</ref> Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle logo of the [[National Recovery Administration]], a centerpiece of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] policies,<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 82\" /> Bell and Wray named their new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. While it could seem as if the Yellow Jackets simply rebranded as the Eagles, both the Eagles organization and NFL officially regard the teams as two separate entities. Not only was there no Philadelphia NFL team for a season and a half, but almost no players from the 1931 Yellow Jackets appeared on the Eagles' first roster.\n\nIn the [[1933 NFL season]], the Eagles were one of three teams, along with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the now defunct [[Cincinnati Reds (NFL)|Cincinnati Reds]], to join the NFL as [[expansion team]]s. Wray became the Eagles' first head coach after being persuaded to assume the position by Bell, his former teammate at [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]]. The Eagles originally intended to play their home games at Shibe Park, which was the home of the [[History of the Philadelphia Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] professional baseball in Philadelphia. When negotiations for use of Shibe Park fell through, however, the Eagles struck a deal with the Athletics' crosstown rival, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], to begin playing at the [[Baker Bowl]].\n\nThe Eagles played their first game on October 15, 1933, against the [[1933 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] at the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City]], and lost the game  56\u20130.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jt-sw.com/football/pro/results.nsf/Teams/1933-phi | title = 1933 Philadelphia Eagles | access-date = October 27, 2011 | last = Troan | first = John | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121015081415/http://www.jt-sw.com/football/pro/results.nsf/Teams/1933-phi | archive-date = October 15, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> The Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade, never winning more than four games in any of their first ten seasons. Their best finish was in [[1934 NFL season|1934]], the second season for the Eagles, when they tied for third in the East. The Eagles' early rosters largely consisted of former Penn, [[Temple Owls football|Temple]], and [[Villanova Wildcats football|Villanova]] players who played for the Eagles for a few years before going on to other things.\n\nIn [[1935 NFL season|1935]], Bell proposed an annual [[NFL Draft|college draft]] to equalize talent across the league. The draft was a revolutionary concept in professional sports. Having teams select players in inverse order of their finish in the standings, a practice still followed today, strove to increase fan interest by guaranteeing that even the worst teams would have the opportunity for annual infusions of the best college talent.<ref name=\"NFL Chronology p. 351\">{{cite web | url = http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Chronology_2011.pdf | title = Chronology of Professional Football | access-date = October 27, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121019060828/http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Chronology_2011.pdf | archive-date = October 19, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> Between [[1927 NFL season|1927]], when the NFL changed from a sprawling Midwestern-based association to a narrower, major-market league, and 1934, three teams, the [[Chicago Bears]], [[New York Giants]], and [[Green Bay Packers]], won all but one title with the exception of the [[Providence Steam Roller]], which won in 1928. By [[1936 NFL season|1936]], the Eagles suffered significant financial losses and were sold through a public auction. Bert Bell was the only bidder and became the sole owner of the team. Wray refused a reduction in his salary and left the team. Bell assumed the head coaching position and led the team to a record of 1\u201311, last place in the league.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1939, the Eagles played at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|Municipal Stadium]] in [[South Philadelphia]]. In 1940, Bell balked at a 66% rent increase plus 10% of the gate receipts proposed by the City of Philadelphia for use of Municipal Stadium and signed a lease for Shibe Park, which was renamed [[Connie Mack Stadium]] in 1954.

The team finished the 1943 season with a 5\u20134\u20131 record, and the merger, which was never intended to be a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the season's end.\n\nIn [[1944 Philadelphia Eagles season|1944]], the Eagles, led by head coach Greasy Neale and running back [[Steve Van Buren]], had their first winning season in team history. After two second-place finishes in [[1945 Philadelphia Eagles season|1945]] and [[1946 Philadelphia Eagles season|1946]], the team reached the [[1947 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship game]] for the first time in [[1947 Philadelphia Eagles season|1947]].

Because of the severe weather, few fans witnessed the joyous occasion.\n\nPrior to the start of the [[1949 NFL season|1949 season]], the Eagles were sold by Thompson to a syndicate of 100 buyers, known as the \"[[Happy Hundred]]\", each of whom paid $3,000 for a share of the team.

An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history.\n\nIn [[1950 Philadelphia Eagles season|1950]], the Eagles opened the season against the [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]] champion [[Cleveland Browns]], who, along with two other AAFC franchises, had just [[1950 NFL season#The AAFC\u2013NFL merger|joined the NFL]]. The Eagles were expected to make short work of the Browns, who were widely considered the dominant team in a lesser league. However, the Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards, including 246 passing yards, in a 35\u201310 rout. The Eagles never recovered from the loss, and finished the 1950 season 6\u20136.\n\nFollowing the 1950 season, Greasy Neale retired and was replaced by [[Bo McMillin]]. Two games into the [[1951 Philadelphia Eagles season|1951 season]], McMillin was forced to retire following a diagnosis of terminal [[stomach cancer]]. [[Wayne Millner]] finished out the season before being replaced by [[Jim Trimble]].\n\nWhile the remnants of the great 1940s teams managed to stay competitive for the first few years of the decade, and younger players like [[Bobby Walston]] and [[Sonny Jurgensen]] occasionally provided infusions of talent, the team lacked the total talent necessary for true greatness during most of the 1950s.\n\nAfter the [[1957 Philadelphia Eagles season|1957 season]], the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to [[Franklin Field]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Franklin Field had a vastly expanded seating capacity for the Eagles. While Connie Mack Stadium had a capacity of 39,000, Franklin Field's capacity was 60,000.<ref name=\"The Eagles Encyclopedia\">{{cite book |title=The Eagles Encyclopedia |last=Didinger |first=Ray |author2=Robert S.

During the [[1959 Philadelphia Eagles season|1959 season]], the team showed flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division. Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell had become [[National Football League Commissioner|NFL commissioner]], and attended the Eagles game on October 11 at Franklin Field against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], a team Bell used to own. Bell refused the box seats that the Eagles reserved for him and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans. During the fourth quarter, while sitting behind the end zone, Bell suffered a heart attack and died later that day.\n\n===== NFL champions (1960) =====\n{{Further|1960 NFL Championship Game|Philadelphia Eagles Santa Claus incident|The Hit (Chuck Bednarik)}}\n[[File:Penn - Franklin Field - 1922.jpg|thumb|[[Franklin Field]], the Eagles' home field from 1958 to 1970]]\nThe Eagles' [[1960 Philadelphia Eagles season|1960 season]] remains one of the most celebrated year in team history. Shaw, Van Brocklin, and [[Chuck Bednarik|Bednarik]], each in their last season before retirement, led an Eagles team more notable for its grit than its talent. One observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\" to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, wide receiver [[Tommy McDonald (American football)|Tommy McDonald]], who later wrote an  autobiography titled ''They Pay Me to Catch Footballs'', and tight end [[Pete Retzlaff]].\n\nOn November 20, 1960, at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in [[The Bronx]], Bednarik launched a tackle against [[New York Giants]]' running back [[Frank Gifford]], which has come to be known as [[The Hit (Chuck Bednarik)|The Hit]], a tackle that is routinely ranked as one of the hardest and most vicious hits in [[National Football League|NFL]] history. With the game tied 10 to 10 in the fourth quarter, Gifford caught a short pass over the middle and was immediately hit by Bednarik with a clothes line tackle so hard that it dropped Gifford to the ground unconscious. Gifford was removed from the field on stretcher and transported to a local hospital by ambulance, where he remained for ten days. Gifford was diagnosed with a deep [[concussion]] that resulted in his retirement from the game for 18 months.<ref>[https://www.sportscasting.com/the-facts-and-fiction-behind-chuck-bednariks-hit-on-wide-receiver-frank-gifford/ \"Facts and fiction behind Chuck Bednarik's hit on wide receiver Frank Gifford,\"] Sportscasting</ref> On the 100th anniversary of the NFL's founding, the NFL ranked Bednarik's tackle the 44th greatest play in league history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nfl.com/100/originals/100-greatest/plays-44 |title=NFL's 100 Greatest Plays \u2013 44: Chuck Bednarik hit on Frank Gifford |work=NFL.com |access-date=July 22, 2022}}</ref> \n\nOn December 26, 1960, one of the coldest days in recorded Philadelphia history, the Eagles faced [[Vince Lombardi]]'s [[Green Bay Packers]] in the [[1960 NFL Championship Game]] and dealt the formidable Lombardi the sole championship game loss of his storied career.

The off-field chaos continued through [[1963 Philadelphia Eagles season|1963]], as the 65 shareholders remaining from the original Happy Hundred sold the team to [[Jerry Wolman]], a 36-year-old millionaire Washington developer who outbid local bidders for the team, paying an unprecedented $5.505 million for control of the club.<ref name=\"ppegpff\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=asZaAAAAIBAJ&pg=6780%2C1063969 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |agency=Associated Press |title=Wolman purchases Eagles for $5.5 million |date=December 6, 1963 |page=33 |access-date=November 19, 2020 |archive-date=May 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503021743/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=asZaAAAAIBAJ&pg=6780%2C1063969 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"tbapegbt\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LgJPAAAAIBAJ&pg=5275%2C5584324 |work=Toledo Blade |location=(Ohio) |agency=Associated Press |title=Eagles bought for $5 miilion |date=December 6, 1963 |page=30 |access-date=November 19, 2020 |archive-date=May 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503021743/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LgJPAAAAIBAJ&pg=5275%2C5584324 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn [[1964 Philadelphia Eagles season|1964]], Wolman hired former Cardinals and [[Washington Redskins]] coach [[Joe Kuharich]] to a 15-year contract.

The team had only one winning season, in [[1966 Philadelphia Eagles season|1966]], finishing second in the [[Eastern and Western Conferences (NFL) 1933\u20131969|NFL Eastern Conference]]. The Eagles lost to the [[Baltimore Colts]] 20\u201314, in the post-season's third place consolation game, the [[Playoff Bowl]], which was held at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] in [[Miami]].

Williams and Khayat were hampered by Retzlaff's decision to trade longtime starting quarterback [[Norm Snead]] to the [[1971 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] in early 1971, leaving the Eagles a choice between journeyman [[Pete Liske]] and raw [[Rick Arrington]]. Khayat lost his first two games but won six of the season's last nine, thanks largely to the efforts of the Eagles' defense, led by all-pro safety [[Bill Bradley (American football)|Bill Bradley]], who led the NFL in interceptions (11) and interception return yardage (248).\n\nThe team regressed in [[1972 Philadelphia Eagles season|1972]] to finish 2\u201311\u20131, and Khayat was released. The two wins (both on the road) proved to be surprises, however. Philadelphia beat the [[1972 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] (which had had the best record in the AFC a year before) 21\u201320 and the [[1972 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] 18\u201317 on six field goals by kicker [[Tom Dempsey]]. The latter game had been called the \"Johnny Rodgers Bowl,\" because the loser, in finishing last in the league, would gain the first overall pick in the [[1973 NFL Draft]], which was then presumed to be [[1972 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] wingback [[Johnny Rodgers]], the [[Heisman Trophy]] [[1972 NCAA University Division football season#Heisman Trophy|winner]]. With their loss, the Oilers got first pick and took [[1972 Tampa Spartans football team|University of Tampa]] defensive end [[John Matuszak]], who later faced Philadelphia in [[Super Bowl XV]]. With the second overall pick, the Eagles selected [[1972 USC Trojans football team|USC]] tight end [[Charle Young]].\n\nKhayat was replaced by offensive guru [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]] for the [[1973 Philadelphia Eagles season|1973 season]]. Aided by the skills of quarterback [[Roman Gabriel]] and towering young wide receiver [[Harold Carmichael]], they managed to infuse a bit of vitality into a previously moribund offense.\n\nNew general manager [[Jim Murray (American football)|Jim Murray]] also began to add talent on the defensive side of the line, most notably through the addition of future Pro Bowl linebacker [[Bill Bergey]] in [[1974 Philadelphia Eagles season|1974]].

[[Jeffrey Lurie]] bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994, for an estimated $185&nbsp;million.

Rich Kotite was fired and replaced by [[San Francisco 49ers]] defensive coordinator [[Ray Rhodes]], who successfully lured 49ers star [[Ricky Watters]] to join the team as a free agent.\n\nIn [[1995 Philadelphia Eagles season|1995]], Rhodes's first season, the Eagles got off to a slow start by losing three of their first four games but subsequently rebounded to finish with a 10\u20136 record and a playoff spot. In the Wild Card Round, the Eagles, playing at home, overwhelmed the [[Detroit Lions]] 58\u201337, with 31 of Philadelphia's points coming in the second quarter. However, the Eagles were again eliminated in the next round by the Cowboys by a score of 30\u201311. This would be [[Randall Cunningham]]'s last game as an Eagle. Cunningham scored the only touchdown of the game and the last Eagles postseason touchdown for six years.\n\n1995 marked the end of Cunningham's tenure as starting quarterback. Rhodes benched Cunningham in favor of [[Rodney Peete]], leading to friction between the two. Earlier, rumors had circulated that Lurie and Rhodes had tried to trade Cunningham to the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. However, no such trade materialized and Cunningham retired shortly after the season.\n\nIn [[1996 Philadelphia Eagles season|1996]], the Eagles' uniform colors were changed from the classic [[kelly green]] to a darker [[midnight green]]. The team got off to a good start, winning three of their first four games. However, a week-5 Monday night game at [[Veterans Stadium]] against the rival [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] witnessed a season-ending knee injury to Peete, loss of the team's momentum, and the transition to an offense led by [[Ty Detmer]] and Watters. While Detmer played well and Watters rushed for 1,411 yards, the season conformed to what had become a familiar pattern: 10\u20136 record and early elimination (a 14\u20130 shutout by the [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]]) in the [[1996\u201397 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. In the [[1996 NFL draft]], future fan-favorite and hall-of-famer [[Brian Dawkins]] was chosen in the 2nd round. The continued early playoff exits led fans and local media to cast blame on high-priced free agents ([[Irving Fryar]], Watters, [[Troy Vincent]], and [[Guy McIntyre]]) for not stepping up in big games, especially in the postseason. Rhodes gradually deteriorated under the stress of the job, and players were beginning to grow tired of his brash demeanor and often autocratic coaching style.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/sports/pro-football-when-willpower-isn-t-enough-decline-of-ray-rhodes-s-eagles.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; When Willpower Isn't Enough: Decline of Ray Rhodes's Eagles|first=Mike|last=Freeman|newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 4, 1998|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215024205/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/sports/pro-football-when-willpower-isn-t-enough-decline-of-ray-rhodes-s-eagles.html|archive-date=February 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAfter a see-saw 6\u20139\u20131 campaign in [[1997 Philadelphia Eagles season|1997]], the bottom fell out in [[1998 Philadelphia Eagles season|1998]].

Reid's first notable step was drafting [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] with the second overall pick in the [[1999 NFL Draft]]. The Eagles' awful [[1998 Philadelphia Eagles season|1998 season]] would have entitled the Eagle to first pick but it was awarded to the rebooted [[Cleveland Browns]]. Despite clearing the roster for new talent by releasing unpopular and aging veterans such as [[Ricky Watters]] and [[Irving Fryar]], Reid was still a virtual unknown before his arrival as head coach, and his appointment was met initially with skepticism among Philadelphia fans. The drafting of McNabb was unpopular with many Eagles fans, many of whom traveled to [[Madison Square Garden]] for the 1999 Draft and booed the selection, believing the Eagles instead should have selected [[Ricky Williams]], a [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]] [[running back]] who had been named the 1998 [[Associated Press College Football Player of the Year|AP College Player of the Year]].\n\nThe [[1999 Philadelphia Eagles season|1999 season]] was largely a rebuilding year for the Eagles, who won only five games. The team, which routinely sells out its home games in Philadelphia, had two 1999 home games that failed to sell out, resulting in local [[Blackout (broadcasting)|TV blackouts]]. Another six home games in the 1999 season sold out only because several local small business owners bought the remaining unsold tickets to spare Philadelphia-area viewers a television blackout of the game. \n\nThe Week 5 home game at Veterans Stadium on October 10, 1999, against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] represented the last play of Cowboys wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]]'s career. In the game, Irvin was driven into the turf by Eagles safety [[Tim Hauck]], which left Irvin lying motionless. Some Eagles fans responded with applause, giving further rise to Philadelphia's reputation as unduly aggressive and hostile fans. Irvin was transported from the field by stretcher and then by ambulance to [[Thomas Jefferson University Hospital]]. Irvin, who was diagnosed with a potentially threatening [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical spine]] injury and forced to announce his NFL retirement after the injury, later said the Philadelphia fans were applauding his departure rather than his serious injury.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=David |title=Why Hall of Fame WR Michael Irvin has never criticized Philly fans for cheering career-ending injury |url=https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/cowboys/2013/10/19/why-hall-of-fame-wr-michael-irvin-has-never-criticized-philly-fans-for-cheering-career-ending-injury/ |access-date=October 15, 2021 |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=October 19, 2013}}</ref> The team finished the season with a record of 5\u201311.\n\nThe [[2000 Philadelphia Eagles season|2000]] regular-season opener in [[Dallas]] on September 3 became known in NFL lore as the \"[[Pickle Juice Game]]\". Kickoff temperature in [[Texas Stadium]] was 109 degrees Fahrenheit and soared to nearly 120, making it the hottest game in league history, beating a previous record set in a 1997 Cowboys\u2013Cardinals match in Arizona. The nickname came about because an Eagles trainer had prepared for the predicted heat by having the players drink the juice from jars of dill pickles in order to retain body moisture and stave off cramps and heat exhaustion. The experiment proved successful as the Eagles won 41\u201314 while multiple Cowboys players had been consigned to the bench, unable to handle the torrid climate while the Eagles had no players benched. The game was also significant as marking the beginning of Philadelphia's domination of the NFC East. The team finished the season at 11\u20135, reaching the [[2000\u201301 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] as a wild card, which restored fan optimism. After brushing aside the [[2000 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20133, the [[2000 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] moved to the second round of the playoffs, only to lose 20\u201310 to the [[2000 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. After compiling an 11\u20135 record in [[2001 Philadelphia Eagles season|2001]], the Eagles reached the [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] again, this time at the top of their division. In a near rerun of the previous year, they disposed of the [[2001 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Buccaneers]] in a 31\u20139 game. In the second round, the Eagles defeated the [[2001 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] 33\u201319 at [[Soldier Field]]. In the [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs#NFC: St. Louis Rams 29, Philadelphia Eagles 24|NFC Championship game]], they were unable to stop the [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], who defeated them 29\u201324.\n\nDespite injuries, McNabb led the Eagles to a 12\u20134 season in [[2002 Philadelphia Eagles season|2002]]. Once again, they reached the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs#NFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 27, Philadelphia Eagles 10|NFC Championship game]], but lost at home 27\u201310 to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the last game at [[Veterans Stadium]].\n\nIn the opening game of the [[2003 Philadelphia Eagles season|2003 season]], the Eagles were shut out 17\u20130 by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the first regular-season game ever played at their new home, [[Lincoln Financial Field]]. Once again, the team went 12\u20134 for the season and then reached the conference championship game. In doing so, the Eagles became the first team in modern history to get that far in the postseason after having been shut out at home in its first game. They achieved that distinction despite getting only five touchdown receptions all year by their wide receivers, which tied the league-low since the regular-season schedule was lengthened to its present 16 games in 1978 (this record would be broken in 2004 when the [[2004 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]' wide receivers caught only two touchdown passes). The Eagle receivers went through both September and October without a TD catch; the last time an NFL team had done that was in 1945. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the Eagles beat the [[2003 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 20\u201317 in overtime thanks in part to a late-game completion from McNabb to [[Freddie Mitchell]] on an iconic play that has come to be known as [[4th and 26]]. They lost the [[2003\u201304 NFL playoffs#NFC: Carolina Panthers 14, Philadelphia Eagles 3|NFC Championship game]] to the [[2003 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] 14\u20133.

Owens ended up with exactly 1,200 receiving yards and 14 touchdown receptions, although his season ended prematurely with an ankle injury in a December 19 game against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The Eagles' 12\u20137 victory in this game gave them home-field advantage throughout the conference playoffs for the third year in a row. The Eagles tied a record by clinching the NFC East division crown (their fourth straight) after only their eleventh game of the season, matching the mark set by the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]] and the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|1997 San Francisco 49ers]]. Their final two regular-season games thus rendered meaningless, the Eagles sat out most of their first-string players in these games and lost both, yet still finished the season with a 13\u20133 record. McNabb had his best season to date, passing for 3,875 yards and 31 touchdowns, with only eight interceptions. This made him the first quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 or more TD passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single regular season. They then began their playoff run with the Divisional round at home against the sixth-seeded [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The Eagles led from the start and never looked back, as McNabb led a very efficient passing attack (21 of 33 for 286 yards and 2 TDs), [[Brian Westbrook]] dominated on the ground with 70 rushing yards, and [[Freddie Mitchell]] performed very well on the receiving corps (5 receptions for 65 yards and a TD), as Philadelphia won 27\u201314, setting up their fourth-straight NFC Championship appearance. Facing the [[Atlanta Falcons]], McNabb threw for 180 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 32 yards. Westbrook rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 39. Winning the game 27\u201310, the Eagles advanced to [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], where they faced the [[2004 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14\u201314 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles with ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left sealed their fate, as the Patriots won 24\u201321.\n\nThe team took a step back in [[2005 Philadelphia Eagles season|2005]] with a 6\u201310 record, failing to make the playoffs for the first time since the 1999 season. McNabb had played with a sports hernia and a broken thumb, starting 4\u20132 then losing three in a row, before he finally succumbed to injury and missed the rest of the season. For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games and was eventually cut.\n\nIn [[2006 Philadelphia Eagles season|2006]], the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil. However, Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under coach Reid, with a 10\u20136 record. They won the Wild Card game against the [[New York Giants]], but lost in the Divisional Round to the [[New Orleans Saints]]. The [[2007 Philadelphia Eagles season|2007 season]] would end with the Eagles finishing 8\u20138 and failing to make the playoffs for the second time in three seasons.

Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles had thrown 19 touchdowns, just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by [[Peyton Manning]]. Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single game, with seven, against the [[2013 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]], which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw for that many touchdowns in a game.

He also finished with a 119.0 [[passer rating]], third-highest in league history behind only [[Aaron Rodgers]] in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004. He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect passer rating. [[LeSean McCoy]] finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL. As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in franchise history, passing the previous season-high set back in 1948.

The Patriots responded by advancing the ball to the Philadelphia 11-yard line on their next drive, which was set up by a 50-yard completion from Brady to [[Danny Amendola]], and the quarter ended.<ref name=\"PBP\">{{cite web|title=Super Bowl LII Play By Play|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2018020400/2017/POST22/eagles@patriots#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap3000000914297&tab=analyze&analyze=playbyplay|website=NFL.com|access-date=February 5, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204232931/http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2018020400/2017/POST22/eagles@patriots#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap3000000914297&tab=analyze&analyze=playbyplay|archive-date=February 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the second quarter, Philadelphia faced fourth-and-goal on the 1-yard line with 38 seconds left. Deciding to go for the touchdown, they attempted a trick play similar to one that had failed for the Patriots earlier. It would be the most memorable play of the game. As Foles stepped up to the running back position, Clement took a direct snap and pitched the ball to tight end [[Trey Burton]], who then threw the ball to Foles, who was wide open in the right side of the end zone. Foles caught the ball, making him the first quarterback ever to catch a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, and the ensuing extra point was good, giving the Eagles a 22\u201312 lead, which was taken into the locker room after a short drive by the Patriots. The scoring play came to be known as the [[Philly Special]].<ref name=\"PBP\" /> New England's only lead was by one point in the fourth quarter, 33\u201332, but the Eagles rallied back and scored an 11-yard touchdown to tight end [[Zach Ertz]] to take the lead. The last score of the game was a 46-yard field goal by [[Jake Elliott]] to make the final score 41\u201333.\n\nThe Eagles won their first Super Bowl and [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] in franchise history and their first championship since 1960, ending the third-longest active championship drought in the NFL at 57 years. Foles won [[Super Bowl MVP]] going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown. Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for [[Drew Bledsoe]] in 2002's [[Super Bowl XXXVI]].\n\nThe combined 74 points scored was one point shy of the Super Bowl record of 75, set in [[Super Bowl XXIX]] in 1995; this game marked only the second time in the history of the Super Bowl where the teams combined for 70+ points.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stites|first=Adam|title=The Patriots and Eagles gave us the 2nd highest-scoring Super Bowl ever|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2018/2/4/16972266/super-bowl-history-highest-scoring-record-eagles-patriots|website=SB Nation|date=February 5, 2018|access-date=February 6, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206131539/https://www.sbnation.com/2018/2/4/16972266/super-bowl-history-highest-scoring-record-eagles-patriots|archive-date=February 6, 2018}}</ref> The game also set a record for most yardage by both teams (combined) with 1,151 yards, the most for any single game, regular season or postseason.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Michael David |title=Eagles, Patriots combine for most yards in any NFL game, ever |url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/02/04/eagles-patriots-combine-for-most-yards-in-any-nfl-game-ever/ |work=ProFootballTalk |publisher=NBC Sports |date=February 5, 2018 |access-date=January 26, 2021 |archive-date=January 31, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210131143311/https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/02/04/eagles-patriots-combine-for-most-yards-in-any-nfl-game-ever/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe game set many other Super Bowl records as well, including fewest punts from both teams (one), and most yards gained by a team (613 for New England).<ref>{{cite web |title=High-flying offenses lead to host of SB records |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/22326259/records-abound-high-scoring-super-bowl-lii |website=ESPN.com |language=en |date=February 5, 2018 |access-date=January 26, 2021 |archive-date=January 31, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210131174847/https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/22326259/records-abound-high-scoring-super-bowl-lii |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[2018 Philadelphia Eagles season|2018 season]] started, many injuries plagued the team, including quarterback Carson Wentz, who was still recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury that he had sustained during the previous season.

In 1954 the Eagles, along with the [[Baltimore Colts]], became the second team ever in the NFL to put a [[Logo#Sports|logo]] on their [[football helmet|helmets]], with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969 the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings within a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from 1969 to 1972, the eagle took on a more stylized look.\n\nIn 1973, the team's name was added below the eagle, returning to its pre-1969 look. Both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996, when the primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described as \"midnight green.\" Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo combination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed, with the eagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic, more cartoon-like style, and the lettering changed from calligraphic to block letters.<ref>{{cite news|last=Spadaro|first=Dave|title=Is kelly green on the horizon for the Eagles?|url=https://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/is-kelly-green-on-the-horizon-for-the-eagles|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=PhiladelphiaEagles.com|date=March 26, 2019|access-date=May 30, 2020|archive-date=September 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928151426/https://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/is-kelly-green-on-the-horizon-for-the-eagles|url-status=live}}</ref> The eagle head is the only NFL logo to \u201cface left\u201d which causes the right side of the logo to present a stylized \u201cE\u201d.\n\nSince 1996, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly related to jersey/pants combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at [[Veterans Stadium]], a win over the division-rival [[2002 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses, to the [[2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[2003 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. After that, the white jerseys along with white pants were worn exclusively during preseason games from 2004 to 2011, with the exception of 2007 and 2010.\n\nThe 2003 season also saw the first (though subtle) change to the 1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight green pants. The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected [[home (sports)|home]] games each season (usually the first home game after a [[bye (sports)|bye]] week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular-season home finales, the team wore the green [[road (sports)|road]] pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost both games. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th-anniversary uniforms serving as the \"alternates\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules at the time (alternate uniforms were permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving]] night game against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]]. From 2006 to 2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011. For the 2007 and 2010 seasons, the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams. The team also started wearing black cleats exclusively in 2004, although the rule was relaxed by the mid-2010s.\n\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore [[throwback uniform|\"throwback\" jerseys]] in a 2007 game against the [[2007 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on [[flag of Philadelphia|Philadelphia's city flag]], are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and had been the same colors used by the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]] franchise prior to its suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56\u201321.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12323 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724212544/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12323 |archive-date=July 24, 2010 |title=Eagles Unveil 75th Anniversary Plans |publisher=Philadelphia Eagles |date=April 25, 2007 |access-date=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games and daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to mid-October when the temperature is warmer. In night contests in the first half of the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in November, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they had done it earlier), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey. On one occasion, the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] on November 4, 2007, in order to make the Cowboys wear their blue road jerseys. Upon moving to [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in 2003, the Eagles wore white at home for at least their home opener, but in recent years they opted to wear their standard midnight green jerseys even during the warmest of autumn weather.\n\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csnphilly.com/05/03/10/Eagles-Announce-Plans-to-Honor-1960-Titl/landing.html?blockID=227998&feedID=704 |title=Eagles Announce Plans to Honor 1960 Title Team |website=Csnphilly.com |date=May 3, 2010 |access-date=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120730121316/http://www.csnphilly.com/05/03/10/Eagles-Announce-Plans-to-Honor-1960-Titl/landing.html?blockID=227998&feedID=704 |archive-date=July 30, 2012}}</ref> In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games.\n\nFor the 2012 season, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over from [[Reebok]] as the NFL's official apparel licensee, but the Eagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike's \"Elite 51\" uniform technology. Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo, the only other change is the league-wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform (replacing the NFL Equipment logo). Other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged. The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey and resumed wearing white pants with their white jerseys in the regular season.\n\nFor the 2014 season, the Eagles officially adopted the \"Elite 51\u2033 style uniform from Nike. However, they only broke out the midnight green jerseys and pants in the second half of that season due to the difficulty of producing their preferred shade of midnight green.\n\nRecently the team has discussed bringing back the \"Kelly Green\" uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship season, which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs. Green Bay. Traditionally, kelly green, silver and white had been the official team colors, until the 1996 season when it changed to the current \"Midnight Green\" uniforms. NFL rules and restrictions require that teams go through a waiting period before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made, which means it would likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made.\n\nIn Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set. The Eagles won the game 27\u20130. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. In Week 16 of 2016 (also against the Giants), the Eagles wore a variation of the all-black look as part of the [[NFL Color Rush]] program, but with solid black socks as opposed to black with white sanitary socks of the original look. The black jerseys/white pants combination was last seen during a preseason road game against the [[2014 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], after which the black jerseys were paired exclusively with the black pants.\n\nIn 2018, the Eagles' midnight green pants were not worn at all, marking the first such instance since the 1996 rebrand that the Eagles wore only white pants with their primary white or midnight green jerseys.\n\nIn Week 6 of the 2017 season, the Eagles debuted an all-white look with white jerseys, white pants and solid white socks in a road game against the [[2017 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. The all-white look began to be utilized full-time as a road uniform set in 2019 thanks to the NFL's decision to allow teams to wear solid color socks as an alternate look.\n\nDuring Week 10 of the 2021 season, the Eagles paired their white uniforms with the alternate black pants against the [[2021 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], marking the first time the black pants were paired with a different colored uniform.\n\nIn 2022, the Eagles unveiled a new black alternate helmet, which would be worn alongside the all-black uniform. In addition, the team announced that throwback Kelly Green uniforms would return as an alternate uniform starting in the 2023 season.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 30, 2022 |title=Eagles to bring back Kelly green alternate uniforms in 2023.\n|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33625814/philadelphia-eagles-announce-return-kelly-green-alternate-uniforms-2023-nfl-season |access-date=April 25, 2022 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref> The team originally intended to release the uniforms in 2022, but due to production supply issues, the Eagles elected to delay its release to 2023. With the Kelly Green helmet becoming the team's alternate, the black helmet was shelved, and the Eagles returned to wearing their primary midnight green helmets with the all-black uniform.\n\nOn June 16, it was released to the media that the Eagles would be changing their wordmark to a more modernized design. The new wordmark would replace the old design immediately however would not be placed on the Team's Jerseys until the 2024 season.\n\n==Rivalries==\n===Divisional===\n====Dallas Cowboys====\n{{Main|Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry}}\n{{See also|Bounty Bowl}}\nThe Eagles and [[Dallas Cowboys]] rivalry has been listed among the best and most acrimonious in the NFL.<ref>{{cite web |last1=DeArdo |first1=Bryan |title=NFL's top 10 divisional rivalries: Cowboys-Eagles, Packers-Bears battle for top spot on all-time list |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfls-top-10-divisional-rivalries-cowboys-eagles-packers-bears-battle-for-top-spot-on-all-time-list/ |website=NFL.com |date=June 16, 2020 |access-date=July 13, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Whalon |first1=Bob |title=Philadelphia Eagles Rivalry: The Dallas Cowboys |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/Philadelphia-Eagles-Rivalry-The-Dallas-Cowboys |access-date=July 13, 2021 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=November 5, 2020}}</ref> The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27\u201325 on September 30, 1960.

From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Baltimore Colts]]) moved to the [[American Football Conference]], while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the [[National Football Conference]]. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35\u201313. The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the [[Super Bowl]] era.
