The Dolphins compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC East|East]] division. The team plays its home games at [[Hard Rock Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]], a northern suburb of [[Miami]]. The team is owned by [[Stephen M. Ross]]. The Dolphins are the oldest professional sports team in Florida. Of the four AFC East teams, the Dolphins are the only team in the division that was not a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL). The Dolphins were also one of the first professional football teams in the [[Southeastern United States|southeast]], along with the [[Atlanta Falcons]].\n\nThe Dolphins were founded by [[Joe Robbie]], an attorney and politician, and [[Danny Thomas]], an actor and comedian. They began play in the AFL in [[1966 Miami Dolphins season|1966]]. The region had not had a professional football team since the days of the [[Miami Seahawks]], who played in the [[All-America Football Conference]] in 1946, before becoming the first incarnation of the [[Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350)|Baltimore Colts]]. For the first few years, the Dolphins' full-time training camp and practice facilities were at [[Saint Andrew's School (Boca Raton, Florida)|Saint Andrew's School]], a private, boys boarding prep school in Boca Raton. Miami joined the NFL as a result of the 1970 [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]].\n\nThe team played in its first [[Super Bowl]] in [[Super Bowl VI]], losing to the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 24\u20133. [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|The following year]], the Dolphins completed the NFL's only [[perfect season]], culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 of their regular-season games, and all three of their playoff games, including [[Super Bowl VII]]. They were the third NFL team to accomplish a perfect [[National Football League regular season|regular season]], and remain the only team to do so including playoffs since the AFL-NFL merger, the time known as the Super Bowl era. The next year, the Dolphins won [[Super Bowl VIII]], becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, and the second team (the first AFL/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in [[Super Bowl XVII]] and [[Super Bowl XIX]], losing both games.\n\nFor most of their early history, the Dolphins were coached by [[Don Shula]], the most successful head coach in professional football history in terms of total games won. Under Shula, the Dolphins posted losing records in only two of his 26 seasons as the head coach. During the period spanning 1983 to the end of 1999, quarterback [[Dan Marino]] became one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. Marino led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances, and an appearance in Super Bowl XIX before retiring following the [[1999 Miami Dolphins season|1999 season]].\n\nSince Marino's retirement, they have experienced mediocre levels of success and have just six playoff appearances ([[2000\u201301 NFL playoffs|2000]], [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|2001]], [[2008\u201309 NFL playoffs|2008]], [[2016\u201317 NFL playoffs|2016]], [[2022 NFL season|2022]], and [[2023 Miami Dolphins season|2023]]) and two division titles ([[2000 Miami Dolphins season|2000]] and [[2008 Miami Dolphins season|2008]]) with one playoff win. They currently have the longest postseason win drought in the NFL.\n\nIn December 2024 the Dolphins, led by owner Stephen M. Ross, became one of the first teams in NFL history to sell part of their team to outside private equity investors. 13% of the Dolphins franchise was sold at a valuation of $8.1 billion, including 10% to the American investment group [[Ares Management|Ares Management.]]<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reed |first=Tashan |last2=Graham |first2=Tim |title=Dolphins, Bills sell stakes in team to private equity firms for first time in NFL history |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5986921/2024/12/11/dolphins-bills-team-stakes-sold/ |access-date=2024-12-12 |work=The New York Times |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Miami Dolphins|List of Miami Dolphins seasons}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 33 - Jim Kiick (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Dolphins finished their perfect [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 season]] by defeating the Redskins in [[Super Bowl VII]].]]\n\nThe Miami Dolphins joined the [[American Football League]] (AFL) when an expansion franchise was awarded to lawyer [[Joseph Robbie]] and actor [[Danny Thomas]] in 1965 for $7.5 million, although Thomas would eventually sell his stake in the team to Robbie.<ref name=\"nd650721\">{{Cite news |date=July 21, 1965 |title=Football League Trying Dixie Expansion |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XEMrAAAAIBAJ&pg=2822,3612744&dq=dixie+football-league&hl=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428032650/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XEMrAAAAIBAJ&pg=2822%2C3612744&dq=dixie+football-league&hl=en |archive-date=April 28, 2021 |access-date=May 15, 2010 |work=[[The Nevada Daily Mail]] |page=10 |agency=Associated Press|via=Google News}}</ref> During the summer of 1966, the Dolphins' training camp was in [[St. Pete Beach]] with practices in August at [[Boca Ciega High School]] in [[Gulfport, Florida|Gulfport]].<ref>Armistead, Tom \"On the Departing Dolphins: Observations and Conclusions\" (August 4, 1966), ''Evening Independent''</ref>\n\n===Don Shula===\nThe Dolphins were the worst team with a 15\u201339\u20132 record in their first four seasons under head coach [[George Wilson (football coach)|George Wilson]], before [[Don Shula]] was hired as head coach.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1966 AFL Standings & Team Stats |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1966_AFL/index.htm |access-date=2024-07-31 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=1967 Miami Dolphins Rosters, Stats, Schedule, Team Draftees |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/mia/1967.htm |access-date=2024-07-31 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=1968 Miami Dolphins Rosters, Stats, Schedule, Team Draftees |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/mia/1968.htm |access-date=2024-07-31 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=1969 Miami Dolphins Rosters, Stats, Schedule, Team Draftees |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/mia/1969.htm |access-date=2024-07-31 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=George Wilson Record, Statistics, and Category Ranks |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/WilsGe0.htm |access-date=2024-07-31 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"q720\">{{cite web | last=Poupart | first=Alain | title=30 Years Ago: When Shula Became NFL's Winningest Coach | website=Sports Illustrated Miami Dolphins News, Analysis and More | date=2023-11-14 | url=https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/miami-dolphins-30-year-anniversary-don-shula-becomes-the-winningest-coach | access-date=2024-07-31}}</ref> Shula was a [[Paul Brown]] disciple who had been lured from the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]], after losing [[Super Bowl III]] two seasons earlier to the AFL's [[New York Jets]], and finishing 8\u20135\u20131 the following season.<ref name=\"c172\">{{cite web | last=O'Connor | first=Ian | title=Don Shula's greatest victory was overcoming his most devastating defeat | website=ESPN.com | date=2020-05-04 | url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29133010/don-shula-greatest-victory-was-overcoming-most-devastating-defeat | access-date=2024-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=1969 Baltimore Colts Rosters, Stats, Schedule, Team Draftees |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/clt/1969.htm |access-date=2024-07-31 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref> Shula got his first NFL coaching job from then-Detroit head coach George Wilson, who hired him as the defensive coordinator.

The rivalry was extremely lopsided in favor of Miami during the 1970s, as the Dolphins won all 20 games against the Bills during that decade. Fortunes changed in the 1980s and 1990s when [[Jim Kelly]] became the Bills' starting quarterback. Though both teams were extremely dominant during that period, the Bills ultimately held the edge and dominated the Dolphins during their four playoff matchups in the 1990s, with the Dolphins' only playoff win coming after Kelly's retirement. With the rise of Tom Brady and the Patriots during the 2000s and the retirements of Kelly and Dolphins quarterback [[Dan Marino]], the Bills-Dolphins rivalry faded in relevance, but remains somewhat intense to this day. Some former Dolphins have gone to play for the Bills as well, most notably [[Dan Carpenter]], [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]], and [[Charles Clay (American football)|Charles Clay]].\n\nIn the 2020s, the rivalry sharpened, with Dolphins quarterback [[Tua Tagovailoa]], drafted in 2020, leading a resurgent Dolphins team against the [[Josh Allen]]-led Bills, who had gained a streak of success after Brady's departure from the Patriots and the division. Though Allen's career record against Miami currently stands at 11\u20132, Tagovailoa led the Dolphins to their first win over Bills in 8 games in 2022, and the Dolphins played the Bills tightly in the teams' two other meetings that year despite losing both, including the playoffs. As of the 2023 season, the Dolphins lead the all-time series 62\u201358\u20131.<ref>{{Cite web |title=All Matchups, Miami Dolphins vs. Buffalo Bills |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=mia&tm2=buf&yr=all |access-date=2024-08-06 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== New York Jets ====\n{{main|Dolphins\u2013Jets rivalry}}\nThe [[New York Jets]] are perhaps Miami's most bitter rivals.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yousefi |first=Ryan |date=September 14, 2018 |title=The New York Jets Will Forever Be South Florida's Most Hated Rival |url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/dolphins-jets-is-still-the-best-rivalry-in-south-florida-sports-10721666 |access-date=October 21, 2022 |work=Miami New Times |language=en}}</ref> Dolphins fans despise the Jets due to the sheer amount of New York City transplants who have moved to South Florida and the Jets' misplaced cocky demeanor. Just as the Bills-Dolphins rivalry is motivated by differences, the Dolphins-Jets series is also notable for the differences between New York and Miami.

Some of the more memorable moments in this rivalry include [[Dan Marino]]'s [[Clock Play|fake spike]], [[Vinny Testaverde]] leading the Jets to a [[Monday Night Miracle (American football)|notable comeback on Monday Night Football]], and former Jets quarterback [[Chad Pennington]] signing with the Dolphins and leading them to a divisional title.

The team's colors were originally [[Aqua (color)|aqua]] and [[coral (color)|coral]], with the coral color paying tribute to the Miami Seahawks and to the many natural coral reefs in Biscayne Bay. The team's original logo consisted of a sunburst with a leaping dolphin wearing a football helmet bearing the letter M. At their debut in 1966, a lighter & brighter orange was used instead of the deep coral color. The dolphin's head was near the center of the sunburst. In the 1967 season, the dolphin was centered on the sunburst, but it reverted to the original placement between 1968 and 1973. By 1974, the dolphin's body was centered on the sunburst in a slightly smaller logo than the 1967 version. The uniforms featured white pants with aqua and orange stripes, paired with either a white or aqua jersey. On the white jersey, aqua block numbers and names were outlined in orange, with aqua and orange sleeve stripes. Starting with the 1972 perfect season, these uniforms were used as the primary uniforms for road games and daytime home games, due to the extreme heat of South Florida. The team also had an aqua jersey used mainly for night home games or road games in which the opponent chose to wear white. The aqua jersey featured white block numbers and names with an orange outline, and orange and white sleeve stripes.\n\nAn update was given to the logo in 1997 \u2013 the sunburst was simplified and the dolphin was darkened and given a more serious game-face expression.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Highlights |url=http://www.miamidolphins.com/history/historicalhighlights/historicalhighlights12.asp |publisher=Miami Dolphins |date=June 3, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020604213955/http://miamidolphins.com/history/historicalhighlights/historicalhighlights12.asp |archive-date=June 4, 2002 |access-date=November 25, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The uniforms remained the same; however, a different block number font was used and navy drop shadows were added.\n\nOn very rare occasions, an orange jersey was used for primetime games. The uniforms essentially swapped the location of orange and aqua from the aqua jersey. The orange jersey was first used on a Sunday night in 2003 against [[Washington Redskins|Washington]], a Dolphin win. In 2004, the orange jersey was brought back for an ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' match pitting the 2\u201311 Dolphins against the 12\u20131 defending champion [[New England Patriots]]. The Dolphins scored a huge upset win after trailing by 11 points with less than 5 minutes remaining. Due to the unusual orange jerseys, the game has become known within some Dolphin circles as \"[[2004 New England Patriots season#Week 15: at Miami Dolphins|The Night That Courage Wore Orange]]\".<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/riFY4A6wXIU Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20141105105832/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riFY4A6wXIU&feature=player_embedded Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite AV media|people=rebellionmx|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riFY4A6wXIU|date=October 12, 2009|title=The Night Courage Wore Orange.

However, the Dolphins would lose a 2010 Sunday night matchup with the Jets, their first loss in orange, and the orange jerseys in the original style would not be worn again.\n\nIn 2009, the Dolphins switched to black shoes for the first time since the early 1970s glory days, following a recent trend among NFL teams. However, by 2011, they returned to wearing white shoes.\n\nThe Dolphins' final game in the original style uniforms with block numbers and the iconic leaping dolphin logo was the final game of the 2012 season, a 28\u20130 shutout loss to the New England Patriots in [[Gillette Stadium|Foxboro]]. The white jerseys were worn for the game, and as rumors of a new look had been swirling, many fans watching knew that it would likely be the last time their team would wear the leaping dolphin logo.\n\n====Stylized swimming dolphin (2013\u2013present)====\nA new logo and new uniforms were unveiled shortly before the [[2013 NFL draft]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sessler|first=Marc|title=Miami Dolphins confirm they have new logo|url=https://www.nfl.com/news/miami-dolphins-confirm-they-have-new-logo-0ap1000000154510|publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com|date=March 27, 2013|access-date=March 27, 2013|archive-date=March 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329083937/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000154510/article/miami-dolphins-confirm-they-have-new-logo|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Pugh|first=Jesse|title=Dee Confirms Logo Evolution|url=http://assets.dolphinsdigital.com/blog/2013/dee-confirms-logo-evolution?_ga=1.187286123.2147278759.1470620679|publisher=The Finsiders|date=March 29, 2013|access-date=March 29, 2013|archive-date=August 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821101412/http://assets.dolphinsdigital.com/blog/2013/dee-confirms-logo-evolution?_ga=1.187286123.2147278759.1470620679|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Florio |first=Mike  |author-link=Mike Florio |date=2013-03-27 |title=Dolphins confirm new logo |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/dolphins-confirm-new-logo |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330061805/http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/03/27/dolphins-confirm-new-logo/ |archive-date=March 30, 2013 |access-date=2024-07-31 |website=NBC Sports |language=en-US}}</ref> The new logo features a stylized [[aqua (color)|aqua]] dolphin swimming in front of a heavily modified version of the orange sunburst. The dolphin in the logo is more vague and artistic, and is not wearing a helmet as it is merely a silhouette of a dolphin cast in aqua and navy.\n\nNavy was incorporated as featured color for the first time, with orange becoming greatly de-emphasized. The uniforms feature both white pants and aqua pants, with a white or aqua jersey. The Dolphins continue to wear white at home, just as they had with the previous uniforms, with aqua being used for primetime home games. The white jersey features aqua numbers and names in a unique custom font, with orange and navy outlines on the numbers; however, the names only use navy as an outline color. The aqua jerseys use white numbers with an orange and aqua outline, and white names with a navy outline. The helmets are white with a white facemask, just like the final years of the previous look; however, navy is a prominent color on the helmet stripe, joining aqua and a de-emphasized orange. Both jerseys have large \"Dolphins\" text above the numbers, written in the team's new script. The pants are either aqua or white, and contain no markings other than a small team wordmark.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kent|first=Andy|title=Marino: New Logo Is About Tradition|url=http://www.miamidolphins.com/news/article-1/Marino-New-Logo-Is-About-Tradition/833326b3-201f-4a3d-b0f0-533f362082eb|publisher=Miami Dolphins|website=MiamiDolphins.com|date=April 25, 2013|access-date=November 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609041118/http://www.miamidolphins.com/news/article-1/Marino-New-Logo-Is-About-Tradition/833326b3-201f-4a3d-b0f0-533f362082eb|archive-date=June 9, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the team made some slight modifications to the logo and uniform set: The shades of orange and aqua were tweaked, and navy blue was removed from the color scheme, only remaining on the logo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article209324319.html |title=Miami Dolphins tweak their uniforms |last=Salguero |first=Armando |newspaper=Miami Herald |date=April 19, 2018 |access-date=April 21, 2018 |archive-date=April 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422042212/http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article209324319.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Throwback uniforms====\nIn 2015, the Dolphins brought back their 1970s aqua uniforms for a few select games. Four years later, they brought back a white version from the same era as a second alternate uniform. The aqua throwbacks were worn during the now-famous 2018 [[Miracle in Miami]] play against the Patriots.\n\n====Color Rush uniform====\nOn September 29, 2016, the Dolphins debuted their new [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform in a [[Thursday Night Football]] game against the [[2016 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]]. The all-orange uniform marked the first time since 2010 that the Dolphins wore an orange uniform. However, the set was only used for that game as the Dolphins immediately retired the uniform soon after.\n\nIn later years, the Dolphins wore similar all-aqua or all-white uniforms in select games as the NFL gradually relaxed its rules regarding hosiery.\n\n===Fight song===\nThe song was written and composed by Lee Ofman, and has similar instrumentation and lyrics to the fight song of the [[Houston Oilers]]. Ofman approached the Dolphins with it before the 1972 season because he wanted music to inspire his favorite team. The fight song would soon serve as a good luck charm for the Dolphins that season. The Dolphins became the first team in NFL history to record an undefeated season, going 17\u20130 en route to victory over the Washington Redskins in [[Super Bowl VII]]. The following season, Miami posted an equally impressive 15\u20132 record and capped the season with another title, defeating the Minnesota Vikings in [[Super Bowl VIII]]. The back-to-back championship runs, coupled with the popularity of the fight song amongst Dolphins fans, have ensured the song's longevity. The Dolphins revealed a new fight song by [[T-Pain]] and [[Jimmy Buffett]] featuring [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] on August 7, 2009, which was introduced for the 2009 NFL season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wright |first1=Todd |title=Dolphins Become Death of Autotune |url=https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/sports/Dolphins-Fight-Song-Goes-Autotune-52679517.html |website=NBC 6 South Florida |access-date=November 28, 2019 |date=August 7, 2009 |archive-date=November 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128101837/https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/sports/Dolphins-Fight-Song-Goes-Autotune-52679517.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The fight song was played during the preseason home opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2009, but was not played during the second preseason game against the Carolina Panthers on August 22, 2009, after being booed heavily in the first game. Furthermore, the team has preferred to play Buffett's song \"[[Fins (song)|Fins]]\" after scores during the 2009 regular season instead of the traditional fight song.\n\n===Cheerleaders===\n{{main|Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders}}\n[[File:Dolphins Cheerleaders - USS Vella Gulf - Jan 21 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders]]\nThe team's [[cheerleader]]s are known collectively as the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolphins Cheerleaders|url=https://www.miamidolphins.com/cheerleaders/|publisher=Miami Dolphins|website=MiamiDolphins.com|access-date=May 10, 2020|archive-date=April 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200424010134/https://www.miamidolphins.com/cheerleaders/|url-status=live}}</ref> The company had its debut in 1978 as the Dolphins Starbrites.

Special Teams is a unique volunteer organization created to enlist and mobilize the ongoing services of the community with the Dolphins staff, players and alumni. The mission of the Special Teams is to offer hands-on services to communities and families in need, to partner with existing organizations on worthwhile social, civic and charitable programs, to provide assistance at Miami Dolphins Foundation events, and to support community efforts in times of emergency. This program is headed by Leslie Nixon and Sergio Xiques.

Each of these players is honored with a placard on the facing of the upper level around Hard Rock Stadium including team founder-owner Joe Robbie. In place of a jersey number, Don Shula has the number 347, representing his record number of NFL coaching victories, 274 of them as Dolphins head coach. Dan Marino's name includes his career passing statistics of attempts (8,358), completions (4,967), passing yards (61,361), and touchdown passes (420). [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] inductees are additionally denoted by a hall of fame logo next to their names.\n\nIn 1992, at the 20-year anniversary, Miami's \"1972 Undefeated Team\" was enshrined into the Honor Roll. At the 40 year anniversary, which enshrined former defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger into the Honor Roll, his name went on the Honor Roll where the \"1972 Undefeated Team\" inductee previously and originally was enshrined, and an updated \"1972 Perfect Season Team 17\u20130\" inductee was put into one corner of Hard Rock Stadium with special placards of Super Bowl VII and Super Bowl VIII
