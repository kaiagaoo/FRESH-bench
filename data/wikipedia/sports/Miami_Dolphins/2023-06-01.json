The Dolphins compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC East|East]] division. The team plays its home games at [[Hard Rock Stadium]], located in the northern suburb of [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]. The team is currently owned by [[Stephen M. Ross]]. The Dolphins are the oldest professional sports team in Florida. Of the four AFC East teams, the Dolphins are the only team in the division that was not a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL). The Dolphins were also one of the first professional football teams in the southeast, along with the [[Atlanta Falcons]].\n\nThe Dolphins were founded by attorney-politician [[Joe Robbie]] and actor-comedian [[Danny Thomas]]. They began play in the AFL in [[1966 Miami Dolphins season|1966]]. The region had not had a professional football team since the days of the [[Miami Seahawks]], who played in the [[All-America Football Conference]] in 1946, before becoming the first incarnation of the [[Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350)|Baltimore Colts]]. For the first few years, the Dolphins' full-time training camp and practice facilities were at [[Saint Andrew's School (Boca Raton, Florida)|Saint Andrew's School]], a private, boys boarding prep school in Boca Raton. Miami joined the NFL as a result of the 1970 [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]].\n\nThe team played in its first [[Super Bowl]] in [[Super Bowl VI]], losing to the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 24\u20133. [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|The following year]], the Dolphins completed the NFL's only [[perfect season]], culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 of their regular-season games, and all three of their playoff games, including [[Super Bowl VII]]. They were the third NFL team to accomplish a perfect [[National Football League regular season|regular season]], and remain the only team to do so since the AFL-NFL merger, the time known as the Super Bowl era. The next year, the Dolphins won [[Super Bowl VIII]], becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, and the second team (the first AFL/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in [[Super Bowl XVII]] and [[Super Bowl XIX]], losing both games.\n\nFor most of their early history, the Dolphins were coached by [[Don Shula]], the most successful head coach in professional football history in terms of total games won. Under Shula, the Dolphins posted losing records in only two of his 26 seasons as the head coach. During the period spanning 1983 to the end of 1999, quarterback [[Dan Marino]] became one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. Marino led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances, and an appearance in Super Bowl XIX before retiring following the [[1999 Miami Dolphins season|1999 season]].\n\nSince Marino's retirement, they have experienced mediocre levels of success and have just five playoff appearances ([[2000\u201301 NFL playoffs|2000]], [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|2001]], [[2008\u201309 NFL playoffs|2008]], [[2016\u201317 NFL playoffs|2016]], and [[2022 NFL season|2022]]) and two division titles ([[2000 Miami Dolphins season|2000]] and [[2008 Miami Dolphins season|2008]]).\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{main|History of the Miami Dolphins|List of Miami Dolphins seasons}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 33 - Jim Kiick (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Dolphins finished their perfect [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 season]] by defeating the Redskins in [[Super Bowl VII]].]]\n\nThe Miami Dolphins joined the [[American Football League]] (AFL) when an expansion franchise was awarded to lawyer [[Joseph Robbie]] and actor [[Danny Thomas]] in 1965 for $7.5 million, although Thomas would eventually sell his stake in the team to Robbie.<ref name=\"nd650721\">{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |work=[[The Nevada Daily Mail]] |title=Football League Trying Dixie Expansion |page=10 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XEMrAAAAIBAJ&pg=2822,3612744&dq=dixie+football-league&hl=en |date=July 21, 1965 |access-date=May 15, 2010 |archive-date=April 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428032650/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XEMrAAAAIBAJ&pg=2822%2C3612744&dq=dixie+football-league&hl=en |url-status=live }}</ref> During the summer of 1966, the Dolphins' training camp was in [[St. Pete Beach]] with practices in August at [[Boca Ciega High School]] in [[Gulfport, Florida|Gulfport]].<ref>Armistead, Tom \"On the Departing Dolphins: Observations and Conclusions\" (August 4, 1966), ''Evening Independent''</ref>\n\nThe Dolphins were the worst team with a 15\u201339\u20132 record in their first four seasons under head coach [[George Wilson (football coach)|George Wilson]], before [[Don Shula]] was hired as head coach. Shula was a [[Paul Brown]] disciple who had been lured from the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]], after losing [[Super Bowl III]] two seasons earlier to the AFL's [[New York Jets]], and finishing 8\u20135\u20131 the following season. Shula got his first NFL coaching job from then-Detroit head coach George Wilson, who hired him as the defensive coordinator. The AFL [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merged with the NFL]] in 1970, and the Dolphins were assigned to the [[AFC East]] division in the NFL's new [[American Football Conference]].\n\nFor the rest of the 20th century, the Shula-led Dolphins emerged as one of the most dominant teams in the NFL, with only two losing seasons between 1970 and 1999. They were extremely successful in the 1970s, completing the first complete [[perfect season]] in NFL history by finishing with a 14\u20130 regular-season record in [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972]] and winning the [[Super Bowl VII|Super Bowl that year]]. It was the first of two consecutive Super Bowl wins and one of three appearances in a row. The 1980s and 1990s were also moderately successful. The early 80s teams made two Super Bowls despite losing both times and saw the emergence of future Hall of Fame quarterback [[Dan Marino]], who went on to break numerous NFL passing records, holding many of them until the late 2000s. After winning every game against the division rival [[Buffalo Bills]] in the 1970s, the two teams gradually developed a [[Bills\u2013Dolphins rivalry|competitive rivalry]] in the 80s and 90s, often competing for AFC supremacy when [[Jim Kelly]] emerged as the quarterback for the Bills. The Dolphins have also maintained a [[Dolphins\u2013Jets rivalry|strong rivalry]] with the [[New York Jets]] throughout much of their history.\n\n[[File:JoeRobbie1 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Joe Robbie]], founder and former principal owner of the Dolphins (1966\u20131990)]]\n[[File: Don Shula Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of coach [[Don Shula]] outside of Hard Rock Stadium]]\nFollowing the retirements of Marino and Shula and the rise of [[Tom Brady]] and the [[New England Patriots]], the Dolphins suffered a decline in the 2000s and 2010s.

The rivalry was extremely lopsided in favor of Miami during the 1970s, as the Dolphins won all 20 games against the Bills during that decade. Fortunes changed in the 1980s and 1990s when [[Jim Kelly]] became the Bills' starting quarterback. Though both teams were extremely dominant during that period, the Bills ultimately held the edge and dominated the Dolphins during their four playoff matchups in the 1990s, with the Dolphins' only playoff win coming after Kelly's retirement. With the rise of Tom Brady and the Patriots during the 2000s and the retirements of Kelly and Dolphins quarterback [[Dan Marino]], the Bills-Dolphins rivalry faded in relevance, but remains somewhat intense to this day. Some former Dolphins have gone to play for the Bills as well, most notably [[Dan Carpenter]], [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]], and [[Charles Clay (American football)|Charles Clay]].\n\nIn the 2020s, the rivalry sharpened, with Dolphins quarterback [[Tua Tagovailoa]], drafted in 2020, leading a resurgent Dolphins team against the [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]]-led Bills, who had gained a streak of success after Brady's departure from the Patriots and the division. Though Allen's career record against Miami currently stands at 9\u20132, Tagovailoa led the Dolphins to their first win over Bills in 8 games in 2022, and the Dolphins played the Bills tightly in the teams' two other meetings that year despite losing both, including the playoffs.\n\n=== New England Patriots ===\n{{main|Dolphins\u2013Patriots rivalry}}\nThe Dolphins dominated the [[New England Patriots]] during the 1970s and the 1990s, but there were some notable moments as well, including a 1982 game now known as the [[Snowplow Game]]. Fortunes changed when [[Tom Brady]] became the franchise quarterback for the Patriots, and during his [[Brady\u2013Belichick era|tenure with the Patriots]], New England dominated the AFC, especially the AFC East, winning 16 of 17 division titles between 2003 and 2019, with the Dolphins winning the only non-Patriots division title in that time frame when Brady was out due to injury. Miami posed the biggest divisional challenge to the Brady-led Patriots, however, winning more games against them than the Bills or Jets did during that era.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schad |first=Joe |title=Loved to hear it: Tom Brady cites Dolphins defense of early 2000's as toughest |url=https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/sports/nfl/2021/10/26/tom-brady-says-miami-dolphins-defense-toughest-he-faced-and-they-heard/8549472002/ |access-date=2022-06-26 |website=The Palm Beach Post |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Which defense gave Brady the most trouble?

Miami and New England are also the only two franchises to have posted undefeated regular-season records since the NFL-AFL merger, with Miami going [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|14\u20130 in 1972]] and New England going [[2007 New England Patriots season|16\u20130 in 2007]], but only the 1972 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl.\n\n=== New York Jets ===\n{{main|Dolphins\u2013Jets rivalry}}\nThe [[New York Jets]] are perhaps Miami's most bitter rivals.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yousefi |first=Ryan |title=The New York Jets Will Forever Be South Florida's Most Hated Rival |language=en |work=Miami New Times |url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/dolphins-jets-is-still-the-best-rivalry-in-south-florida-sports-10721666 |access-date=2022-10-21}}</ref> Dolphins fans despise the Jets due to the sheer amount of New York City transplants who have moved to South Florida and the Jets' usual cocky demeanor. Just as the Bills-Dolphins rivalry is motivated by differences, the Dolphins-Jets series is also notable for the differences between New York and Miami. Unlike the former, this rivalry has been more consistent over the years. Some of the more memorable moments in this rivalry include [[Dan Marino]]'s [[Clock Play|fake spike]], [[Vinny Testaverde]] leading the Jets to a [[Monday Night Miracle (American football)|notable comeback on Monday Night Football]], and former Jets quarterback [[Chad Pennington]] signing with the Dolphins and leading them to a divisional title.

The Dolphins and Colts faced off several times in the AFC playoffs during the 1970s, including the AFC championship game leading up to [[Super Bowl VI]], which the Dolphins lost to the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The rivalry cooled down in the 1980s after the Colts struggled and [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|moved to Indianapolis]], but heated up once again in the late 90s until the Colts were reassigned into the [[AFC South]] as a result of the 2002 realignment of the NFL's divisions.<ref name=\"Other AFC rivals\"/>\n\n=== Other AFC rivals ===\n{{see also|Dolphins\u2013Raiders rivalry|The Sea of Hands|Epic in Miami}}\nThe Dolphins also share historic rivalries with other AFC teams such as the [[Las Vegas Raiders]], [[Los Angeles Chargers]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], stemming from often competing against these teams in the playoffs during the Don Shula era, and to a lesser extent, the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], who also represent the state of Florida.<ref name=\"Other AFC rivals\">{{cite web|title=Who Are the Miami Dolphins' Biggest Non-AFC East Rivals?|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/423679-who-are-the-miami-dolphins-biggest-non-afc-east-rivals|first=Thomas|last=Galicia|website=Bleacher Report|date=July 22, 2010|access-date=August 30, 2017|archive-date=August 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831044813/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/423679-who-are-the-miami-dolphins-biggest-non-afc-east-rivals|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Stadiums===\n[[File:NFL Jets at Dolphins-Sun Life Stadium-2012-09-24.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hard Rock Stadium]] in 2012.]]\n[[File:Miami Orange Bowl (Super Bowl V).jpg|thumb|right|[[Miami Orange Bowl]], the former home of the Dolphins (1966\u20131986)]]\nThe Dolphins originally played all home games in the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] in Miami.

The team's colors were originally [[Aqua (color)|aqua]] and [[coral (color)|coral]], with the coral color paying tribute to the Miami Seahawks and to the many natural coral reefs in Biscayne Bay. The team's original logo consisted of a sunburst with a leaping dolphin wearing a football helmet bearing the letter M. At their debut in 1966, a lighter & brighter orange was used instead of the deep coral color. The dolphin's head was near the center of the sunburst. In the 1967 season, the dolphin was centered on the sunburst, but it reverted to the original placement between 1968 and 1973. By 1974, the dolphin's body was centered on the sunburst in a slightly smaller logo than the 1967 version. The uniforms featured white pants with aqua and orange stripes, paired with either a white or aqua jersey. On the white jersey, aqua block numbers and names were outlined in orange, with aqua and orange sleeve stripes. Starting with the 1972 perfect season, these uniforms were used as the primary uniforms for road games and daytime home games, due to the extreme heat of South Florida. The team also had an aqua jersey used mainly for night home games or road games in which the opponent chose to wear white. The aqua jersey featured white block numbers and names with an orange outline, and orange and white sleeve stripes.\n\nAn update was given to the logo in 1997 \u2013 the sunburst was simplified and the dolphin was darkened and given a more serious game-face expression.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Highlights |url=http://www.miamidolphins.com/history/historicalhighlights/historicalhighlights12.asp |publisher=Miami Dolphins |date=June 3, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020604213955/http://miamidolphins.com/history/historicalhighlights/historicalhighlights12.asp |archive-date=June 4, 2002 |access-date=November 25, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The uniforms remained the same; however, a different block number font was used and navy drop shadows were added.\n\nOn very rare occasions, an orange jersey was used for primetime games. The uniforms essentially swapped the location of orange and aqua from the aqua jersey. The orange jersey was first used on a Sunday night in 2003 against [[Washington Redskins|Washington]], a Dolphin win. In 2004, the orange jersey was brought back for an ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' match pitting the 2\u201311 Dolphins against the 12\u20131 defending champion [[New England Patriots]]. The Dolphins scored a huge upset win after trailing by 11 points with less than 5 minutes remaining. Due to the unusual orange jerseys, the game has become known within some Dolphin circles as \"[[2004 New England Patriots season#Week 15: at Miami Dolphins|The Night That Courage Wore Orange]]\".<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/riFY4A6wXIU Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20141105105832/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riFY4A6wXIU&feature=player_embedded Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite AV media|people=rebellionmx|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riFY4A6wXIU|date=October 12, 2009|title=The Night Courage Wore Orange.

However, the Dolphins would lose a 2010 Sunday night matchup with the Jets, their first loss in orange, and the orange jerseys in the original style would not be worn again.\n\nIn 2009, the Dolphins switched to black shoes for the first time since the early 1970s glory days, following a recent trend among NFL teams. However, by 2011, they returned to wearing white shoes.\n\nThe Dolphins' final game in the original style uniforms with block numbers and the iconic leaping dolphin logo was the final game of the 2012 season, a 28\u20130 shutout loss to the New England Patriots in [[Gillette Stadium|Foxboro]]. The white jerseys were worn for the game, and as rumors of a new look had been swirling, many fans watching knew that it would likely be the last time their team would wear the leaping dolphin logo.\n\n====Stylized swimming dolphin (2013\u2013present)====\nA radically new logo and new uniforms were unveiled shortly before the [[2013 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sessler|first=Marc|title=Miami Dolphins confirm they have new logo|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000154510/article/miami-dolphins-confirm-they-have-new-logo|publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com|date=March 27, 2013|access-date=March 27, 2013|archive-date=March 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329083937/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000154510/article/miami-dolphins-confirm-they-have-new-logo|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Pugh|first=Jesse|title=Dee Confirms Logo Evolution|url=http://assets.dolphinsdigital.com/blog/2013/dee-confirms-logo-evolution?_ga=1.187286123.2147278759.1470620679|publisher=The Finsiders|date=March 29, 2013|access-date=March 29, 2013|archive-date=August 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821101412/http://assets.dolphinsdigital.com/blog/2013/dee-confirms-logo-evolution?_ga=1.187286123.2147278759.1470620679|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Mike Florio|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/03/27/dolphins-confirm-new-logo/|title=Dolphins confirm new logo|publisher=NBC Sports|work=Pro Football Talk|date=March 27, 2013|access-date=March 27, 2013|archive-date=March 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330061805/http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/03/27/dolphins-confirm-new-logo/|url-status=live}}</ref> The new logo features a stylized [[aqua (color)|aqua]] dolphin swimming in front of a heavily modified version of the orange sunburst. The dolphin in the logo is more vague and artistic, and is not wearing a helmet as it is merely a silhouette of a dolphin cast in aqua and navy.\n\nNavy was incorporated as featured color for the first time, with orange becoming greatly de-emphasized. The uniforms feature both white pants and aqua pants, with a white or aqua jersey. The Dolphins continue to wear white at home, just as they had with the previous uniforms, with aqua being used for primetime home games. The white jersey features aqua numbers and names in a unique custom font, with orange and navy outlines on the numbers; however, the names only use navy as an outline color. The aqua jerseys use white numbers with an orange and aqua outline, and white names with a navy outline. The helmets are white with a white facemask, just like the final years of the previous look; however, navy is a prominent color on the helmet stripe, joining aqua and a de-emphasized orange. Both jerseys have large \"Dolphins\" text above the numbers, written in the team's new script.

Four years later, they brought back a white version from the same era as a second alternate uniform. The aqua throwbacks were worn during the now-famous 2018 [[Miracle in Miami]] play against the Patriots.\n\n====Color Rush uniform====\nOn September 29, 2016, the Dolphins debuted their new [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform in a [[Thursday Night Football]] game against the [[2016 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]]. The all-orange uniform marked the first time since 2010 that the Dolphins wore an orange uniform. However, the set was only used for that game as the Dolphins immediately retired the uniform soon after.\n\nIn later years, the Dolphins wore similar all-aqua or all-white uniforms in select games as the NFL gradually relaxed its rules regarding hosiery.\n\n===Fight song===\nThe song was written and composed by Lee Ofman, and has similar instrumentation and lyrics to the fight song of the [[Houston Oilers]]. Ofman approached the Dolphins with it before the 1972 season because he wanted music to inspire his favorite team. The fight song would soon serve as a good luck charm for the Dolphins that season. The Dolphins became the first team in NFL history to record an undefeated season, going 17\u20130 en route to victory over the Washington Redskins in [[Super Bowl VII]]. The following season, Miami posted an equally impressive 15\u20132 record and capped the season with another title, defeating the Minnesota Vikings in [[Super Bowl VIII]]. The back-to-back championship runs, coupled with the popularity of the fight song amongst Dolphins fans, have ensured the song's longevity. The Dolphins revealed a new fight song by [[T-Pain]] and [[Jimmy Buffett]] featuring [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] on August 7, 2009, which was introduced for the 2009 NFL season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wright |first1=Todd |title=Dolphins Become Death of Autotune |url=https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/sports/Dolphins-Fight-Song-Goes-Autotune-52679517.html |website=NBC 6 South Florida |access-date=November 28, 2019 |date=August 7, 2009 |archive-date=November 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128101837/https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/sports/Dolphins-Fight-Song-Goes-Autotune-52679517.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The fight song was played during the preseason home opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2009, but was not played during the second preseason game against the Carolina Panthers on August 22, 2009, after being booed heavily in the first game.

'''Bold''' indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nEach of these players is honored with a placard on the facing of the upper level around Hard Rock Stadium including team founder-owner Joe Robbie. In place of a jersey number, Shula has the number 347, representing his record number of NFL coaching victories, 274 of them as Dolphins head coach.\n\nIn 1992, at the 20 year anniversary, Miami's \"1972 Undefeated Team\" was enshrined into the Honor Roll. At the 40 year anniversary, which enshrined former defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger into the Honor Roll, his name went on the Honor Roll where the \"1972 Undefeated Team\" inductee previously and originally was enshrined, and an updated \"1972 Perfect Season Team 17\u20130\" inductee was put into one corner of Hard Rock Stadium with special placards of Super Bowl VII and Super Bowl VIII included next to it on each side.\n\nThe inductees as of 2014 include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins|border=2}}\"| Miami Dolphins Honor Roll\n|-\n!style=\"width:40px;{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}}\"| No.\n!style=\"width:180px;{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}}\"| Name\n!style=\"width:120px;{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}}\"| Position(s)\n!style=\"width:80px;{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}}\"| Years with club\n!style=\"width:60px;{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}}\"| Inducted\n|-\n| \u2014 || [[Joe Robbie]] || Owner/founder || 1966\u20131989 ||rowspan=\"5\"| 1990\n|-\n| 39 || '''[[Larry Csonka]]''' || [[Fullback (gridiron football)|FB]] || 1968\u20131974, 1979 \n|-\n| 12 || '''[[Bob Griese]]''' || [[Quarterback|QB]] || 1967\u20131980 \n|-\n| 62 || '''[[Jim Langer]]''' || [[Center (American football)|C]] || 1970\u20131979 \n|-\n| 42 || '''[[Paul Warfield]]''' || [[Wide receiver|WR]] || 1970\u20131974 \n|-\n| 85 || '''[[Nick Buoniconti]]''' || [[Linebacker|LB]] || 1969\u20131974, 1976 || 1991\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"| [[Miami Dolphins 1972 season|1972 Undefeated Team]] || 1992\n|-\n| 66 || '''[[Larry Little]]''' || [[Guard (American football)|G]] || 1969\u20131980 || 1993\n|-\n| 57 || '''[[Dwight Stephenson]]''' || [[Center (American football)|C]] || 1980\u20131987 || 1994\n|-\n| 67 || [[Bob Kuechenberg]] || [[Guard (American football)|G]] || 1970\u20131984 || 1995\n|-\n| 347 || '''[[Don Shula]]''' || Head coach || 1970\u20131995 || 1996\n|-\n| 89 || [[Nat Moore]] || [[Wide receiver|WR]] || 1974\u20131986 || 1999\n|-\n| 13 || '''[[Dan Marino]]''' || [[Quarterback|QB]] || 1983\u20131999 || 2000\n|-\n| 83 || [[Mark Clayton (American football, born 1961)|Mark Clayton]] || [[Wide receiver|WR]] || 1983\u20131992 ||rowspan=\"2\"| 2003\n|-\n| 85 || [[Mark Duper]] || [[Wide receiver|WR]] || 1982\u20131992 \n|-\n| 40 || [[Dick Anderson]] || [[Safety (gridiron football position)|S]] || 1968\u20131977 ||rowspan=\"2\"| 2006\n|-\n| 78 || [[Richmond Webb]] || [[Offensive tackle|OT]] || 1990\u20132000 \n|-\n| 73 || [[Bob Baumhower]] || [[Defensive tackle|DT]] || 1977\u20131986 ||rowspan=\"2\"| 2008\n|-\n| 75 || [[Doug Betters]] || [[Defensive end|DE]] || 1978\u20131987 \n|-\n| 13 || [[Jake Scott]] || [[Safety (gridiron football position)|S]] || 1970\u20131975 ||rowspan=\"2\"| 2010\n|-\n| 84 || [[Bill Stanfill]] || [[Defensive end|DE]] || 1969\u20131976 \n|-\n| 88 || [[Jim Mandich]] || [[Tight end|TE]]/Radio Broadcaster || 1970\u20131977 / 1992\u20132004, 2007\u20132010 || 2011\n|-\n| \u2014 || [[Bill Arnsparger]] || Defensive Coordinator || 1970\u20131973<br />1976\u20131983 ||rowspan=\"4\"| 2012\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"| [[Super Bowl VII]] Team<br />[[Miami Dolphins 1972 season|1972 Perfect Season Team 17\u20130]]<br />[[Super Bowl VIII]] Team\n| UPDATED 1992 Inductee \n|-\n| 99 || '''[[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]]''' || [[Defensive end|DE]] || 1997\u20132007, 2009, 2011 \n|-\n| 54 || '''[[Zach Thomas]]''' || [[Linebacker|LB]] || 1996\u20132007 \n|-\n| 56 || [[John Offerdahl]] || [[Linebacker|LB]] || 1986\u20131993 || 2013\n|-\n| 75 || [[Manny Fernandez (American football)|Manny Fernandez]] || [[Defensive tackle|DT]] || 1968\u20131975 || 2014\n|}\n\n==The Joe Robbie Alumni Plaza \"Walk of Fame\"==\n[[File:Joe Robbie (Plaza).jpg|thumb|right|A statue of the original founder/owner of the Miami Dolphins from 1966-1989, [[Joe Robbie]], on display as the centerpiece to the Joe Robbie Alumni Plaza Walk of Fame.]]\nThe Joe Robbie Alumni Plaza Walk of Fame was first established in 2011, designed to be all-encompassing and recognize the best of the Miami Dolphins alumni, including those in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Honor Roll, and as well as the many other players who were among the unsung heroes and community leaders that the organization has produced.
