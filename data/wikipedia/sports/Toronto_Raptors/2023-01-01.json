The Raptors compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the league's [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]]. They play their home games at [[Scotiabank Arena]], which they share with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA's [[Expansion of the National Basketball Association|expansion]] into Canada, along with the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]]. Since the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]], the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league, as the Grizzlies [[Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis|relocated]] from [[Vancouver]] to [[Memphis, Tennessee]].\n\nAs with most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of [[Vince Carter]] through a [[1998 NBA draft|draft-day trade in 1998]], the franchise set league-attendance records and made the [[NBA playoffs]] in [[2000 NBA playoffs|2000]], [[2001 NBA playoffs|2001]], and [[2002 NBA playoffs|2002]]. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the [[2002\u201303 Toronto Raptors season|2002\u201303]] and [[2003\u201304 Toronto Raptors season|2003\u201304 seasons]], they failed to make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the [[Brooklyn Nets|New Jersey Nets]].\n\nAfter Carter left, [[Chris Bosh]] emerged as the team leader. For the [[2006\u201307 Toronto Raptors season|2006\u201307 season]], [[Bryan Colangelo]] was appointed as general manager, and through a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall draft pick [[Andrea Bargnani]], and a revamp of the roster, the Raptors qualified for their [[2007 NBA playoffs|first playoff berth in five years]], capturing the Atlantic Division title. In the [[2007\u201308 Toronto Raptors season|2007\u201308 season]], they also advanced to the [[2008 NBA playoffs|playoffs]] but failed to reach the postseason in each of the next five seasons. Colangelo overhauled the team's roster for the [[2009\u201310 Toronto Raptors season|2009\u201310 season]] in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay, but Bosh departed to sign with the [[Miami Heat]] in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors.\n\n[[Masai Ujiri]] replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of [[DeMar DeRozan]] and [[Kyle Lowry]]. The Raptors returned to the [[2014 NBA playoffs|playoffs]] the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in [[2017\u201318 Toronto Raptors season|2018]]. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach [[Dwane Casey]] after the [[2018 NBA playoffs|2018 playoffs]] concluded and to trade DeRozan for [[Kawhi Leonard]] and [[Danny Green (basketball)|Danny Green]] later that summer, as well as to acquire [[Marc Gasol]] before the [[Trade (sports)#NBA 2|trade deadline]]. Toronto also saw the breakout of [[Pascal Siakam]], the 27th overall pick in the [[2016 NBA draft]], who won the [[NBA Most Improved Player Award|NBA Most Improved Player]] that year. In the [[2019 NBA playoffs|2019 playoffs]], the Raptors won their first [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference]] title and advanced to their first [[2019 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they won their first NBA championship.\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Background===\nOn November 1, 1946, the [[Toronto Huskies]] hosted the [[New York Knicks|New York Knickerbockers]] at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto, in what was the first game played in NBA history (as the [[Basketball Association of America]]).

The uniforms were released in partnership with [[2K Sports]]' ''[[NBA 2K16]]'' video game. The team said in a press release that the new uniform designs were intended to pay tribute to the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on [[National colours of Canada|Canada's national colours of red and white]], whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of \"We The North\". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's \"We The North\" slogan. The team said the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they tuck in their jerseys. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo on the front of the waistband, and the letter \"T\" is now on the sides of the shorts with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to the city of Toronto's [[Name of Toronto#Nicknames|\"T-Dot\" nickname]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Raptors Unveil New Uniforms|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/press-releases/uniforms-080315|publisher=NBA Media Ventures|website=www.nba.com|date=August 3, 2015|access-date=August 11, 2015}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:left; width:35%;\">\n;2015\u22122017\n{{Fb_kit_header}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15home\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15home\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Home\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15road\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15road\n| body       = 000000\n| shorts     = 000000\n| title      = Road\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road Alt.\n}}\n|\n{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt2\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt2\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road (OVO)\n}}\n{{Fb kit footer|s=[http://www.jerseymuseum.org/team/toronto-raptors/jerseys/ jerseymuseum.org]|date=July 2019}}\n</div>{{clear}}\n\n====2017 onward====\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's partnership with Nike, each team was allotted four primary uniforms, classified as \"editions\".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Nike and the NBA Reveal the First of the League's 2017-18 Game Uniforms|url=https://news.nike.com/news/nike-nba-game-uniforms|publisher=Nike|website=nike.com|date=June 18, 2017}}</ref> The Raptors made small changes to their regular home (now called \"Association edition\") and road (now the \"Icon edition\") uniforms, as well as their alternate (\"Statement edition\") uniforms.
