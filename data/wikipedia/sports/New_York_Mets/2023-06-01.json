Blue and orange are also the colors of New York City, as seen on its [[Flag of New York City|flag]].<ref name=\"timeline1\" />\n\nIn 1998, black was added to the color scheme, although beginning with 2012 the black elements in the uniform began to be phased out, and were eliminated in 2013.\n\n===Logo===\nThe primary logo, designed by sports cartoonist Ray Gotto, consists of \"Mets\" written in orange script trimmed in white across a blue representation of the New York City skyline with a white suspension bridge in the foreground, all contained in an orange circle with orange baseball stitching across the image. Each part of the skyline has special meaning\u2014at the left is a church spire, symbolic of Brooklyn, the borough of churches; the second building from the left is the [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Building]], the tallest building in Brooklyn at the time of the team's founding; next is the [[Woolworth Building]]; after a general skyline view of midtown comes the [[Empire State Building]]; at the far right is the [[headquarters of the United Nations]]. The suspension bridge in the center symbolizes that the Mets, by bringing National League baseball back to New York, represent all five boroughs; many of New York's major bridges are suspension designs.<ref name=\"timeline1\" /> In 1999, the logo received a slight alteration; a small \"NY\" originally placed to the left of the team script was removed. No other notable changes have ever been made to the logo.\n\nThe cap logo consists of an orange, interlocking \"NY\" identical to the logo used by the New York Giants in their final years, and is on a blue cap reminiscent of the caps worn by the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nWith the introduction of black as an official color, an alternate team logo was created in 1999. It is identical to the original logo, but the skyline is black instead of blue and the \"Mets\" script is blue trimmed in orange and white instead of orange trimmed in white (the alternate black jerseys displayed the primary blue and orange logo on the left sleeves in 1998; in 1999 this was changed to the alternate black and blue logo). The logo fell into disuse after the Mets dropped the alternate black jerseys and caps in 2012. In 2021, alternate black jerseys returned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/mets-announce-black-jerseys-2021|title=Mets bring 'swagger' back with black jerseys|last=DiComo|first=Anthony|date=March 29, 2021|website=MLB.com|access-date=March 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mets-fans-black-jerseys-valentines-144632041.html|title=Mets fans and the black jerseys: A love story|last=Abriano|first=Danny|date=March 29, 2021|website=sports.yahoo.com|access-date=March 29, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Uniform color and design===\nCurrently, the Mets wear an assortment of uniforms.\n\nThe home uniforms are white with blue pinstripes and feature \"Mets\" in blue script with an orange outline across the chest, and block letter player names and numbers also in blue with an orange outline. The uniforms are paired with a blue cap featuring an \"NY\" logo in orange, plus blue undersleeves, belts and socks.\n\nThe gray road jerseys feature a radially-arched \"NEW YORK\" in Tiffany-style letters across the chest, block letter player numerals and names in blue outlined in orange, and blue placket and sleeve piping. Like the home uniforms, the road grays are worn with the same blue caps, undersleeves, belts and socks.\n\nThe blue alternate uniform, introduced in 2012, features the \"Mets\" script and block lettering and numbers in orange with white outline, and orange piping. The blue alternates are worn with a secondary blue cap featuring the \"NY\" logo in orange trimmed in white.\n\nThe black alternate uniform, introduced in its current form in 2022, is a modified version of the uniform worn from 1998 to 2012 and reintroduced for Friday home games in 2021. The lettering is blue with white trim and orange drop shadows, lacked the blue piping of the previous iteration, and has the primary logo (sans black) on the left sleeve. The set is worn with an alternate black cap featuring the \"NY\" logo in blue trimmed in white with orange drop shadows. Belts and socks worn with it are also black. Both the blue and black alternate uniforms are worn with plain white pants with blue piping.\n\nThe Mets' standard blue batting helmet, with the \"NY\" in metallic orange, is currently used for games worn with the primary home, road and blue alternate jerseys. A black alternate helmet is used in games with the black jerseys.\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = \n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =
