Beginning with 2012 the black elements in the uniform began to be phased out, and were eliminated in 2013.

Each part of the skyline has special meaning\u2014at the left is a church spire, symbolic of Brooklyn, the borough of churches; the second building from the left is the [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Building]], the tallest building in Brooklyn at the time of the team's founding; next is the [[Woolworth Building]]; after a general skyline view of midtown comes the [[Empire State Building]]; at the far right is the [[headquarters of the United Nations]]. The suspension bridge in the center symbolizes that the Mets, by bringing National League baseball back to New York, represent all five boroughs; many of New York's major bridges are suspension designs.<ref name=\"timeline1\" /> In 1999, the logo received a slight alteration; a small \"NY\" originally placed to the left of the team script was removed.\n\nWith the introduction of black as an official color, an alternate team logo was created in 1999. It is identical to the original logo, but the skyline is black instead of blue and the \"Mets\" script is blue trimmed in orange and white instead of orange trimmed in white (the alternate black jerseys displayed the primary blue and orange logo on the left sleeves in 1998; in 1999 this was changed to the alternate black and blue logo). The logo fell into disuse after the Mets dropped the alternate black jerseys and caps in 2012. When the team brought back the black jerseys in 2021, they feature the blue and orange logo patch instead of the black and blue logo.\n\nToward the end of the 2014 season, the Mets made a slight alteration to their logo on their [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] accounts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.sportslogos.net/2014/09/16/did-the-mets-try-to-sneak-a-new-logo-past-us/baseball/|last=Creamer|first=Chris|date=September 16, 2014|title=Did the Mets Try to Sneak a New Logo Past Us?|website=SportsLogos.net}}</ref> The roof of the building to the far right was tilted, changing it from the United Nations building to the [[Citigroup Center]].

The uniforms are paired with a blue cap featuring an \"NY\" logo in orange, plus blue undersleeves, belts and socks.\n\nThe gray road jerseys feature a radially-arched \"NEW YORK\" in Tiffany-style letters across the chest, block letter player numerals and names in blue outlined in orange, and blue placket and sleeve piping. Like the home uniforms, the road grays are worn with the same blue caps, undersleeves, belts and socks.\n\nThe blue alternate uniform, introduced in 2012, features the \"Mets\" script and block lettering and numbers in orange with white outline, and orange piping. The blue alternates are worn with a secondary blue cap featuring the \"NY\" logo in orange trimmed in white.\n\nThe black alternate uniform, introduced in its current form in 2024, is a modified version of the uniform worn from 1998 to 2012 and reintroduced for Friday home games in 2021. The lettering is blue with orange trim, lacked the blue piping, white trim and orange drop shadow of the previous iteration, and has the primary logo (sans black) on the left sleeve. The set is worn with an alternate black cap featuring the \"NY\" logo in blue trimmed in orange. Belts and socks worn with it are also black. Both the blue and black alternate uniforms are worn with plain white pants with blue piping.\n\nNew for 2024 is a dark gray [[City Connect]] uniform with black and purple accents. The uniform contains the \"NYC\" wordmark in black patterned after the team's road uniform, along with black pinstripes and a black subway token patch containing the purple \"NY\" logo. The dark gray cap features the \"NY\" logo in black trimmed in white, along with a silhouette of the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. The purple color was inspired by the [[7 (New York City Subway service)|7 Line]] that runs to Citi Field.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/mets-unveil-city-connect-uniforms|title=IYKYK: Mets' City Connect jerseys are for all of NYC|last=DiComo|first=Anthony|date=April 19, 2024|website=[[MLB.com]]|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|access-date=June 26, 2024}}</ref>\n\nThe Mets' standard blue batting helmet, with the \"NY\" in metallic orange, is currently used for games worn with the primary home, road and blue alternate jerseys.

The Braves rivalry is due to division realignment that put both teams in the [[National League East]] in {{mlby|1994}}. Their rivalry with the Yankees has its roots in the histories of the New York Giants, Brooklyn Dodgers, and the Yankees and the fierce Subway Series matchups between the two teams.

Until [[Interleague play]] started, the two teams had only met in exhibition games. Since the inception of interleague play the two teams have met every regular season since 1997, and since 1999 they have met six times each season, playing two three-game series, one in each team's ballpark. From the 2013 season however the number of games was reduced to four, two at each ballpark with the Mets winning six of the last eight games in that span. They have made the postseason in the same year six times: 1999, 2000, 2006, 2015, 2022, and 2024, and faced off in the [[2000 World Series]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2021/09/13/francisco-lindor-mets-yankees-subway-series-emotions/8314463002/|title=Cheating allegations, yelling, a three-home run game: Mets, Yankees fire up emotional rivalry|last=Nightendale|first=Bob|date=September 13, 2021|website=[[USA Today]]|access-date=April 7, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/mets-yankees-new-york-2021-rivalry|title=Mets-Yankees rivalry hotter than ever|last=Lupica|first=Mike|date=January 16, 2021|website=MLB.com|access-date=April 7, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://empiresportsmedia.com/new-york-mets/fennelly-new-york-mets-fans-were-born-out-of-hatred-for-yankees/|title=Fennelly: New York Mets Fans Were Born Out of Hatred for Yankees|last=Fennelly|first=John|date=January 6, 2020|website=Empire Sports Media|access-date=September 19, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Atlanta Braves===\n{{main|Braves\u2013Mets rivalry}}\n\nThe Braves\u2013Mets [[Major League Baseball rivalries|rivalry]] is a rivalry between two teams in the [[National League East]], featuring the [[Atlanta Braves]] and the Mets.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Olson |author-link=Lisa Olson |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2003/07/08/2003-07-08_crazy_scene_at_shea_takes_lu.html?print=1&viewall=1 |title=Crazy scene at Shea takes luster off Mets-Braves rivalry |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=July 8, 2003 |access-date=July 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613234758/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/crazy-scene-shea-takes-luster-mets-braves-rivalry-article-1.528122 |archive-date=June 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/10/sports/baseball/10rivalry.html|title=Meaningful Renewal to Mets and Braves Rivalry|last=Waldstein|first=David|date=July 9, 2010|website=[[New York Times]]|access-date=July 9, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/mets/2011/06/revisiting_the_mets_and_braves.html|title=Revisiting the Mets and Braves Rivalry|last=Saladino|first=Thomas|date=June 4, 2011|website=nj.com|access-date=April 9, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2022/07/13/mets-braves-growing-into-real-nl-east-rivalry/|title=Mets-Braves growing into real NL East rivalry|last=Vaccaro|first=Mike|date=July 13, 2022|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=August 9, 2022}}</ref>\n\nAlthough their first major confrontation occurred when the Mets swept the Braves in the [[1969 National League Championship Series|1969 NLCS]], en route to their first [[World Series]] championship, the first playoff series won by an expansion team (also the first playoff appearance by an expansion team), the rivalry did not become especially heated until the 1990s, when a division realignment in 1994 put the Mets and the Braves in the NL East together (from 1969 to 1993, the Braves were in the NL West).<ref>{{cite news|quote=The Pirates will switch from the East next season.
