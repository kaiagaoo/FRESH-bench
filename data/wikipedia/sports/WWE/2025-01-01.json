McMahon and Toots Mondt were very successful and soon controlled approximately 70% of the NWA's booking power, largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated [[Northeastern United States]]. In 1963, McMahon and Mondt had a dispute with the NWA over [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|\"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers]] being booked to hold the [[NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].<ref name=\"won2011\">{{cite journal|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=July 20, 2011|title=NWA World Heavyweight Championship}}</ref> Mondt and McMahon were not only promoters but also acted as his manager and were accused by other NWA promoters of withholding Rogers making defenses in their cities versus only defending in Mondt and McMahon's own cities thus maintaining a monopoly on the world title. In a now infamous situation, the NWA sent former five-time world champion and legitimate wrestler [[Lou Thesz]] to Toronto to face Rogers on January 24, 1963. Thesz recalls this was not planned and prior to the match remembered telling Buddy \"we can do this the easy way or the hard way.\" Rogers agreed to lose the fall and title in a one fall match versus the traditional two out of three fall matchup that most world title matches were defended. Once word reached back to Mondt and McMahon, at first they simply ignored the title change. From January until April 1963, Rogers was promoted as the NWA World Champion, or simply the World Heavyweight Champion, in their area. The World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) was not an immediate creation after Rogers's one fall loss to Thesz. Mondt and McMahon both eventually left the NWA in protest and formed the WWWF in the process. They brought along with them [[Willie Gilzenberg]], long time boxing and wrestling promoter in New Jersey. In April 1963, the [[WWE Championship|WWWF World Heavyweight Championship]] was created, with the promotion claiming that inaugural champion Rogers had won a tournament in Rio de Janeiro on April 25, 1963, defeating long time Capitol favorite [[Antonino Rocca]] in the finals. In reality, Rocca was no longer in the area, as he was working for [[Jim Crockett|Jim Crockett Sr.]] in the Carolinas. Rogers also had already suffered what would later be a career ending heart attack on April 18 in Akron, Ohio, and was in an Ohio hospital during the time the alleged tournament took place.<ref>{{cite web|title=WrestlingClassics.com Message Board: 1963 WWWF World Title Tournament in Rio|url=http://wrestlingclassics.com/cgi-bin/.ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=10;t=005277;p=3|access-date=February 19, 2021|website=wrestlingclassics.com}}</ref> Rogers lost the championship to [[Bruno Sammartino]] a month later on May 17, with the promotion beginning to be built around Sammartino shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/10-most-notorious-wwe-squash-matches|title=10 Most Notorious WWE Squash Matches|last=Binks|first=Elliott|date=May 23, 2015|website=WhatCulture.com|language=en|access-date=December 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1963, Gilzenberg was named the first president of the WWWF.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://smile.amazon.de/WWE-50-Kevin-Sullivan/dp/1465419233/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=50+years+wwe+book&qid=1580427614&sr=8-1-fkmr1|title=WWE 50: Celebrating 50 years of Sports Entertainment|last=Sullivan|first=Kevin|date=2014|publisher=BradyGames |isbn=978-1-4654-1923-1 }}</ref> Mondt left the promotion in the late 1960s and although the WWWF had previously withdrawn from the NWA, McMahon quietly re-joined in 1971.

The actual date of sale is still unknown but the generally accepted date is June 6, 1982; however, this was likely only the date the deal was struck but not finalized. On WWF television, Capitol Wrestling Corporation maintained copyrights and ownership past the June 1982 date. The World Wrestling Federation was not solely owned by Vincent J. McMahon but also by [[Gorilla Monsoon]], [[Arnold Skaaland]] and Phil Zacko. The deal between the two McMahons was a monthly payment basis, in which if a single payment was missed, ownership would revert to the elder McMahon and his business partners. Looking to seal the deal quickly, McMahon took several loans and deals with other promoters and the business partners (including the promise of a job for life) in order to take full ownership by May or June 1983 for an estimated total of roughly $1 million with the three business partners receiving roughly $815,000 among them and Vincent J. McMahon receiving roughly $185,000.<ref>Death of the Territories: Expansion, Betrayal and the War that Changed Pro Wrestling Forever by Tim Hornbaker.

This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions, eventually ending the territory system, which was in use since the founding of the NWA in the 1940s. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters. In an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', McMahon was quoted as saying: \"In the old days, there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country, each with its own little lord in charge. Each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord. No takeovers or raids were allowed. There were maybe 30 of these tiny kingdoms in the U.S. and if I hadn't bought out my dad, there would still be 30 of them, fragmented and struggling. I, of course, had no allegiance to those little lords.\"<ref name=si/>\n\nMcMahon gained significant traction when he hired [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) talent [[Hulk Hogan]], who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling, notably for his appearance in the film ''[[Rocky III]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|qid=Q241504|id=tt0084602}}</ref> McMahon signed [[Roddy Piper]] as Hogan's rival, and then shortly afterward [[Jesse Ventura]] as an announcer. Other wrestlers joined the roster, such as [[The Iron Sheik]], [[Nikolai Volkoff]], [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Greg Valentine]], and [[Ricky Steamboat]], joining existing stars such as [[Jimmy Snuka]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Sgt Slaughter|Sgt. Slaughter]] and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]]. Many of the wrestlers who would later join the WWF were former AWA or NWA talent.\n[[File:Hulk Hogan Pointing.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Hulk Hogan]], pictured in 1989, was the WWF's top star during the [[1980s professional wrestling boom]].]]\nThe WWF would tour nationally in a venture that would require a huge capital investment, one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse. The future of McMahon's experiment came down to the success or failure of McMahon's groundbreaking concept, [[WrestleMania]]. WrestleMania was a major success and was (and still is) marketed as the [[Super Bowl]] of professional wrestling. The concept of a wrestling [[Card (sports)|supercard]] was nothing new in North America; the NWA had begun running [[Starrcade]] a few years prior. In McMahon's eyes, however, what separated WrestleMania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling. He invited celebrities such as [[Mr. T]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Cyndi Lauper]] to participate in the event, as well as securing a deal with [[MTV]] to provide coverage. The event and hype surrounding it led to the term ''[[Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]'', due to the cross-promotion of [[popular culture]] and professional wrestling.\n\nThe WWF business expanded significantly on the shoulders of McMahon and his [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] hero Hulk Hogan for the next several years after defeating [[The Iron Sheik]] at Madison Square Garden on January 23, 1984.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hulk-hogan-beats-iron-sheik-to-win-first-wwf-title | title=Hulk Hogan beats Iron Sheik to win first WWF title }}</ref> The introduction of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on [[NBC]] in 1985 marked the first time that professional wrestling had been broadcast on network television since the 1950s when the now-defunct [[DuMont Television Network]] broadcast matches of Vincent J. McMahon's Capitol Wrestling Corporation.

The steroid trial cost the company an estimated $5 million at a time of record low revenues. This helped drive many WWF wrestlers over to rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), including 1980s babyface hero Hulk Hogan. During this period, the WWF promoted wrestlers of a younger age comprising \"The New Generation\", featuring [[Bret Hart]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]], [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]] and [[The Undertaker]] among others in an effort to promote new talent into the spotlight.\n\nIn January 1993, the WWF debuted its flagship cable program ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''.
