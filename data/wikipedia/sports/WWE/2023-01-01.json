A global integrated media and entertainment company, WWE has also branched out into other fields, including [[WWE Studios|film]], [[XFL (2001)|American football]], and [[#Expansion beyond wrestling|various other business ventures]]. The company is additionally involved in [[licensing]] its [[intellectual property]] to companies to produce [[List of WWE video games|video games]] and [[WWE action figures|action figures]].\n\nThe promotion was founded in 1953 as the [[Capitol Wrestling Corporation]]. It is the largest wrestling promotion in the world with its main roster divided up into two primary touring groups, along with a developmental roster based in [[Orlando, Florida]] (referred to by WWE as \"[[WWE brand extension|brands]]\"). Overall, WWE is available in more than 1 billion homes worldwide in 30 languages. The company's [[Titan Towers|global headquarters]] is located in [[Stamford, Connecticut]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/company/contacts.jsp|title=General WWE Contacts|work=WWE Corporate|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204105301/http://corporate.wwe.com/company/contacts.jsp|archive-date=February 4, 2009}}</ref> with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Mumbai, Shanghai, Singapore, Dubai and Munich.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://corporate.wwe.com/news/company-information|title=Company information|work=WWE Corporate|date=October 18, 2021}}</ref>\n\nAs in other professional wrestling promotions, WWE shows are not legitimate contests but [[Sports entertainment|entertainment-based]] performance theater, featuring [[Angle (professional wrestling)|story line]]-driven, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|scripted]], and partially-choreographed matches; however, matches often include moves that can put performers at risk of injury, even death, if not performed correctly. The pre-determined aspect of professional wrestling was publicly acknowledged by WWE's owner [[Vince McMahon]] in 1989 in order to avoid taxes from athletic commissions. WWE brands its product as [[sports entertainment]], acknowledging wrestling's roots in competitive sport and dramatic theater.\n\nThe company's majority owner is chairwoman and CEO, fifth-generation wrestling promoter and former wrestler Stephanie McMahon, who retains a 38.6% ownership of the company's outstanding stock and 81.1% of the voting power. The current entity, which was originally named '''Titan Sports, Inc.''', was incorporated on February 21, 1980, in [[South Yarmouth, Massachusetts]]. It acquired Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd., the holding company for the '''World Wrestling Federation''' ('''WWF'''), previously known as the '''World Wide Wrestling Federation''' ('''WWWF'''), in 1982. Titan was renamed '''World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc.''' in 1999, and then '''World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.''' in 2002.

McMahon with [[Verne Gagne]] and [[Bruno Sammartino]] in 1975.]]\n\nVincent J. McMahon and Toots Mondt were very successful and soon controlled approximately 70% of the NWA's booking power, largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated [[Northeastern United States]]. In 1963, McMahon and Mondt had a dispute with the NWA over [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|\"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers]] being booked to hold the [[NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].<ref name=\"won2011\">{{cite journal|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=July 20, 2011|title=NWA World Heavyweight Championship}}</ref> Mondt and McMahon were not only promoters but also acted as his manager and were accused by other NWA promoters of withholding Rogers making defenses in their cities versus only defending in Mondt and McMahon's own cities thus maintaining a monopoly on the world title. In a now infamous situation, the NWA sent former five-time world champion and legitimate wrestler [[Lou Thesz]] to Toronto to face Rogers on January 24, 1963. Thesz recalls this was not planned and prior to the match remembered telling Buddy \"we can do this the easy way or the hard way.\" Rogers agreed to lose the fall and title in a one fall match versus the traditional two out of three fall matchup that most world title matches were defended. Once word reached back to Mondt and McMahon, at first they simply ignored the title change. From January until April 1963, Rogers was promoted as the NWA World Champion, or simply the World Heavyweight Champion, in their area. The World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) was not an immediate creation after Rogers's one fall loss to Thesz. Mondt and McMahon both eventually left the NWA in protest and formed the WWWF in the process. They brought along with them Willie Gilzenberg, long time boxing and wrestling promoter in New Jersey. In April 1963, the [[WWE Championship|WWWF World Heavyweight Championship]] was created, with the promotion claiming that inaugural champion Rogers had won a tournament in Rio de Janeiro on April 25, 1963, defeating long time Capitol Sports favorite [[Antonino Rocca]] in the finals. In reality, Rocca was no longer in the area, as he was working for [[Jim Crockett|Jim Crockett Sr.]] in the Carolinas. Rogers also had already suffered what would later be a career ending heart attack on April 18 in Akron, Ohio, and was in an Ohio hospital during the time the alleged tournament took place.<ref>{{cite web|title=WrestlingClassics.com Message Board: 1963 WWWF World Title Tournament in Rio|url=http://wrestlingclassics.com/cgi-bin/.ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=10;t=005277;p=3|access-date=February 19, 2021|website=wrestlingclassics.com}}</ref> Rogers lost the championship to [[Bruno Sammartino]] a month later on May 17, with the promotion beginning to be built around Sammartino shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/10-most-notorious-wwe-squash-matches|title=10 Most Notorious WWE Squash Matches|last=Binks|first=Elliott|date=May 23, 2015|website=WhatCulture.com|language=en|access-date=December 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1963, Gilzenberg was named the first president of the WWWF.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://smile.amazon.de/WWE-50-Kevin-Sullivan/dp/1465419233/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=50+years+wwe+book&qid=1580427614&sr=8-1-fkmr1|title=WWE 50: Celebrating 50 years of Sports Entertainment|last=Sullivan|first=Kevin|date=2014}}</ref> Mondt left the promotion in the late 1960s and although the WWWF had previously withdrawn from the NWA, McMahon quietly re-joined in 1971.

The actual date of sale is still unknown but the generally accepted date is June 6, 1982; however this was likely only the date the deal was struck but not finalized. On WWF television, Capitol Wrestling Corporation maintained copyrights and ownership past the June 1982 date. The World Wrestling Federation was not solely owned by Vincent J. McMahon but also by [[Gorilla Monsoon]], [[Arnold Skaaland]] and Phil Zacko. The deal between the two McMahons was a monthly payment basis where if a single payment was missed, ownership would revert to the elder McMahon and his business partners. Looking to seal the deal quickly, McMahon took several loans and deals with other promoters and the business partners (including the promise of a job for life) in order to take full ownership by May or June 1983 for an estimated total of roughly $1 million with the three business partners receiving roughly $815,000 among them and Vincent J. McMahon receiving roughly $185,000.<ref>Death of the Territories: Expansion, Betrayal and the War that Changed Pro Wrestling Forever by Tim Hornbaker.

This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions, eventually ending the territory system, which was in use since the founding of the NWA in the 1940s. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters, to which McMahon discussed in an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. McMahon was quoted as saying: \"In the old days, there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country, each with its own little lord in charge. Each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord. No takeovers or raids were allowed. There were maybe 30 of these tiny kingdoms in the U.S. and if I hadn't bought out my dad, there would still be 30 of them, fragmented and struggling. I, of course, had no allegiance to those little lords.\"<ref name=si/>\n\nMcMahon gained significant traction when he hired [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) talent [[Hulk Hogan]], who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling, notably for his appearance in the film ''[[Rocky III]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0084602}}</ref> McMahon signed [[Roddy Piper]] as Hogan's rival, and then shortly afterward [[Jesse Ventura]] as an announcer. Other wrestlers joined the roster, such as [[The Iron Sheik]], [[Nikolai Volkoff]], [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Greg Valentine]], and [[Ricky Steamboat]], joining existing stars such as [[Jimmy Snuka]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Sgt Slaughter|Sgt. Slaughter]] and [[Andre The Giant]]. Many of the wrestlers who would later join the WWF were former AWA or NWA talent.\n\nThe WWF would tour nationally in a venture that would require a huge capital investment, one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse. The future of McMahon's experiment came down to the success or failure of McMahon's groundbreaking concept, [[WrestleMania]]. WrestleMania was a major success and was (and still is) marketed as the [[Super Bowl]] of professional wrestling. The concept of a wrestling [[Card (sports)|supercard]] was nothing new in North America; the NWA had begun running [[Starrcade]] a few years prior. In McMahon's eyes, however, what separated WrestleMania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling. He invited celebrities such as [[Mr. T]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Cyndi Lauper]] to participate in the event, as well as securing a deal with [[MTV]] to provide coverage. The event and hype surrounding it led to the term ''[[Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]'', due to the cross-promotion of [[popular culture]] and professional wrestling.\n\nThe WWF business expanded significantly on the shoulders of McMahon and his [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] hero Hulk Hogan for the next several years. The introduction of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on [[NBC]] in 1985 marked the first time that professional wrestling had been broadcast on network television since the 1950s when the now-defunct [[DuMont Television Network]] broadcast matches of Vincent J. McMahon's Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The 1980s \"Wrestling Boom\" peaked with the [[WrestleMania III]] pay-per-view at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1987, which set an attendance record of 93,173, a record that stood for 29 years until [[WrestleMania 32]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|title=Wrestlemania 32: Record and reputations tumble|access-date=March 15, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061259/https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|archive-date=October 7, 2016}}</ref> A rematch of the WrestleMania III main event between WWF champion Hulk Hogan and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] took place on ''[[The Main Event I]]'' in 1988 and was seen by 33 million people, the most-watched wrestling match in North American television history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat&nbsp;\u2013 Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM!

The steroid trial cost the company an estimated $5 million at a time of record low revenues.

During this period, the WWF promoted wrestlers of a younger age comprising \"The New Generation\", featuring [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]], [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], [[Bret Hart]], and [[The Undertaker]], in an effort to promote new talent into the spotlight.\n\nIn January 1993, the WWF debuted its flagship cable program ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''.
