The club was founded in 1887{{refn|group=nb|Although the club was \"formally constituted\" in 1887, no matches were played until 1888. The latter date is listed by the club as their foundation date; for example, on the club badge.}} with the purpose of alleviating poverty in the [[Irish-Scottish people|immigrant Irish]] population in the [[East End of Glasgow]]. They played their first match in May 1888, a friendly match against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] which Celtic won 5\u20132. Celtic established themselves within Scottish football, winning six successive league titles during the first decade of the 20th century. The club enjoyed their greatest successes during the 1960s and 70s under [[Jock Stein]], when they won nine consecutive league titles and the [[1967 European Cup Final|1967 European Cup]]. Celtic have played in green and white throughout their history, adopting hoops in 1903, which have been used ever since.\n\nCeltic are one of only five clubs in the world to have won over 100 trophies in their history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/gallery/ranked-30-most-successful-clubs-world-football-ever|title=Ranked!

Celtic also reached the [[1970 European Cup Final]] and the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final]], losing in both.\n\nCeltic have a long-standing fierce rivalry with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], and the clubs are known as the [[Old Firm]], seen by some as the world's biggest football derby. The club's [[Celtic F.C. supporters|fanbase]] was estimated in 2003 as being around nine million worldwide, and there are more than 160 Celtic supporters clubs in over 20 countries. An estimated 80,000 fans travelled to [[Seville]] for the 2003 UEFA Cup Final, and their \"extraordinarily loyal and sporting behaviour\" in spite of defeat earned the club [[FIFA Fair Play Award|Fair Play]] awards from [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Celtic F.C.
