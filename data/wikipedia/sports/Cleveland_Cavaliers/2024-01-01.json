The Cavaliers compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]] of the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]]. The team began play as an [[expansion team]] in [[1970\u201371 NBA season|1970]], along with the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and [[Buffalo Braves]]. Home games were first held at [[Cleveland Arena]] from 1970 to 1974, followed by the [[Richfield Coliseum]] from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at [[Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse]] in [[downtown Cleveland]], which is shared with the [[Cleveland Monsters]] of the [[American Hockey League]]. [[Dan Gilbert]] has owned the team since March 2005.\n\nThe Cavaliers opened their inaugural season by losing their first 15 games and struggled in their early years, placing no better than sixth in the Eastern Conference during their first five seasons. The team won their first Central Division title in 1976, which also marked the first winning season and playoff appearance in franchise history, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. The franchise was purchased by [[Ted Stepien]] in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and [[NBA draft|draft]] decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses. The Cavs went 66\u2013180 over the course of those three seasons and endured a 24-game losing streak spanning the 1981\u201382 and 1982\u201383 seasons.\n\nGeorge and [[Gordon Gund]] purchased the franchise in 1983. During the latter half of the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, the Cavs were a regular playoff contender \u2013 led by players such as [[Mark Price]] and [[Brad Daugherty (basketball)|Brad Daugherty]] \u2013 and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992. After the team's playoff appearance in the 1997\u201398 season, however, the Cavs had six consecutive losing seasons with no playoff action. Cleveland was awarded with the top overall pick in the [[2003 NBA draft|2003 draft]], and they selected [[LeBron James]]. Behind James and [[Zydrunas Ilgauskas]], the Cavaliers again became a regular playoff contender by 2005. They made their first appearance in the [[NBA Finals]] in [[2007 NBA Finals|2007]] after winning the first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history. After failing to return to the NBA Finals in the ensuing three seasons, James joined the [[Miami Heat]] in 2010. As a result, the Cavaliers finished the 2010\u201311 season last in the conference, enduring a 26-game losing streak, the [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|second-longest in NBA history]]. Between 2010 and 2014, however, the team won the top pick in the [[NBA draft lottery]] three times \u2013 first in [[2011 NBA draft|2011]] where they selected [[Kyrie Irving]], and again in [[2013 NBA draft|2013]] and [[2014 NBA draft|2014]].\n\nAfter four seasons with the Heat and having won back-to-back titles in the 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313 seasons, James returned to the Cavs in 2014 and led the team to four straight NBA Finals appearances. In [[2015\u201316 Cleveland Cavaliers season|2016]], the Cavaliers won their first [[NBA Championship]], marking [[Cleveland sports curse|Cleveland's first major sports title]] since 1964. The [[2016 NBA Finals]] victory over the [[2015\u201316 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing, 3\u20131. The Cavaliers have 23 playoff appearances and have won seven Central Division titles, five Eastern Conference titles and one NBA title.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Cleveland Cavaliers}}\nThe

The first jerseys featured the feathered treatment of the letter \"C\" in \"Cavaliers\". In 1974, they changed into the classic block lettering and checkerboard pattern that was synonymous to the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team of 1976. In 1980, the gold shade was changed from yellowish to metallic, and the uniforms removed the checkerboard pattern and placed the stripes above \"Cleveland\" and below the uniform number, the only time the city name was featured in both home and away jerseys.\n\nThe original logo was that of a swashbuckling cavalier looking right with a sword pointing, surrounded by the team name and a basketball. A modernized swashbuckling cavalier logo was later used by the Cavaliers' [[NBA Development League]] affiliate, the [[Canton Charge]]. The gold checkerboard uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2004\u201305 season to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team, while the gold \"feathered C\" uniforms were used again in the 2008\u201309 season as a buildup to the then-upcoming 40th season of the Cavaliers. The \"Miracle of Richfield\" gold uniforms were used again in the 2015\u201316 season on special \"Hardwood Classic\" nights to commemorate the Miracle of Richfield team's 40th-anniversary celebration.\n\n===Blue and orange===\nIn the 1983\u201384 season, the colors were changed to burnt orange, blue and white. The first Cavaliers uniform under the new scheme featured the Cavaliers logo (with a \"V\" in the shape of a hoop and circle above as basketball) in an arched pattern and the player name sewn onto the back shoulder as a patch, with orange being the primary color in both the away and home uniforms. However, in the 1987\u201388 season, orange was relegated as a secondary color, and blue was used instead as the primary for the away and home uniforms; minor changes in the 1989\u201390 season include the city name on the blue away uniforms. The drop shadows were also removed. The orange version of the uniform was used again in the 2006\u201307 and 2016\u201317 seasons, as part of the respective 20th and 30th anniversaries of the 1986\u201387 team.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=cavs|author=Cleveland Cavaliers|number=807597097721757696|date=December 10, 2016|title=The squad turned back the clock and turned up the offense in last night's #ALLinORANGE win at The Q.}}</ref> The blue versions were worn in the 2009\u201310 season as part of the franchise's 40th anniversary and as a tribute to the 1988\u201389 team.\n\n===Blue, black and orange===\nCoinciding with the move to Gund Arena in the 1994\u201395 season, the Cavaliers changed logos and uniforms, adding black in addition to the already existing blue, orange and white colors. The uniforms feature a blue splash in the abdomen area in front. From 1994 to 1997, the word \"CAVS\" on the home uniforms was orange with black lines, while the numbers are in black with white lines; \"CLEVELAND\" on the road uniforms was also orange with black lines, while the numbers are in white with a black line. From 1997 to 1999, the numbers and lettering were slightly tweaked: The word \"CAVS\" and the numbers on the home uniforms were black with orange lines, while the word \"CLEVELAND\" and the numbers on the road uniforms were white with orange lines. In the latter iteration, the blue splash was moved from the right leg to the left leg, surrounding \"CLEVELAND\" on the home uniforms and \"CAVS\" on the road uniforms, with a minor change in striping.\n\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, the Cavaliers opted to go for a cleaner look, eliminating the splash and adding an orange and blue line that runs through the shorts. The home jerseys feature the team nickname and the uniform numbers are in blue with black lines, while the away jerseys featured the city name and the uniform numbers in white with blue lines; these jerseys were used until the 2002\u201303 season. The logo used in this period was of a basketball on its way down a net, surrounded by a black square and the word \"CAVS\" in blue with black line below.\n\nThe 1994\u201396 black uniforms were revived for the 2019\u201320 season as part of the Cavaliers' 50th season, as well as the 25th anniversary of the move to Gund Arena (now Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse).<ref>{{cite news|title=Cavaliers To Debut Classic Edition Uniform, Two New Courts This Season|url=https://www.nba.com/cavaliers/releases/2019-classic-jersey|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=August 28, 2019|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Wine, metallic gold and navy===\nThe Cavaliers switched to a modified version of the team's classic wine-and-gold scheme in the 2003\u201304 season: metallic gold and a crimson shade of wine with navy blue added. The home uniform was white, with the word \"Cavaliers\" in wine lettering with gold trim on the front, the player's name in wine lettering with gold trim on the back, the player's numbers in navy blue, and wine-and-gold trim on the sides. The team's standard road uniform was wine-colored, with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as white and gold trim on the sides. The team's alternate jersey was navy blue with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as a wine, gold and navy blue checkerboard trim. The checkerboard trim was a tribute to the original Cavaliers uniforms from the 1970s.
