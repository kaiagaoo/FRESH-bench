The Suns are the only team in their division not to be based in [[California]]. They play their home games at the [[Footprint Center]].

Though their early years were mired in mediocrity, their fortunes changed in the 1970s after partnering [[Dick Van Arsdale]] and [[Alvan Adams]] with [[Paul Westphal]]. The team reached the [[1976 NBA Finals]], in what is considered to be one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.

However, the team would again fail to win a championship, and entered into another period of mediocrity until the early 2000s.\n\nIn 2004, the Suns signed free agent [[Steve Nash]] (who had blossomed for the [[Dallas Mavericks]] after being traded from Phoenix six years earlier), and returned into playoff contention. With Nash, [[Shawn Marion]], and [[Amar'e Stoudemire]], and under head coach [[Mike D'Antoni]], the Suns became renowned worldwide for their quick, dynamic offense, which led them to tie a franchise record in wins in the 2004\u201305 season.

They were the first [[Major professional sports teams of the United States and Canada|major professional sports franchise]] in the Phoenix market and in the entire state of Arizona, and remained the only one for the better part of 20 years (a [[Phoenix Roadrunners (WHA)|Phoenix Roadrunners]] team played in the [[World Hockey Association]] from 1974 to 1977) until the [[Arizona Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League]] relocated from [[St. Louis]] in 1988. The Suns played their first 24 seasons at [[Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum]], called the \"Madhouse on McDowell\", located slightly northwest of downtown Phoenix. The franchise was formed by an ownership group led by [[Karl Eller]], owner of a public enterprise, the investor Donald Pitt, Don Diamond, Bhavik Darji, Marvin Meyer, and [[Richard L. Bloch]]. Other owners with a minority stake consisted of entertainers, such as [[Andy Williams]], [[Bobbie Gentry]] and [[Ed Ames]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Murtha |first1=Tara |title=Ode to Billie Joe |date=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=New York, NY |isbn=9781623562212 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCihBQAAQBAJ&dq=%22bobbie+gentry%22+and+%22phoenix+suns%22&pg=PT22 |access-date=11 December 2021}}</ref> There were many critics, including then-NBA commissioner [[J.

Unlike the first-year success that Colangelo and Kerr had in Chicago, in which the Bulls finished with a first-year expansion record of 33 wins and a playoff berth (plus a [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|Coach of the Year]] award for Kerr), Phoenix finished its [[1968\u201369 Phoenix Suns season|first year]] at 16\u201366, and finished 25 games out of the final playoff spot.\n\nBoth Goodrich and Van Arsdale were selected to the [[1969 NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in their first season with the Suns. Goodrich returned to his former team, the Lakers, after two seasons with the Suns, but Van Arsdale spent the rest of his playing days as a Sun and a one-time head coach for Phoenix.\n\nThe Suns' last-place finish that season led to a coin flip for the number-one overall pick for the [[1969 NBA draft]] with the expansion-mate Bucks.

The next two seasons ([[1970\u201371 Phoenix Suns season|1970\u201371]] and [[1971\u201372 Phoenix Suns season|1971\u201372]]), the Suns finished with 48- and 49-win seasons, but did not qualify for the playoffs in either year, and did not reach the playoffs again until 1976. The major draw for the franchise in this era was the dramatic play of Connie Hawkins.\n\nThis era was also marked by the arrival of longtime Suns [[play-by-play]] and [[Curt Gowdy Media Award|Naismith Hall of Fame]] announcer [[Al McCoy (announcer)|Al McCoy]], hired by Jerry Colangelo before the start of the [[1972\u201373 NBA season]]. Soon locally renowned as \"the Voice of the Suns\", his broadcasts were [[simulcast]] on both [[television]] and [[radio]] from 1972 until 2003 when he became exclusive to the Suns Radio Network. He was still broadcasting Suns home games on radio as of the 2022\u201323 season, having called all three [[NBA Finals]] appearances for the franchise (in [[1976 NBA Finals|1976]], [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], and [[2021 NBA Finals|2021]]).\n\nColangelo called Al McCoy \"the greatest [[salesman]] for the game of basketball in our entire state.\"<ref name=\"McCoy's-Book\">{{cite book |last1=McCoy |first1=Al |last2=Wolfe |first2=Rich |title=The Real McCoy |date=2009 |publisher=Lone Wolfe Press |isbn=9780980097870}}</ref> \"He had as much to do with the success of the Suns as any player, coach or manager.\"<ref name=\"McCoy's-Book\" />\n\n====1975\u20131976: Trip to the NBA Finals====\nThe [[1975\u201376 Phoenix Suns season|1975\u201376 season]] proved to be a pivotal year for the Suns as they made several key moves, including the off-season trade of former All-Star guard [[Charlie Scott (basketball)|Charlie Scott]] to the [[Boston Celtics]] in exchange for guard [[Paul Westphal]], a member of Boston's [[1974 NBA Finals|1974 championship team]]. They also drafted center and eventual fan favorite [[Alvan Adams]] from the [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|University of Oklahoma]] and guard [[Ricky Sobers]] of [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels men's basketball|UNLV]]. The Suns and [[Buffalo Braves]] made a midseason trade, with Phoenix sending forward/center [[John Shumate]] to Buffalo in exchange for forward [[Garfield Heard]].\n\nPhoenix had an inconsistent regular season, starting out at 14\u20139 (then the best start in team history), then went 4\u201318 during a stretch where the team sustained several injuries (including [[Dick Van Arsdale]] breaking his right arm in a February game). The Suns then went 24\u201313 in the final 37 games to finish 42\u201340, clinching their first playoff spot since 1970. The Suns faced the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs, winning the series four games to two, and beat the defending NBA champion [[Golden State Warriors]] in the Western Conference finals, four games to three, to advance to their first NBA Finals.\n\n[[File:Paul Westphal 1975 press photo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Westphal]] led the Suns to their first-ever NBA Finals in 1976]]\nThe Suns faced an experienced Celtics team, led by eventual Hall of Famers [[Dave Cowens]], [[John Havlicek]] and [[Jo Jo White]]. Game five of the [[1976 NBA Finals]] took place at [[Boston Garden]], where the Suns came back from a 22-point first-half deficit to force overtime. Havlicek made what was supposed to be a game-winning basket, but due to fans rushing the floor before time officially expired, officials put one second back on the clock with Phoenix having possession of the ball, but under their own basket. Instead of attempting a desperation heave, the Suns' Westphal intentionally called a timeout that they did not have, a technical foul, giving the Celtics a free throw, which Jo Jo White converted to put them up 112\u2013110. However, this advanced the ball to half-court, and once the Suns had possession, [[Garfield Heard]] made a buzzer-beating turnaround jump shot to force a third overtime. The Suns' hard-fought battle was short-lived, as Boston's reserve player [[Glenn McDonald]] scored six of his eight points in the third overtime to lead the Celtics to a 128\u2013126 win. Boston eventually won the series in six games, clinching the championship at the Coliseum, defeating Phoenix in game six, 87\u201380.\n\n===1976\u20131988: From success to scandals===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Suns enjoyed several successful seasons including the 1981 Pacific Division title, making the playoffs eight seasons in a row including an appearance at the 1984 Western Conference finals. Problems arose on and off the court in the mid-1980s. In 1987, the [[Maricopa County]] Attorney's Office indicted 13 people on drug-related charges, three of whom were active Suns' players [[James Edwards (NBA)|James Edwards]], [[Jay Humphries]] and [[Grant Gondrezick]].

The scandal did provide an opening for general manager [[Jerry Colangelo]] to lead a group that bought the team from its owners for $44 million at the start of the 1987\u201388 season, a record at that time. With a drug scandal and the loss of promising young center [[Nick Vanos]], who was killed in the crash of [[Northwest Airlines Flight 255]], the franchise was in turmoil both on and off the court.\n\n[[File:Kevin Johnson.jpg|thumb|right|Kevin Johnson was the Suns' point guard for 11 seasons]]\n\n===1988\u20131992: The Kevin Johnson/Tom Chambers/Dan Majerle era===\nThe Suns' luck began to turn around in [[1987\u201388 Phoenix Suns season|1988]] with the acquisition of [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]] from the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], along with [[Mark West (basketball)|Mark West]] and [[Tyrone Corbin]], for All-Star [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Nance]] and Mike Sanders. This was the beginning of a franchise-record 13 consecutive playoff appearances. All-Star [[Tom Chambers (basketball)|Tom Chambers]] came over from the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] (the first unrestricted free agent in NBA history), [[1986 NBA draft|1986]] second-round draft pick [[Jeff Hornacek]] continued to develop, and \"Thunder\" [[Dan Majerle]] was drafted with the 14th pick in the [[1988 NBA draft|1988 draft]]. [[Kurt Rambis]] was added from the [[Charlotte Hornets]] in 1989, and the team upset the [[1989\u201390 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] in five games during the playoffs that season, before falling to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in the Western Conference finals. In [[1990\u201391 Phoenix Suns season|1990\u201391]], the Suns went 55\u201327 but lost in the first round to the [[Utah Jazz]], 3\u20131. In [[1991\u201392 Phoenix Suns season|1991\u201392]], the Suns went 53\u201329. Having sent four players to the All-Star Game in the previous two seasons (Chambers, Johnson, Hornacek, and Majerle), the Suns swept the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in three games in the first round of the [[1992 NBA playoffs]]. The Suns then were defeated in five games to the Trail Blazers in the conference semifinals. The series was punctuated by a game four in which the Suns lost in double overtime 153\u2013151 (the highest-scoring game in NBA playoff history to date).

They continued to bolster their roster by adding players such as [[A.C. Green]], [[Danny Manning]], [[Wesley Person]], [[Wayman Tisdale]], and [[Elliot Perry]]. Despite a Pacific Division title in 1995, the Suns were eliminated in consecutive Western Conference Semifinal rounds by the [[Houston Rockets]], both series going a full seven games. Manning was rarely at full strength with the Suns, injuring his [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] in 1995 just before the All-Star break. In both years, the Suns led the series by two games at one point (2\u20130 in 1994, 3\u20131 in 1995) only to see the Rockets come back to win each series.\n\nAt the end of the [[1994\u201395 Phoenix Suns season|1994\u201395 season]], Phoenix general manager [[Bryan Colangelo]], the son of Jerry, initiated an eventually costly trade,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} sending the All-Star Majerle and a first-round draft pick to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in exchange for [[John \"Hot Rod\" Williams]]. Majerle was a fan favorite in Phoenix and in the Suns' locker room.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The trade was made to address the Suns' need of a shot-blocking center but Majerle's presence was missed and Williams's production never met expectations.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe [[1995\u201396 Phoenix Suns season|1995\u201396 season]] was a disappointing year for the Suns, despite drafting [[NBA All-Rookie First Team]] member [[Michael Finley]], who became unavailable for the playoffs due to injury. The Suns posted a 41\u201341 record and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. Westphal was fired midway through the season and replaced by Fitzsimmons, his third stint as head coach. A combination of front office unrest, along with the dwindling possibility of winning a championship,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} led to turmoil in Barkley's relationship with Jerry Colangelo, who both spurned each other publicly. This led to Barkley being traded to Houston for [[Sam Cassell]], [[Robert Horry]], [[Mark Bryant (basketball)|Mark Bryant]], and [[Chucky Brown]]. Three of the four players were not with the franchise one year later, and two of the most talented players (Horry and Cassell) constantly clashed with the coach and seemed to be a negative influence in the locker room.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\n===1996\u20132004: Average times===\nIn the [[1996 NBA draft]], the Suns used their 15th pick for [[Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball|Santa Clara]] guard [[Steve Nash]]. Upon hearing the draft announcement, Suns fans booed in disapproval of the relatively unknown player, because he had not played in one of the major college conferences.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} During his first two seasons in the NBA, he played a supporting role behind star point guards [[Jason Kidd]] and [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]].\n\nAfter the Barkley trade, the Suns began the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]] 0\u201313, a franchise record for the worst start. During the 13-game losing streak, Fitzsimmons stepped down as the coach and was replaced by former player Danny Ainge.\n\nAfter an on-the-court altercation between Ainge and Horry, Horry was traded to the Lakers for former Sun and NBA all-star [[Cedric Ceballos]]. Cassell was later traded to Dallas for all-star guard [[Jason Kidd]]. With a mostly small lineup, the Suns put together an 11-game win streak that put them in [[1997 NBA playoffs|the playoffs as the seventh seed]], in a series that almost upset the favored Sonics. Despite the loss in the playoffs, the Suns became one of the few NBA teams to make the playoffs after starting the season 0\u201310 or worse,{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} and one of the few to make the playoffs after experiencing a 10-plus-game losing streak during the regular season.\n\nWith Kidd starting at point guard, Nash was traded to the Mavericks in June 1998 in exchange for [[Martin M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp]], [[Bubba Wells]], the draft rights to [[Pat Garrity]], and a future first-round draft pick (later used to select [[Shawn Marion]]).\n\nIn the off-season prior to the 2000 NBA season, the Suns traded for perennial All-Star [[Penny Hardaway|Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway]], creating the tandem of Kidd and Hardaway called \"Backcourt 2000\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2014/7/31/5954349/throwback-thursday-backcourt-2000|title=Throwback Thursday: Backcourt 2000|date=July 31, 2014|website=BrightSideOfTheSun.com|access-date=December 29, 2017|archive-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055329/https://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2014/7/31/5954349/throwback-thursday-backcourt-2000|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the combination of Hardaway and Kidd was never fully realized as Hardaway missed several games during the middle of the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]] and Kidd broke his ankle going into [[2000 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]] just as Hardaway returned to the court. As the Suns entered the 2000 playoffs, they beat the higher-seeded San Antonio Spurs 3\u20131 in the best-of-five series. The Spurs were without their best player Tim Duncan throughout the whole series. However, even with the return of Kidd in the next round, the Suns fell to the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in a 4\u20131 series.\n\nThe Suns continued to make the playoffs until the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]] when they fell short for the first time in 14 years. That season marked the trade of Jason Kidd, partly due to a publicized domestic violence episode,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} to the [[New Jersey Nets]] for [[Stephon Marbury]]. With the resultant high draft pick, the Suns were able to draft [[Amar'e Stoudemire]].\n\n[[File:Amar'e Stoudemire 00054226.jpg|thumb|right|The Suns drafted Amare Stoudemire in 2002; he would become a six-time All Star]]\nThe [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303]] campaign saw the emergence of Stoudemire, a graduate of [[Cypress Creek High School (Orlando, Florida)]]. He became the first high school-drafted player to win the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|NBA Rookie of the Year]] for the 2002\u201303 season, during which the Suns posted a record of 44\u201338 and returned to the playoffs. Marbury had a successful individual season, making the All-NBA Third Team and being selected for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. The Suns were eliminated in the first round once again by the San Antonio Spurs; a six-game series with the eventual NBA champions.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]], the Suns finished out of the playoffs with a 29\u201353 record. The Suns made a blockbuster mid-season trade sending Marbury and Hardaway to the [[New York Knicks]] for Antonio McDyess and a future first round pick that was later dealt to Denver.\n\n===2004\u20132012: The Steve Nash era===\n\n====2004\u20132006: Nash wins back-to-back MVPs====\n[[File:stevenash1.jpg|thumb|left|After Nash's return to Phoenix in 2004, they won 33 more games than they did the previous season.]]\nThe beginning of 2004 saw the departure of the face of Suns management since the team's inception, when [[Jerry Colangelo]] announced that the Phoenix Suns were to be sold to an investment group headed by San Diego-based business executive and Tucson native [[Robert Sarver]] for $401 million. The [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305]] season marked the Suns' return to the NBA's elite, finishing with the best record at 62\u201320, and tying a franchise record set by the 1992\u201393 team. They set a team record for greatest one-season improvement at 33 games.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} During the off-season, the Suns signed unrestricted free agent All-Star point guard [[Steve Nash]] from Dallas, who had formerly played for the Suns at the beginning of his career. Nash went on to win the [[NBA Most Valuable Player|MVP]] award that season. [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] and [[Shawn Marion]] were named All-Stars and first-year coach [[Mike D'Antoni]] was named [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|NBA Coach of the Year]].\n\nIn the [[2005 NBA playoffs]], Phoenix was the first seed in the Western Conference. The Suns swept the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], 4\u20130, and defeated the fourth-seeded [[Dallas Mavericks]] in the second round, 4\u20132, as Nash forced game six into overtime with a three-pointer in the closing seconds. In the Western Conference finals, the Suns played the [[San Antonio Spurs]], who won the series 4\u20131, ending Phoenix's season, partly due to [[Joe Johnson (basketball)|Joe Johnson]] missing the first two games of the series. Johnson went on to start the remaining games where he averaged 40 minutes per game and 18.3 points per game. The Suns lost the first two at home, as well as the following game in San Antonio to fall behind 3\u20130 in the series, before winning game four at San Antonio 111\u2013106. The team then lost game five at home 101\u201395 to be eliminated from the playoffs.

Shooting guard Joe Johnson also demanded a sign-and-trade deal to the [[Atlanta Hawks]], in which the Suns got [[Boris Diaw]] and two future first-round picks. Other acquisitions included [[Raja Bell]] and [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]]. Despite the turnover in players, the Suns again won the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]], going 54\u201328 and capturing the second seed in the Western Conference. Nash was awarded a second consecutive [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]], becoming the second point-guard, after [[Magic Johnson]], to win the award in consecutive seasons. Also, Diaw was named [[NBA Most Improved Player Award|NBA Most Improved Player]].\n\nThe Suns began the 2006 Western Conference Playoffs as favorites against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. After winning the first game in Phoenix, they found themselves trailing in the series 3\u20131 after impressive performances{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2017}} by Lakers' shooting guard [[Kobe Bryant]]. However, the Suns went on to win three straight games. With 7:33 left in the fifth game, Suns guard Raja Bell grabbed Bryant around the neck and threw him down as the Lakers' star drove to the basket. Bell earned a technical foul, his second of the game, and an automatic ejection. The Suns took game six in overtime, their first overtime win all season, despite 50 points from Bryant and Bell out serving a one-game suspension with last-second help from mid-season acquisition [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]]. On their home court, the Suns won game seven 121\u201390, eliminating the Lakers for the first time since 1993.

Some have attributed this to the mid-season acquisition of aging former MVP [[Shaquille O'Neal]] for four-time All Star Shawn Marion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2009/3/4/780023/revisting-the-marion-for-s|title={{sic|nolink=y|reason=error in source|Revisting}} the Marion for Shaq trade: A bloggers Round Table|date=March 4, 2009|website=BrightSideOfTheSun.com|access-date=December 29, 2017|archive-date=November 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109080818/https://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2009/3/4/780023/revisting-the-marion-for-s|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://valleyofthesuns.com/2009/06/29/the-shaq-trade-revisited/|title=The Shaq trade revisited|date=June 29, 2009|website=ValleyOfTheSuns.com|access-date=December 29, 2017|archive-date=November 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109080723/https://valleyofthesuns.com/2009/06/29/the-shaq-trade-revisited/|url-status=live}}</ref> Though O'Neal was brought in as a physical presence to match with the likes of the Spurs' [[Tim Duncan]], the move all but ended their fast-paced offense which had brought them to the cusp of a Finals appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/02/the-20-worst-trade-deadline-deals-in-nba-history/shaquille-oneal-to-the-suns|title=The 20 Worst Trade Deadline Deals in NBA History14.

Porter was an assistant coach of the [[Detroit Pistons]] when he was let go after the Pistons were eliminated by the [[Boston Celtics]] in the 2008 NBA Eastern Conference finals. During the off-season, the Suns had difficulties signing free agents because of being over the luxury tax. They made attempts to sign a backup point guard, [[Tyronn Lue]]; however, he decided to sign with the [[Milwaukee Bucks|Bucks]] for more money. The Suns selected [[Robin Lopez]] (15th overall pick out of [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]]) in the [[2008 NBA draft]] and acquired [[Goran Dragi\u0107]], who was originally picked by the rival [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\n[[File:Alvin Gentry cropped.JPG|thumb|right|Alvin Gentry coached the Suns to a Western Conference finals appearance in 2010.]]\nOn February 16, 2009, the Suns fired Porter and he was succeeded by [[Alvin Gentry]]. The Suns were expected to make the transition back to the up-tempo style basketball nicknamed the \"7 Seconds or Less\" or \"[[Run and gun (basketball)|Run and Gun]]\" style. On February 18, Gentry began his head coaching tenure with a 140\u2013100 win over the Clippers at home. Six Suns players scored in double digits, led by Leandro Barbosa's 24 points. The Suns led by as much as 50 points during the game and were without their swingman [[Jason Richardson]] who was serving a one-game suspension. However, this offense cost them their defense, allowing over 107 points per game, 27th in the league. The Suns scored 140 in the next two games. On February 20, Amar'e Stoudemire underwent eye surgery and was out for eight weeks. They went 18\u201313 under Gentry in the last 31 games. At the end of the season, the Suns missed the playoffs with a 46\u201336 record.\n\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, the Suns played a far more balanced style of basketball and finished with a 54\u201328 record. The Suns advanced to the NBA's Western Conference finals, eliminating the Portland Trail Blazers in six games and the San Antonio Spurs in four games, including an explosive performance by Goran Dragi\u0107 in game three against the Spurs, scoring 23 points in the fourth quarter. The Suns faced the Lakers in the Western Conference finals but lost in six games.\n\nOn June 15, 2010, Kerr resigned as general manager of the Suns and opted to return as an analyst for TNT effective June 30, 2010. In the wake of Kerr's decision to leave the club, senior vice president of basketball operations [[David Griffin (NBA executive)|David Griffin]] told managing partner Robert Sarver he did not want to be a candidate to replace Kerr and left when his contract expired on June 30. The last moves of both Steve Kerr and David Griffin were drafting players [[Gani Lawal]] and [[Dwayne Collins]] with the second-round draft picks that they had in the [[2010 NBA draft]].\n\n====2010\u20132012: Slow decline without Amar'e====\nThe Suns attempted to re-sign [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] in the 2010 free agency period with a five-year contract for around $95 million, with $71 million guaranteed, and the rest of his salary coming only if certain conditions were held, such as getting guaranteed 4th and 5th-season money if he remained healthy enough to meet those conditions. Stoudemire instead signed with the [[New York Knicks]] for $100 million.\n\nThe Suns hired player agent [[Lon Babby]] as president of basketball operations. The team then paid over $80 million to acquire [[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]], [[Josh Childress]], and [[Hakim Warrick]] to not only replace Stoudemire but also add bench depth. On August 5, 2010, the Suns hired [[Lance Blanks]] as general manager. On December 19, 2010, the Suns acquired [[Vince Carter]], [[Micka\u00ebl Pi\u00e9trus]], and [[Marcin Gortat]] from the [[Orlando Magic]], along with a low draft pick and cash considerations.<ref>{{cite news|last=McPeek|first=Jeramie|title=Suns, Magic Complete Six-Player Trade|url=http://www.nba.com/suns/news/orlando_trade_101218.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Suns.com|date=December 18, 2010|access-date=October 2, 2018|archive-date=April 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404193714/http://www.nba.com/suns/news/orlando_trade_101218.html|url-status=live}}</ref> For this acquisition, the Suns traded [[Jason Richardson]], [[Earl Clark]], and the recently acquired [[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]].

The Suns ended the 2010\u201311 season with a losing record and missed the playoffs.\n\nIn the [[2011 NBA draft]], the Suns used their 13th pick on [[Markieff Morris]], a 6' 10\" power forward from the [[Kansas Jayhawks]]. Markieff is the twin brother of [[Marcus Morris (basketball)|Marcus Morris]], who played together for three years in Kansas. In the [[2012 NBA draft]], the Suns used their 13th pick to select [[Kendall Marshall]], a 6' 4\" point guard from the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]].

After the trade, the Suns then re-acquired point guard [[Goran Dragi\u0107]] from Houston, signed [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] forward [[Michael Beasley]], and claimed Houston forward [[Luis Scola]] off amnesty waivers while also using the same [[amnesty clause]] (as codified in the [[2011 NBA lockout|2011 collective bargaining agreement]]) to waive [[Josh Childress]]. They also did a three-way trade with the [[New Orleans Hornets]] and the Timberwolves by trading [[Robin Lopez]] and [[Hakim Warrick]] to the Hornets and a 2014 second-rounder to the Timberwolves in exchange for [[Wesley Johnson (basketball)|Wesley Johnson]], a top 14-protected future first-rounder and the rights to [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Brad Miller]] and [[Jerome Dyson]]. The latter two players' rights were later waived and the Suns then signed [[Jermaine O'Neal]] for one year. The Suns also signed [[P. J. Tucker]] based on his performance with the Suns' Summer League team. On September 20, it was announced that [[Channing Frye]] had [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] and as a result, he missed the entire [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]], although he sometimes made special appearances to do the pre-game show for local Suns games with Tom Leander and [[Tom Chambers (basketball)|Tom Chambers]]. On January 12, 2013, the Suns became the fourth-fastest NBA team to win 2,000 games with a 97\u201381 road victory against the [[Chicago Bulls]], which also marked the last victory for Alvin Gentry as head coach for the Suns. On January 18, 2013, the day after a loss that broke a 24-home-game winning streak against the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], Gentry agreed to leave the Phoenix Suns organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/8857447/the-phoenix-suns-parted-ways-coach-alvin-gentry|title=Suns, coach Alvin Gentry part ways|publisher=ESPN|date=January 18, 2013|access-date=January 18, 2013|archive-date=January 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118184913/http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/8857447/the-phoenix-suns-parted-ways-coach-alvin-gentry|url-status=live}}</ref> Two days later, player development coach [[Lindsey Hunter]] was named interim head coach role for the remainder of the season.
