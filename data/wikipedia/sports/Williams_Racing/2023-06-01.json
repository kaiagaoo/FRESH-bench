It was founded by [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] and [[Patrick Head]]. The team was formed in {{F1|1977}} after Frank Williams' earlier unsuccessful F1 operation: [[Frank Williams Racing Cars]] (which later became [[Frank Williams Racing Cars#Wolf\u2013Williams Racing (1976)|Wolf\u2013Williams Racing]] in 1976).\n\nThe team's first race was the [[1977 Spanish Grand Prix]], where the new team ran a [[March Engineering|March]] chassis for [[Patrick N\u00e8ve]]. Williams started manufacturing its own cars the following year, and [[Clay Regazzoni]] won Williams' first race at the [[1979 British Grand Prix]]. At the [[1997 British Grand Prix]], [[Jacques Villeneuve]] scored the team's 100th race victory, making Williams one of only four teams in Formula One, alongside [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[McLaren]], and [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] to win 100 races. Williams won nine [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championships]] between {{F1|1980}} and {{F1|1997}}. This was a record until [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] won its tenth championship in {{F1|2000}}.\n\nNotable drivers for Williams include: [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]], [[Keke Rosberg]], [[Nigel Mansell]], [[Damon Hill]], [[David Coulthard]], [[Jenson Button]], [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], [[Alain Prost]], [[Nelson Piquet]], [[Ayrton Senna]], [[Riccardo Patrese]] and [[Jacques Villeneuve]]. Of these drivers, Jones, Rosberg, Mansell, Hill, Piquet, Prost, and Villeneuve won the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' title]] with the team. Of those who have won the championship with Williams, only Jones, Rosberg and Villeneuve defended their title while still with the team; as Piquet moved to [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] after winning the {{f1|1987}} championship; Mansell left F1 to compete in the [[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART]] series after winning the {{f1|1992}} championship, Prost retired after winning the {{f1|1993}} championship, and Hill moved to [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] after winning the {{f1|1996}} championship. None of Williams' Drivers' Champions went on to win a championship with another team.\n\nWilliams have worked with many engine manufacturers, most successfully with [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]], winning five of their nine Constructors' titles with the company. Along with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[McLaren]], [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] and [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]], Williams is one of a group of five teams that won every Constructors' Championship between 1979 and 2008 and every Drivers' Championship from 1984 to 2008.\n\nWilliams also has business interests beyond Formula One. They have established Williams Advanced Engineering and Williams Hybrid Power, who take technology originally developed for Formula One and adapt it for commercial applications. In April 2014, Williams Hybrid Power was sold to [[GKN]].\n\nIn May 2020, Williams announced they were seeking buyers for a portion of the team due to poor financial performance in 2019 and that they had terminated the contract of title sponsor ROKiT. On 21 August 2020, Williams was acquired by Dorilton Capital.\n\nFrank and [[Claire Williams]] stepped down from being Manager and Deputy Manager of the team on 6 September 2020, with the [[2020 Italian Grand Prix]] being their last time in their respective positions.<ref>{{Cite web|date=3 September 2020|title=Williams family to step aside from running of the team after Italian GP|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.breaking-williams-family-to-step-aside-from-running-of-the-team-after.2Ss3rwUeVit4NJ3XR6oLDn.html|access-date=2020-09-03|website=www.formula1.com|language=en}}</ref>\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Origins==\n{{see also|Frank Williams Racing Cars|Walter Wolf Racing}}\n[[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] founded Williams in 1977 after his previous team, [[Frank Williams Racing Cars]], failed to achieve the success he desired. Despite the promise of a new owner, Canadian millionaire [[Walter Wolf]], and the team's rebranding as Wolf\u2013Williams Racing in {{F1|1976}}, the cars still were not competitive. Eventually, Williams left the rechristened [[Walter Wolf Racing]] and moved to [[Didcot]] to rebuild his team as Williams Grand Prix Engineering. Frank recruited [[Patrick Head]] to work for the team, creating the Williams\u2013Head partnership.<ref name=\"Williams GP.com\">{{cite web|title=Williams F1 profile|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/con-willi.html|publisher=GrandPrix.com|access-date=9 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Racing history&nbsp;\u2013 Formula One==\n===Ford-Cosworth engines (1977\u20131983)===\n{{See also|Ford Motor Company|Cosworth}}\n[[File:Williams logo (old).png|thumb|The original Williams logo]]\n\n====1977 season====\nWilliams entered a [[March 761]] for the {{F1|1977}} season. Lone driver [[Patrick N\u00e8ve]] competed in 11 races that year, starting with the {{F1 GP|1977|Spanish}}. The new team failed to score a point, achieving a best finish of 7th at the {{F1 GP|1977|Italian}}.<ref>''Williams Grand Prix Engineering&nbsp;\u2013 1977 results'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008010930/http://www.f1db.com/exec/section/team/action/results/id/1977030/type/entries www.f1db.com]. Retrieved 22 August 2006.</ref>\n\n====1978 season====\n[[File:Williams FW06.jpg|thumb|left|The 1978 [[Williams FW06]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] in 2007]]\n\nFor the {{F1|1978}} season, Patrick Head designed the first Williams car: the FW06. Williams signed [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]], who had won the {{F1 GP|1977|Austrian}} the previous season for a devastated [[Shadow Racing Cars|Shadow]] team following the death of their lead driver, [[Tom Pryce]]. Jones's first race for the team was the {{F1 GP|1978|Argentine}} where he qualified in 14th position but retired after 36 laps due to a fuel system failure. The team scored its first championship points two races later at the {{F1 GP|1978|South African}} when Jones finished in fourth. Williams earnt their first podium at the {{F1 GP|1978|United States}}, where Jones came second, 20 seconds behind the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] of [[Carlos Reutemann]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Grand Prix Results: United States GP, 1978|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr312.html|publisher=GrandPrix.com|access-date=13 November 2006}}</ref> Williams finished the season in ninth place in the Constructors' Championship, with a respectable 11 points, while Alan Jones finished 11th in the Drivers' Championship. Towards the end of 1978, Frank Williams recruited [[Frank Dernie]] to join Patrick Head in the design office.\n\n====1979 season====\nHead designed the [[Williams FW07|FW07]] for the {{F1|1979}} season with Frank Dernie picking up the aerodynamic development and skirt design. This was the team's first [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] car, a technology that was first introduced by [[Colin Chapman]] and [[Team Lotus]]. Williams also obtained membership of the [[Formula One Constructors' Association]] (FOCA) which expressed a preference for teams to run two cars, so Jones was joined at the team by [[Clay Regazzoni]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Maurice|title=Frank Williams|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-333-71716-3|page=80}}</ref> It was not until the seventh round of the championship, the {{F1 GP|1979|Monaco}}, that they finished in the points. Regazzoni came close to taking the team's first win but finished second, less than a second behind race winner [[Jody Scheckter]]. The next race, the [[1979 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]], is remembered for the final lap battle between [[Ren\u00e9 Arnoux]] and [[Gilles Villeneuve]], but also saw both cars finish in the points for the first time; as Jones was fourth with Regazzoni in sixth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Prix Results: French GP, 1979|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr321.html|publisher=GrandPrix.com|access-date=9 June 2012}}</ref> The team's first win came at the {{F1 GP|1979|British}} (their home Grand Prix) when Regazzoni finished 25 seconds ahead of second place.\n\nGreater success followed when Williams got a 1-2 finish at the next round in [[1979 German Grand Prix|Germany]], Jones in first with Regazzoni two seconds behind in second. Jones then made it three wins in a row at the [[1979 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]], finishing half a minute ahead of Gilles Villeneuve's Ferrari. Three wins in a row became four two weeks later at the [[1979 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch Grand Prix]], with Alan Jones winning yet again by a comfortable margin over [[Jody Scheckter]]'s Ferrari. Scheckter ended Williams' winning streak when he won the {{F1 GP|1979|Italian}}; with Regazzoni finishing third behind Scheckter and Villeneuve. Alan Jones managed another win at the penultimate race in [[1979 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]] to cap off a great season.\n\nWilliams had greatly improved their Constructors' Championship position, finishing eight places higher than the previous year and scoring 59 more points. Alan Jones was the closest driver to the Ferrari duo of Villeneuve and 1979 champion Jody Scheckter. Jones scored 43 points, 17 points behind Scheckter, while Regazzoni was two places behind him with 32 points.\n<!--Alan Jones was the closest driver to the Ferrari duo of Villeneuve and 1979 champion Jody Scheckter, the Australian scored 43 points, 17 behind the South African, while Jones's teammate, Regazzoni, was two places behind him with 32 points.-->\n\n====1980 season====\nBefore the start of the 1980 season, Regazzoni left the team. So, [[Carlos Reutemann]] joined the team. Williams started strong in the championship, with Jones winning the first race of the season in [[1980 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]]. Jones won four more races: the [[1980 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]], the [[1980 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], the [[1980 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]] and, the last race of the season, the [[1980 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]]. Jones became the first of seven Williams drivers to win the Drivers' Championship, 17 points ahead of [[Nelson Piquet]]'s [[Brabham]]. Williams also won its first Constructors' Championship, scoring 120 points, almost twice as many as second-placed [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]].\n\n====1981 season====\nWilliams won four races in {{F1|1981}}. Alan Jones won the first race of the season, the [[1981 United States Grand Prix West|United States West Grand Prix]], and the final race of the season, the [[1981 Caesars Palace Grand Prix|Caesars Palace Grand Prix]]. Meanwhile, Carlos Reutemann won the [[1981 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]] and the [[1981 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]]. Williams won the Constructors' title for the second year in a row, scoring 95 points, 34 points more than second-placed Brabham.\n\n====1982 season====\n[[File:Williams F1 Main Article.jpg|thumb|[[Keke Rosberg]]'s [[Williams FW08|FW08]] used during the {{F1|1982}} season when Rosberg won the Drivers' Championship recording only a single win during the season]]\n\nThis season, Alan Jones retired from Formula One (though he would come back a year later for a single race with the [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] team). The Australian was replaced by [[Keke Rosberg]], the father of [[2016 Formula One World Championship|2016]] World Champion [[Nico Rosberg]]. Rosberg had not scored a single point the previous year. He won the Drivers' title that year despite winning only one race, the {{F1 GP|1982|Swiss}}. Rosberg's teammate, [[Carlos Reutemann|Reutemann]], finished in 15th place having quit Formula One after just two races of the new season. His seat was filled by [[Mario Andretti]] for the [[1982 United States Grand Prix West|United States Grand Prix West]]; before [[Derek Daly]] took over for the rest of the year. Williams finished fourth in the Constructors' Championship that year, 16 points behind first-place [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].\n\n===Honda engines (1983\u20131987)===\n{{main|Honda in Formula One}}\n\n====1983 season====\nFrank Williams looked towards Honda, who was developing a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] V6 engine with [[Spirit (racing team)|Spirit]]. A deal between Honda and Williams was settled early in 1983 and the team used the engines for the 1984 season. For the {{F1|1983}} season however, Williams continued to use the Ford engine except for the last race of the year in [[1983 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]]; where [[Keke Rosberg]] finished in an impressive fifth place. The team finished fourth in the Constructors' Championship, scoring 36 points. Also, Rosberg won that year's {{F1 GP|1983|Monaco}}.\n\n====1984 season====\nFor the {{F1|1984}} season, the team ran an [[Williams FW09|FW09]]. Keke Rosberg won the [[1984 Dallas Grand Prix|Dallas Grand Prix]] and finished in second at the opening race in [[1984 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]]. Rosberg's new teammate, [[Jacques Laffite]], came 14th in the Drivers' Championship with five points. The team finished sixth in the Constructors' with 25.5 points, with Rosberg finishing in eighth in the Drivers' Championship.\n\n====1985 season====\n[[File:Mansell - Williams 1985.jpg|thumb|[[Nigel Mansell]]'s Williams FW10 used during the {{F1|1985}} season]]\nIn {{F1|1985}}, [[Patrick Head|Head]] designed the [[Williams FW10|FW10]], the team's first chassis to employ the [[carbon fibre-reinforced polymer|carbon-fibre composite]] technology pioneered by McLaren. [[Nigel Mansell]] replaced Laffite to partner with Rosberg. The team scored four wins with Rosberg winning the [[1985 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit]] and [[1985 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grands Prix]], and Mansell won the {{F1 GP|1985|European}} and the {{F1 GP|1985|South African}}. Williams finished in third in the Constructors' Championship, scoring 71 points.\n\nDuring qualifying for the {{F1 GP|1985|British}}, Rosberg completed a lap of the circuit in 1:05.591. The lap's average speed was {{convert|160.938|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. This was the fastest recorded lap in Formula One history to that point.\n\nFrom 1985 until 1993, Williams ran their famous yellow, blue and white [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] livery.\n\n====1986 season====\nIn March 1986, Frank Williams faced the most serious challenge of his life. While returning to the airport at [[Nice]], France, after pre-season testing, he was involved in a road accident that left him paralysed. He did not return to the pit lane for almost a year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Maurice|title=Frank Williams|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-333-71716-3|pages=148\u2013153}}</ref> Despite the lack of his trackside presence, the Williams team won nine Grands Prix and the Constructors' Championship and came close to winning the Drivers' Championship with Nigel Mansell, but the British driver's left-rear tyre blew at the {{F1 GP|1986|Australian}}, the final race of the season, while his fellow championship rival and new teammate, Nelson Piquet made a pitstop shortly after Mansell's retirement as a precaution. This left [[Alain Prost]] to defend his title successfully, despite being in a slower car.\n\n====1987 season====\n[[File:Williams FW11B Honda.jpg|thumb|[[Nelson Piquet]]'s championship-winning [[Williams FW11|FW11B]] from {{F1|1987}} was the only Honda-powered Williams to win a Drivers' Championship]]\n\nThe {{F1|1987}} season brought the Williams-Honda partnership its first and only Drivers' Championship title in the hands of [[Nelson Piquet]]. Piquet won three races and scored 73 points in the Drivers' Championship. His teammate [[Nigel Mansell|Mansell]] came in second place with six victories and 61 points. Williams won the Constructors' Championship for the second year in a row, scoring 137 points, 61 points ahead of their nearest rivals, McLaren. Despite this success, Honda ended their partnership with Williams at the end of the year in favour of McLaren.\n\n===Judd engines (1988)===\n====1988 season====\nUnable to make a deal with another major engine manufacturer, Williams used [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] [[Judd (engine)|Judd engines]] for the {{F1|1988}} season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv-f1.com/Feature.aspx?Type=Photo_Features&PO_ID=36777|title=ITV-F1.com: WilliamsF1 Highs And Lows|work=ITV F1|publisher=ITV|date=15 January 2007|access-date=15 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092127/http://www.itv-f1.com/Feature.aspx?Type=Photo_Features&PO_ID=36777 |archive-date=29 September 2007}}</ref> This left them with a significant performance deficit compared with their turbo-powered rivals. [[Nelson Piquet|Piquet]] left Williams to join [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] who had retained their [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] engines for the 1988 season, helped by having [[Satoru Nakajima]] as number 2 driver to Piquet. Williams brought in [[Riccardo Patrese]] to replace Piquet. The team did not win a race that season and finished seventh in the Constructors' Championship, scoring 20 points. The highlights of the season for the team were two second-place finishes by Mansell. When Mansell was forced to miss two races due to illness, he was replaced by [[Martin Brundle]] for the first race and [[Jean-Louis Schlesser]] for the second.\n\n===Renault engines (1989\u20131997)===\n{{main|Renault in Formula One}}\n\nThe team secured [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] as their engine supplier in 1989. Renault engines subsequently powered Williams' drivers to another four Drivers' and five Constructors' Championships up until Renault's departure from Formula One at the end of 1997. The combination of Renault's powerful engine and [[Adrian Newey]]'s designing expertise led to the team dominating the sport in the mid-1990s alongside McLaren. Mansell had a record-breaking 1992 season, winning the title in record time and leading numerous races from pole to finish. Some maintain that Williams' [[Williams FW14|FW14]] and FW15 were \"the most technologically advanced cars that will ever race in Formula One\".<ref>{{cite news|title=The changing face of F1|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/cars_guide/4272031.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=28 February 2005|access-date=12 July 2006}}</ref>\n\n====1989 season====\n[[File:WilliamsFW12PatreseExhSinsheim.JPG|thumb|[[Williams FW12C]], the first powered by a Renault engine]]\nThe Renault era started in {{F1|1989}}, with [[Riccardo Patrese]] and [[Thierry Boutsen]] at the helm of the two Williams cars. Boutsen replaced Mansell, who had signed a contract with Ferrari. The engine's first Grand Prix in [[1989 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] was one that the team would prefer to forget: Boutsen retired with an engine failure and Patrese with an alternator failure. Williams managed to get back on track with Boutsen finishing in fourth at the next race in [[1989 San Marino Grand Prix|Italy]]; winning the team three points. Two races later at the [[1989 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]], the team managed to achieve their first podium with the Renault engine, as Patrese finished second, 15 seconds behind [[Ayrton Senna]]<nowiki/>in first. The next race saw Patrese finish second again, having started from 14th on the grid, with Boutsen finishing in 6th. At the sixth round in [[1989 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], Williams not only scored their first win with the Renault engine but also their first one-two: with Boutsen finishing in first followed by Patrese in second. This won the team 15 points. Williams came second in the Constructors' Championship, scoring 77 points, 64 points behind McLaren. Patrese finished 3rd in the Drivers' Championship with 40 points, 41 points behind second-placed [[Alain Prost]]. Boutsen finished 5th in the championship with 37 points after also winning in [[1989 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]]. Boutsen's win gave Williams the distinction of having won both the first and last Grand Prix of the 1980s.\n\n====1990 season====\nIn the {{F1|1990}} season, Williams kept [[Riccardo Patrese|Patrese]] and [[Thierry Boutsen|Boutsen]] as the team's drivers. The team scored 20 fewer points than the previous year and finished fourth in the Constructors' Championship two positions lower than in 1989. In the Drivers' Championship, Boutsen finished sixth with 34 points and Patrese in seventh with 23 points.\n\n====1991 season====\n[[File:Mansell and Senna at Silverstone cropped.jpg|thumb|[[1991 British Grand Prix]] winner Nigel Mansell giving Ayrton Senna a lift back to the Silverstone paddock after Senna had run out of fuel]]\nBoutsen left Williams and joined [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] at the start of the {{F1|1991}} season. Replacing him was a returning [[Nigel Mansell]], who had spent the previous two seasons driving for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Williams also recruited future 1996 world champion, [[Damon Hill]], as their reserve driver. Williams failed to finish the first Grand Prix of the season, the [[1991 United States Grand Prix|US Grand Prix]], with both drivers retiring due to gearbox problems. Patrese got back on track for the team in the next Grand Prix at [[1991 Brazilian Grand Prix|Interlagos]], coming second behind McLaren's [[Ayrton Senna]]. The [[1991 San Marino Grand Prix]] saw both cars retiring yet again: with Mansell crashing and Patrese suffering from an electrical failure. The [[1991 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] saw Mansell finish in the points, coming in second. At the next race, the [[1991 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]], Williams locked out the front row only for Patrese to drop back with gearbox problems and Mansell to retire from the lead on the final lap due to an electrical fault. At the following race in [[1991 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]], Williams achieved a 1\u20132 finish, with Patrese finishing in first and Mansell finishing in second. Williams then ran a streak of victories, with Mansell winning the [[1991 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]], five seconds ahead of [[Alain Prost]]'s [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Mansell then won again at the [[1991 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]]; it had been four years since a Briton had won the Grand Prix, Mansell having won it in [[1987 British Grand Prix|1987]]. Three consecutive victories became four when Mansell won again in [[1991 German Grand Prix|Germany]], with Patrese about 10 seconds behind him in second place. Senna ended Williams's run of victories by winning in [[1991 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], finishing five seconds ahead of Mansell. Mansell later won the [[1991 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] and the [[1991 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], while Patrese won the [[1991 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese Grand Prix]] after Mansell's race was ruined by a botched pitstop in which only three wheel nuts were fitted. Williams finished second in the Constructors' Championship, scoring 125 points in total, 14 points behind McLaren. Mansell finished second in the Drivers' Championship with 72 points, 24 points behind Senna.\n\n====1992 season====\n[[File:Williams FW14B.jpg|thumb|[[Nigel Mansell]]'s [[Williams FW14]]B used for the {{F1|1992}} season when he won the Drivers' Championship and the team won the Constructors' Championship]]\n\nWilliams took a step up for the {{F1|1992}} season, keeping their {{F1|1991}} driver line-up of [[Riccardo Patrese|Patrese]] and [[Nigel Mansell|Mansell]]. Mansell dominated the first round in [[1992 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]], qualifying in pole position and winning the race by 24 seconds from his teammate, Patrese. Nigel Mansell won the next four rounds for Williams, at [[1992 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico City]], [[1992 Brazilian Grand Prix|Interlagos]], [[1992 Spanish Grand Prix|Catalunya]] and [[1992 San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]], Patrese coming second in all but one (the Spanish Grand Prix at Catalunya, where he retired after spinning off). Mansell's five victories in the opening five races was a new record in Formula One. Senna won the next race in [[1992 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], ahead of both Williams cars, which finished second and third. In the next race, in [[1992 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], both Williams cars retired: Mansell spun off on entering the final corner (he claimed that Senna pushed him off) and Patrese had a gearbox failure. Mansell went on to record four more Grand Prix wins, including at the [[1992 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]]. (In the final round, in [[1992 Australian Grand Prix|Adelaide]], the two Williams cars again retired, Mansell after Senna violently crashed into the back of him, and Patrese with electrical problems.) Williams won the Constructors' Championship with 164 points, 65 points more than second-place McLaren. Mansell became World Champion, scoring 108 points, with Patrese finishing second with 56 points. Placing first in nine races, Mansell had set a new record for the most wins by a single driver in one year. Despite this, there looked to be significant upheaval at Williams for 1993; what followed led to a domino effect that had not only effects on the World Championship, but also the [[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART]]-sanctioned [[Champ Car World Series|PPG IndyCar Series]]. \n\n=====1992 off-season=====\nWilliams was interested in signing Alain Prost  to drive one of its two cars for 1993 as he was returning from his year long sabbatical after being sacked by Scuderia Ferrari during the 1991 World Championship. Patrese, perhaps figuring that he would be the driver being sacked in order for Prost to take one of the two available rides, decided to leave after driving for Williams since 1987. He would join up with Benetton, where he would replace [[Martin Brundle]] alongside [[Michael Schumacher]] in the team\u2019s [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]]-backed Fords. \n\nMansell, meanwhile, was not pleased that Williams was looking to bring Prost aboard. Prost and [[Gerhard Berger]] had essentially swapped rides after the 1989 season with Prost becoming Mansell's teammate at Ferrari. The acrimonious relationship between the two that ensued nearly resulted in Mansell retiring from the sport altogether and he had not forgotten this; as such, Mansell began looking for other options to continue his racing career. He eventually decided to move over to CART, where he paired with [[Mario Andretti]] at [[Newman/Haas Racing]].\n\nThat seat, meanwhile, had opened up because Andretti\u2019s son, [[Michael Andretti|Michael]], was leaving CART to replace Berger at McLaren. McLaren also was potentially dealing with losing a driver, as Ayrton Senna\u2019s contract had expired following the 1992 season. In addition to this, McLaren\u2019s arrangement with Honda to provide engines had also expired, and the team had signed to run Ford engines for 1993. With McLaren having fallen behind Williams on the grid, combined with his uncertainty regarding the new engine supplier, Senna approached Williams and offered to take over the second car. His interest was such that he was willing to drive for Williams while collecting no salary. \n\nHowever, like with Mansell, Prost had a rather testy relationship with Senna from when the two were teammates and rivals at McLaren in the 1980s. As such, he negotiated a two-year contract with Williams that gave him the power to approve or disapprove any driver Williams would seek to have him team with for 1993. Once the contract was signed, Prost used that power to freeze Senna out of driving for Williams; he would return to McLaren for one more season with the team running Ford engines. \n\nNeeding a replacement, Williams decided not to pursue any of the available drivers such as Berger and Brundle. Instead, they chose to promote former [[Brabham]] driver [[Damon Hill]], who had been their test driver since Brabham collapsed and folded during the 1992 season, to join Prost in the other Renault.\n\n====1993 season====\nThe [[Williams FW15C]] was an extremely dominant car, with active suspension and traction control systems beyond anything available to the other teams.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saward|first=Jow|title=Frank Williams Interview|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00150.html|publisher=GrandPrix.com|date=1 July 1993|access-date=14 July 2006|archive-date=30 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130211028/http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00150.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Prost won on his debut for the team in [[1993 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]] and, like Mansell, dominated the weekend, taking pole position and finishing a minute ahead of [[Ayrton Senna|Senna]], who was second. The next Grand Prix in [[1993 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] saw Prost collide with Christian Fittipaldi's Minardi in the rain on lap 29, while Hill went on to his first podium finish: second, 16 seconds behind Senna. Prost won three of the next four Grands Prix for Williams, Senna winning the other race. Prost and Hill later scored a 1\u20132 in [[1993 French Grand Prix|France]]: the only 1\u20132 of the season for Williams. Prost won the next two Grands Prix at [[1993 British Grand Prix|Silverstone]] and [[1993 German Grand Prix|Hockenheim]]. Hill proved competitive especially in the second half of the season. Mechanical problems cost Hill leads in Britain and Germany, but he went on to win the next three Grands Prix at [[1993 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], [[1993 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]] and [[1993 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]] which moved him to second in the standings, as well as giving him a chance of taking the Drivers' title. After Italy, Williams would not win a Grand Prix for the rest of the season, as a young [[Michael Schumacher]] won the following race in [[1993 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]], and Senna took [[1993 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] and [[1993 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]] to overtake Hill in the points. Williams retained their Constructors' title, 84 points ahead of second-placed McLaren. Prost clinched the Drivers' Championship in Portugal and finished the season 26 points ahead of second-placed Senna.\n\nBased on his victory in the 1992 World Championship, Mansell would have been issued car number 1 for the 1993 season, and his teammate issued number 2. However, Mansell's move to the IndyCar series meant that number 1 was not issued; instead, the team was issued the number 0, which was placed on Hill's car, while Prost was issued number 2.\n\n1993 marked the final season that Williams ran with Canon as its primary backer.\n\n====1994 season====\n[[File:Williams FW16.jpg|thumb|[[Williams FW16]]B used in the second half of the 1994 season when [[Rothmans International|Rothmans]] debuted as the team's primary backer]]\nDuring the {{F1|1994}} season, Williams used FW16 (developed during the pre-season) and FW16B (with shorter sidepods and optimised for the revised floor regulations which were introduced during the season).\n\nAfter Canon left the team Williams signed a contract with tobacco company [[Rothmans International]] for {{F1|1994}}, and their namesake brand became its primary sponsor from 1994 to {{F1|1997}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Manishin|first=Glenn|title=After Tamburello|url=http://f1-grandprix.com/?page_id=1796|work=F1-Grandprix.com|access-date=13 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nDespite Prost\u2019s continued unwillingness to have his former McLaren teammate run with him, pressure from various sources including the team\u2019s new sponsor led Williams to agree to terms with Ayrton Senna for 1994. The veto power in Prost\u2019s contract was only in effect for the 1993 season, and since Williams was now free to do as it desired and that Senna was again a free agent, the team decided it would bring in the multi-time former champion. To appease Prost, who decided to retire from racing permanently after Senna\u2019s signing, Williams agreed to pay him his full salary for the second half of the contract. \n\nGiven this was the same team that had won the previous two World Championships with vastly superior cars, Senna was a natural and presumptive pre-season title favourite, with second-year driver [[Damon Hill]] intended to play the supporting role. Between them, Prost, Senna, and Hill had won every race in 1993 but one, which was taken by Benetton's [[Michael Schumacher]].\n\nAs with 1993, Williams' cars were issued numbers 0 and 2, following Prost's victory in the 1993 championship and subsequent retirement.  Hill retained the number 0, while Senna's car was issued number 2.\n\nPre-season testing showed the [[Williams FW16|FW16]] had speed but was difficult to drive. The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) had banned electronic driver's aids, such as [[active suspension]], [[traction control system|traction control]] and [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], to make the sport more \"human\". It was these technological advancements that the Williams chassis of the previous years had been built around. With their removal in 1994, Williams had not been a good-handling car, as observed by other F1 drivers, having been seen to be very loose at the rear. Senna himself had made numerous comments that the [[Williams FW16]] had quirks that needed to be ironed out. It was obvious that the FW16, after the regulation changes banning active suspension and traction control, exhibited none of the superiority of the [[Williams FW15C|FW15C]] and [[Williams FW14]]B cars that had preceded it. The surprise of testing was [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] which was less powerful but more nimble than the Williams.\n\nThe first four rounds were won by [[Michael Schumacher]] in the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. Senna took pole in the first two races but failed to finish either of them. In the third race, the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix]] in Imola, Senna again took pole position, but was involved in [[death of Ayrton Senna|a fatal crash]] at the second corner after completing six laps.<ref>{{cite news|title=1994: Formula One's 'blackest day'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/witness/may/1/newsid_2951000/2951011.stm|work=BBC News |access-date=13 July 2006|date=1 May 1994}}</ref> The repercussions of Senna's fatal accident were severe for the team itself, as the Italian prosecutors tried to charge the team and [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] with manslaughter, an episode which was not over until 2005.<ref>{{cite news|title=Top designers acquitted on Senna|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4587195.stm|work=BBC News |date=27 May 2005|access-date=13 July 2007}}</ref> At the next race in [[1994 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], [[Damon Hill]] was the only Williams on the grid, as a mark of respect to Senna,<ref>[http://www.williamsf1.com/racing/about/our-history 'WilliamsF1.com > Seasons > 1994] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509134229/http://www.williamsf1.com/racing/about/our-history |date=9 May 2015 }}.

Hill took the team's first victory of the season, by almost half a minute over [[Michael Schumacher|Schumacher's]] [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], while Coulthard would retire due to an electrical problem. In [[1994 Canadian Grand Prix|Montreal]], both Williams cars finished in the points for the first time that season, with Hill finishing second and Coulthard finishing fifth. In France, Nigel Mansell replaced Coulthard (in the first of four appearances), at the behest of Renault. At Silverstone, Damon Hill accomplished what had eluded his father, twice Formula One World Champion [[Graham Hill]], by winning the [[1994 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]]. Hill closed the points gap with Schumacher, who was disqualified from first at [[1994 Belgian Grand Prix|Spa]] after the Stewards found floorboard irregularities on his Benetton. He was banned for the next two races, and Hill capitalised on this with wins in [[1994 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]] and a Williams 1\u20132 in [[1994 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]].\n\nWith three races left, 1992 champion [[Nigel Mansell]] returned from CART (where the season had concluded) to replace Coulthard for the remainder of the season. Mansell would get approximately \u00a3900,000 ''per race'', while Hill was paid \u00a3300,000 for the entire season, though Hill remained as lead driver.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Maurice|title=Frank Williams|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|page=244|isbn=0-333-71716-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/99/fra/preview/horton.html|title=Reflections on a Racing Rivalry|first=Roger|last=Horton|work=Atlas Autosport|publisher=Kaizar|access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nSchumacher came back after his suspension for the [[1994 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]], which he won by about 25 seconds, to take a lead of 5 points into the penultimate round in [[1994 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]. The race in Japan was held in torrential rain, with Hill managing to win the restarted race, by three seconds on aggregate over Schumacher who finished second. Going into the final round at [[1994 Australian Grand Prix|Adelaide]], Schumacher led Hill by a single point. Mansell took pole for Williams but had a poor start which let Hill and Schumacher through to fight for the lead and the 1994 title. Midway through the race, Schumacher's perceived need for a low downforce setup cost him, as he lost control and clipped the outside wall at the 5th corner (out of sight of Hill). As Schumacher recovered, Hill came around the corner and attempted to overtake into the next corner. Schumacher turned in and the resulting contact (Schumacher in the wall and Hill retiring with bent suspension), meant Schumacher was the champion. This collision has been controversial. Some, such as Williams's [[Patrick Head]], have suggested that this was a deliberate attempt by Schumacher to take Hill out of the race.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013164119/http://motoring.iafrica.com/formulaone/561093.htm 'Ruthless' Schumi blasted]. Retrieved 2 August 2006.</ref> Others, such as then BBC commentator Murray Walker, defended Schumacher, calling the accident a \"racing incident\". Meanwhile, Nigel Mansell won the last Grand Prix of his career here, driving the second Williams car.\n\nWilliams would end the season as Constructors' Champion for the third consecutive year, scoring 118 points, while Hill finished second in the Drivers' Championship with 91 points.\n\n====1995 season====\n[[File:Damon Hill 1995-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Damon Hill]] in the FW17 at [[1995 Canadian Grand Prix|Montreal]] in 1995 when he qualified second but retired after 50 race laps due to a gearbox problem]]\n\nIn {{F1|1995}}, [[Nigel Mansell]] was not retained, Williams favouring [[David Coulthard|Coulthard]] over him to partner [[Damon Hill|Hill]]. [[Michael Schumacher|Schumacher]], whose Benetton team had switched engine suppliers from Ford to Renault in the off-season, won the first round in [[1995 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], with Coulthard taking second. However, both were disqualified from the race after it was found that [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf]] supplied their teams with a type of fuel for which samples had not been provided to the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]. Thus, [[Gerhard Berger]] and Ferrari were declared winners. Schumacher and Coulthard had their positions reinstated after appeal, though Benetton and Williams were not awarded their Constructors' points. Hill won the next two races in [[1995 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]] and [[1995 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]] and would later win races at [[1995 Hungarian Grand Prix|The Hungaroring]] and in [[1995 Australian Grand Prix|Adelaide]]. Hill won two laps ahead of the field at Adelaide in one of F1's most dominating victories. Coulthard recorded his only 1995 win for the Williams team at [[1995 Portuguese Grand Prix|Estoril]], before moving to McLaren.\n\nWilliams's champion streak was ended by [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], who elected to switch engine suppliers from Ford to Renault, the same as Williams. As such, Benetton outscored Williams by 29 points in the Constructors' Championship. Damon Hill placed second in the Drivers' Championship, 33 points behind Benetton's Michael Schumacher.\n\n====1996 season====\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1996.jpg|thumb|Jacques Villeneuve in the FW18 at the [[1996 Canadian Grand Prix]]]]\nFor {{F1|1996}}, Williams had the quickest and most reliable car, the [[Williams FW18|FW18]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00244.html|title=Review of the year 1996|first=Joe|last=Saward|date=2 December 1996|access-date=1 October 2010|publisher=GrandPrix.com|archive-date=9 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409175501/http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00244.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Coulthard had left Williams to join [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] at McLaren, and Williams replaced him with Canadian [[Jacques Villeneuve]], who had won the [[Champ Car|CART]] series title in 1995, while [[Damon Hill|Hill]] remained with the team. [[Michael Schumacher|Schumacher]] left [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] to join [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Williams won the first five Grands Prix, Hill winning all but one of them. [[Olivier Panis]] would take victory at the sixth round in [[1996 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] after both Williams cars retired. Hill would retire for the second time in a row after he spun-off in [[1996 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]], while his teammate, Villeneuve, took third place. Hill and Villeneuve dominated the next Grand Prix in [[1996 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], with a 1\u20132 in qualifying and a 1\u20132 finish. Williams made it a second 1\u20132 after Hill won the [[1996 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]]. Villeneuve won his second race in F1 at [[1996 British Grand Prix|Silverstone]] after Hill retired with a wheel bearing failure on lap 26. Hill was victorious in the next Grand Prix in [[1996 German Grand Prix|Germany]] while Villeneuve won the race after that in [[1996 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]]. Schumacher's Ferrari would then take the next two Grands Prix at [[1996 Belgian Grand Prix|Spa-Francorchamps]] and [[1996 Italian Grand Prix|Monza]]. Villeneuve mounted a title challenge going into the final race of the season at [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], but Hill reasserted his dominance to take the race and the 1996 title, while Villeneuve lost a wheel and retired.\n\nWilliams's dominance was such that they had clinched the Constructors' Championship and only their drivers had a mathematical chance of taking the title, several races before the season concluded. Around that time, [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] announced that Hill would not be re-signed after his contract expired, despite Hill's successes and eventual Drivers' Championship, so he joined [[Arrows (F1)|Arrows]] for 1997. [[Adrian Newey]] had ambitions as a technical director (rather than just chief designer), but this was not possible at Williams, as [[Patrick Head]] was a founder and shareholder of the team. McLaren lured Newey away, though he was forced to take [[garden leave]] for the majority of 1997.\n\n====1997 season====\nFor what would be the final season of Williams-Renault and a car designed with Newey's input, [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] brought in German [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]], who had created a good impression on Williams during his first few seasons in Formula One. Frentzen proved to be a disappointment though, and won only one race in two years with Williams, the [[1997 San Marino Grand Prix]]. [[Jacques Villeneuve]] won seven races during 1997, compared to five wins by his main rival, [[Michael Schumacher]] of a resurgent Ferrari. Williams also achieved the 100-race-win milestone at the [[1997 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]]. Coming to the final round of the season at [[1997 European Grand Prix|Jerez]], Schumacher led Villeneuve by 1 point; however, on lap 48, Schumacher and Villeneuve collided. Schumacher was disqualified from second place in the championship as the accident was deemed by the FIA as \"avoidable\". Williams won the Constructors' title for the second time in a row, scoring 123 points. Jacques Villeneuve won the Drivers' Championship by three points to Michael Schumacher, who kept his points total despite being removed from second place; thus, runner-up went to Frentzen with 42 points.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saward|first=Joe|title=Review of the year 1997|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00278.html|publisher=GrandPrix.com|date=1 November 1997|access-date=9 June 2012|archive-date=30 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130200853/http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00278.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Mecachrome engines (1998)===\n====1998 season====\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1998 Italy.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques Villeneuve]] in the FW20 at the [[1998 Italian Grand Prix]]]]\n\nAfter 1997, the team was unable to maintain their dominance in Formula 1 as Renault ended their full-time involvement in Formula 1, and [[Adrian Newey]] moved to the rival team, McLaren. Williams then had to pay for [[Mecachrome]] engines, which were old, rebadged [[Renault F1]] engines.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saward|first=Joe|title=Mecachrome|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00283.html|publisher=GrandPrix.com|date=1 January 1998|access-date=14 July 2006|archive-date=30 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130201521/http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00283.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> This meant that the FW20 not only featured a very similar aerodynamic package to their 1997 car but also virtually the same engine, leading some to comment that they ran what was virtually the same car, adjusted for the 1998 regulations. There were changes on the sponsorship front, as Rothmans opted to promote their [[Winfield (cigarette)|Winfield]] brand, replacing the popular blue and white livery with a red one.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saward|first=Joe|title=Williams FW20|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00284.html|publisher=GrandPrix.com|date=28 January 1998|access-date=14 July 2006|archive-date=30 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130210516/http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00284.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> For {{F1|1998}}, Williams kept both drivers from the previous season, the first time since {{F1|1983}} that a reigning world champion remained driving for the team. While Ferrari and McLaren battled for the Constructors' and Drivers' titles, Williams fell to the middle of the field. The team won no races and took only 3 podiums during the season, with Frentzen finishing in third at the first round in [[1998 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]] and Villeneuve finishing third in [[1998 German Grand Prix|Germany]] and [[1998 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]]. Williams finished third in the Constructors' Championship, scoring 38 points, while Villeneuve finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship with 21 points, and his German teammate, Frentzen, finished 4 points behind him in seventh.\n\n===Supertec engines (1999)===\n====1999 season====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2020}}\n[[File:Alex Zanardi 1999 Canada.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alex Zanardi|Alessandro Zanardi]] in the FW21 at the [[1999 Canadian Grand Prix]]]]\n\nIn {{F1|1999}}, Williams employed the [[Supertec]] engine, which was a rebadged Mecachrome-Renault unit, and a new driver line-up. [[Jacques Villeneuve|Villeneuve]] moved to the new [[British American Racing]] (BAR) team, while [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen|Frentzen]] moved to [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] trading places with fellow German [[Ralf Schumacher]] who joined Williams.  To replace Villeneuve, Williams signed Italian [[Alex Zanardi]], who after an unsuccessful F1 career in the early 1990s had been racing in the CART series, winning two series championships and a total of fifteen races in his three years. As with Schumacher a driver trade was made, where Zanardi would join Williams and the team's test driver at the time, [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], would join CART in Zanardi's car for [[Chip Ganassi Racing]].\n\nThe team managed three podiums, all scored by Ralf Schumacher, with third place in [[1999 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]] and [[1999 British Grand Prix|Britain]] and a second place in [[1999 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]]. Zanardi, meanwhile, struggled through the entire season and failed to finish in the points at any race. Due in large part to this, the team finished fifth in the Constructors' Championship, the lowest finish for Williams in the 1990s; the team finished behind [[Stewart Grand Prix|Stewart]] and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]], with Schumacher scoring all of the team's 35 points.\n\nAfter the season, deciding the relationship was not working, Zanardi's contract with the team was terminated by mutual agreement. He would eventually return to CART in 2001.\n\n===BMW engines (2000\u20132005)===\n{{main|BMW in Formula One}}\n[[File:BMW Williams logo.png|thumb|Team logo during partnership with [[BMW]]]]\nIn 1998, the team signed a long-term agreement with German manufacturer [[BMW]] to supply engines and expertise for a period of 6 years. As part of the deal, BMW expected at least one driver to be German, which led to the team's signing of Ralf Schumacher for the subsequent season. In 1999, the team had a Williams car with a BMW engine testing at circuits, in preparation for a debut in the {{F1|2000}} season.\n\nThere were major sponsorship changes for 2000\u20132005, as Rothmans International had been purchased in 1999 by [[British American Tobacco]] (BAT), which owned [[British American Racing]] and chose not to renew Rothmans' contract with Williams. BMW paid for Williams cars to be entirely in blue and white \u2013 unlike the standard motorsport livery scheme, dominated by the colours of the team or major sponsors with the logos of minor sponsors in their own colour schemes. Williams' second major sponsor became [[Compaq]], and following Compaq's acquisition the team debuted [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) sponsorship at the [[2002 British Grand Prix]].

The first season of Williams' partnership with BMW did not yield a single victory, but they managed to get on the podium three times, with [[Ralf Schumacher]] responsible for all three. Williams finished third in the Constructors' Championship, with 36 points, one more than the prior year. [[Ralf Schumacher]] finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship, while Button, in his debut season, finished in eighth. Button made scrappy mistakes in early races (Monaco, Europe), but overall made an impressive debut in Melbourne, and continued to impress, notably at Silverstone, Spa, and Suzuka.\n\n====2001 season====\n[[File:Ralf Schumacher 2001 Canada.jpg|thumb|left|Williams returned to the winner's rostrum in {{F1|2001}} with four Grands Prix victories including one for [[Ralf Schumacher]] in [[2001 Canadian Grand Prix|Montreal]]]]\nIn {{F1|2001}}, the arrangement between Williams and Ganassi came to an end, and thus Williams was able to bring [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] back to drive full-time for the team. He was returning after two successful years in CART, where he succeeded Zanardi as champion for 1999 and won ten races total; he also had become the first CART driver since the infamous 1996 split of American open-wheel racing to win the Indianapolis 500, doing so in 2000.\n\nSince Montoya was returning to Williams, this left Jenson Button as the odd man out. He would move over to [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], which was still running rebadged Renault engines, for what was the team's final season under that name.\n\nThe [[Williams FW23|FW23]] won four races, three by [[Ralf Schumacher]] at [[2001 San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]], [[2001 Canadian Grand Prix|Montreal]], and his home Grand Prix in [[2001 German Grand Prix|Germany]]. His teammate, Montoya, was victorious at [[2001 Italian Grand Prix|Monza]], and would have won a few more races if not for the FW23's unreliability and pit crew blunders. The car proved to be quicker than the Ferrari and McLaren counterparts in several races, but Williams's 2001 campaign only yielded third place in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n====2002 season====\nWilliams maintained their driver line-up for the {{F1|2002}} season. The team only won one race, which was at [[2002 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]], one of only 2 races not won by Ferrari in a year dominated by the [[Ferrari F2002|Ferraris]] of [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Rubens Barrichello]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Andrew|title=Schumacher paints F1 red|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2282980.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=13 October 2002|access-date=13 July 2008}}</ref>  Despite Montoya qualifying on pole for 7 races, he ended up having a winless season. Williams did improve on their Constructors' Championship position, finishing in second.

Montoya stayed in contention for the Drivers' Championship during the season, and finished third, 11 points behind [[Michael Schumacher]], while Ralf Schumacher finished fifth, 24 points behind Montoya. Williams finished second in the Constructors' Championship, two points ahead of McLaren.\n\n====2004 season====\n[[File:J p montoya usgp 2004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Juan Pablo Montoya]] in the \"Walrus-Nose\" designed [[Williams FW26]] during the [[2004 United States Grand Prix]] when he qualified fifth for the race but was disqualified for illegally using the spare car]]\nAt the start of the {{F1|2004}} season, it was announced that Montoya would be moving to McLaren in 2005. The team began the season with a radical nose-cone design, known as the \"[[Walrus]]-Nose\", that proved uncompetitive and was replaced by a more conventional assembly in [[2004 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]]. [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] dominated for a third consecutive season, winning 15 of the 18 races. Williams picked up a win at the final race in [[2004 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], with [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] finishing one second ahead of [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]]'s McLaren; this remained Williams's last F1 win until the [[2012 Spanish Grand Prix]].

The Williams team also switched to [[Bridgestone]] tyres.\n\nThe season started well, with both drivers scoring points in the opening race of the season, and Nico Rosberg setting the fastest lap at the [[2006 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain Grand Prix]]. The rest of the season was disappointing for Williams, with 20 retirements out of 36 starts for the two cars.

While Rosberg managed to obtain 2 podiums in [[2008 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]] and [[2008 Singapore Grand Prix|Singapore]], the team struggled at circuits with high-speed corners. The fact that the team was one of the first to switch development to their 2009 car (when new regulations came in) also hindered their season and Williams finished a disappointing 8th in the Constructors' Championship. Rosberg stated that unless the team was more competitive in the near future, he would look to drive elsewhere. Williams retained Rosberg and Nakajima for the 2009 season.\n\nFrank Williams had admitted that he had regretted parting with BMW but stated that Toyota had a tremendous ability to become a top engine supplier.

The [[rally car]] was a [[Austin Metro|MG Metro]] with a completely new [[V6 engine]] ([[mid-engined]]) and [[four-wheel drive]], developed to the international [[Group B]] rallying regulations. Williams developed the car in just six months.\n\n===British Touring Car Championship (1995\u20131999)===\nWilliams entered the [[British Touring Car Championship]] in [[1995 British Touring Car Championship season|1995]], taking over the works Renault programme. [[Alain Menu]] transferred from Renault Dealer Racing, with [[Will Hoy]] signed to partner him. Williams employed Ian Harrison, future director of [[Triple Eight Racing]] as team manager. While Menu was a championship contender, Hoy had constant failures and bad luck during the first half of the season. However, Hoy's luck changed and he won three races and scored several podium finishes in the second half of the year, eventually taking fourth in the championship while Menu finished second in the championship with seven wins. Renault won the manufacturers championship. [[1996 British Touring Car Championship season|1996]] was a more difficult year with the front-wheel-drive cars outclassed by the 4WD [[Audi A4]]s of [[Frank Biela]] and [[John Bintcliffe]]. Menu was second in the championship again, while Hoy finished a lowly ninth. [[1997 British Touring Car Championship season|1997]] was a breakthrough year for Williams, winning the drivers' championship with Menu, the manufacturers' trophy and teams' award. Other changes for the team saw [[Jason Plato]] replacing Hoy, taking third in the championship. The team won 15 races out of 24 in 1997. It also competed in the [[1997 AMP Bathurst 1000|1997 Bathurst 1000]] with Menu and Plato leading for much of the early part of the race. [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] drove the second car, his first appearance for Williams since 1981.\n\n[[1998 British Touring Car Championship season|1998]] saw few changes to the Williams team: the driver line-up was unchanged with Menu to defend his title alongside Plato, but the main sponsor for 1998 was [[Nescaf\u00e9]], with Renault still putting sponsorship in for the team. While the Renaults had a new look for 1998, the opposition had caught up after 1997, and both Menu and Plato had a more difficult season, finishing fourth and fifth in the championship. In the final round of 1998 at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]], a third car was entered for Independents Champion [[Tommy Rustad]]. Renault ultimately finished third in the manufacturers trophy and second in the teams championship. [[1999 British Touring Car Championship season|1999]] was the most difficult season for Williams, as Menu left Renault after racing with them since 1993. Plato was joined by [[Jean-Christophe Boullion]]. Nescaf\u00e9 were again the main sponsor for the Williams team in 1999. Renault did not have much luck in 1999 with engine failures haunting the team during the mid-part of the season. One win for Plato was the only success for the season, and Renault pulled out of the BTCC at the end of the season.\n\n===Le Mans 24 Hours and Sportscars (1998\u20132000)===\n{{Main|24 Hours of Le Mans}}\nPrior to their F1 partnership, Williams Motorsport built [[Le Mans Prototype]]s for [[BMW]], known as the [[BMW V12 LM|V12 LM]] and [[BMW V12 LMR|V12 LMR]].

Williams Advanced Engineering will supply the batteries for the first two seasons of Extreme E, which began in 2021.\n\nOn 2 May 2019, it was announced that Williams Advanced Engineering will supply the batteries for the multi-make [[ETCR]] series that is due to launch in 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.autosport.com/wtcr/news/143121/williams-to-supply-e-tcr-series-with-batteries|title=Williams Advanced Engineering to supply E TCR series with batteries|author=Jack Cozens|date=2 May 2019|website=Autosport.com}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 January 2022, the Australian mining firm [[Fortescue Metals Group]] announced it would be purchasing Williams Advanced Engineering for \u00a3164m in an effort to meet its carbon neutral targets for 2030.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60106871|title=Fortescue: Firm owned by Australia's richest man buys Williams F1 battery arm|date=24 January 2022|website=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nWAE generated revenues of \u00a310.9m in fiscal year 2014\u201315, with profits of \u00a31m.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-34149398|title=Williams cuts losses as revenues accelerate|date=4 September 2015|work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>\n\n===Williams Hybrid Power===\nWilliams Hybrid Power (WHP) was the division of Williams F1 that developed electromechanical [[flywheel]]s for mobile applications such as buses, trams and high-performance endurance-racing cars. A hybrid system that uses a spinning composite rotor to store energy, these flywheels help a vehicle save fuel and ultimately reduce its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.\n\nWHP was first established in 2008 and immediately set about developing a new flywheel energy-recovery system for the Williams F1 Team after the introduction of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) into Formula One for the 2009 season. While other teams were pouring their efforts into electric battery systems, Williams F1 opted to go down the flywheel route because of a strong belief in the technology's wider applications. While it was never raced in Formula One due to technical changes, WHP has since seen its technology adapted for a range of applications. For example, the Audi R18 hybrid car that won the 2012 Le Mans 24 Hours used a WHP flywheel. WHP has also seen its flywheel technology introduced into a series of buses as part of a deal with the Go-Ahead Group, one of the UK's biggest transport operators. In April 2014, Williams Hybrid Power was sold to [[GKN]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://williamsf1.com/Investors/Investors-News/GKN-Acquires-Williams-Hybrid-Power/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410045310/http://williamsf1.com/Investors/Investors-News/GKN-Acquires-Williams-Hybrid-Power/ |archive-date=10 April 2014 |title=GKN Acquires Williams Hybrid Power |publisher=Williams F1 |date=1 April 2014 |access-date=2 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Formula One results==\n{{Main|Williams Grand Prix results}}\n* Constructors' Championships winning percentage: {{Percentage|9|45|1}}<!-- 9/45 [1978\u20132022] -->\n* Drivers' Championships winning percentage: {{Percentage|7|45|1}}<!-- 7/45 [1978\u20132022] -->\n* Winning percentage: {{Percentage|{{f1cstat|WIL|wins}}|{{f1cstat|WIL|entries}}|1}}<!-- auto updated -->\n<div style=\"overflow-x: auto; margin: 1em 0\">\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"9\"| Formula One results\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\"| (''italics'' indicates non-works entries; '''bold''' indicates championships won)\n|-\n!
