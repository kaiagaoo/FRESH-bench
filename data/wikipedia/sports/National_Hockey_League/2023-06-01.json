The penalty shot was adopted from the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] to ensure players were not being blocked from opportunities to score. For the 2005\u201306 season, the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside. First, the league removed the \"offside pass\" or \"two-line pass\" rule, which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team's [[Ice hockey rink#Zones|defending zone]] was completed on the offensive side of the centre line, unless the puck crossed the line before the player.<ref name=\"newoffside\">{{Cite news|title=Relaunching the Game |author=CBC Sports |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |date=July 22, 2005 |access-date=June 10, 2006 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516050646/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html |archive-date=May 16, 2006 }}</ref> Furthermore, the league reinstated the \"tag-up offside\" which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone.<ref name=\"newoffside\" /> The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring,<ref name=\"newoffside\" /> which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid-nineties and the increased prevalence of the [[neutral zone trap]]. Since 2005, when a team is guilty of [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing the puck]] they are not allowed to make a line change or skater substitution of any sort before the following [[face-off]] (except to replace an injured player or re-install a [[extra attacker|pulled goaltender]]).<ref name=\"icing\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule81.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514155000/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule81.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 14, 2013 |title=Icing |website=National Hockey League |access-date=March 1, 2013 |year=2005 }}</ref> Since 2013, the league has used ''hybrid icing'', where a [[Official (ice hockey)#Linesman|linesman]] stops play due to icing if a defending player (other than the goaltender) crosses the imaginary line that connects the two face-off dots in their defensive zone before an attacking player is able to. This was done to counter a trend of player injury in races to the puck.<ref name=\"icing\" />\n\nIn the NHL, [[Fighting in ice hockey|fighting]] leads to ''major penalties'' while IIHF rules, and most amateur rules, call for the ejection of fighting players.<ref name=\"major\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule27.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423154838/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule27.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 23, 2006 |title=Major penalties |website=National Hockey League |access-date=June 8, 2006 |year=2005 }}</ref><ref name=\"fighting_iihf\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/sports/icehockey/essentials/intlvsnhl.shtml |title=Ice Hockey Essentials \u2013 International vs. NHL |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=June 26, 2006 |year=2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060221192349/http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/sports/icehockey/essentials/intlvsnhl.shtml |archive-date = February 21, 2006}}</ref> Usually, a penalized team cannot replace a player that is penalized on the ice and is thus [[short-handed]] for the duration of the penalty,<ref name=\"minor\" /> but if the penalties are coincidental, for example when two players fight, both teams remain at full strength.

Players are banned from [[gambling]] and criminal activities have led to the suspension of players. The league and the Players' Association agreed to a stringent anti-doping policy in the 2005 collective bargaining agreement. The policy provides for a twenty-game suspension for a first positive test, a sixty-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&no_ads= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023064426/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&no_ads= |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 23, 2005 |title=NHL unveils new drug testing policy |date=September 28, 2005 |access-date=January 2, 2007 |first=Scott |last=Laurie |publisher=CTV }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of regulation time, the team with the most goals wins the game. If a game is tied after regulation time, [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] ensues.

If the game is still tied at the end of overtime, the game enters a [[Overtime (ice hockey)#North American shootouts|shootout]]. Three players for each team in turn take a [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]. The team with the most goals during the three-round shootout wins the game.

Full training camps begin in mid-to-late September, including a preseason consisting of six to eight [[exhibition game]]s. Split squad games, in which parts of a team's regular season roster play separate games on the same day, are occasionally played during the preseason.\n\nDuring the regular season, clubs play each other in a predefined schedule. Since 2021, in the regular season, all teams play 82 games: 41 games each of home and road, playing 26 games in their own geographic division\u2014four against five of their seven other divisional opponents, plus three against two others; 24 games against the eight remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents\u2014three games against every team in the other division of its conference; and 32 against every team in the other conference twice\u2014home and road.<ref>{{Cite news|title=NHL ramps up rivalries |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/the-explainer-new-nhl-playoff-seeding-format-1.1871216 |author=CBC Sports Online |publisher=CBC.ca |date=July 27, 2005 |access-date=June 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927195147/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/the-explainer-new-nhl-playoff-seeding-format-1.1871216/ |archive-date=September 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe league's regular season standings are based on a point system. Two points are awarded for a win, one point for losing in overtime or a shootout, and zero points for a loss in regulation. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion, and the league's overall leader is awarded the [[Presidents' Trophy]].\n\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs, which go from April to the beginning of June, are an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion. Eight teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs: the top three teams in each division plus the two conference teams with the next highest number of points.<ref name=\"nhl_playoff_format\">{{cite web|website=National Hockey League |title=Playoff formats |year=2005 |access-date=June 6, 2006 |url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/formats.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010718071657/http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/formats.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2001 }}</ref> The two conference champions proceed to the Stanley Cup Finals.

Early NHL drafts took place at the Queen Elizabeth (currently Fairmont) Hotel in Montreal. Amateur players from junior, collegiate, or European leagues are eligible to enter the Entry Draft. The selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season, playoff results, and a draft lottery. The 16 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round, with the last place team having the best chance of winning the lottery. Once the lottery determines the initial draft picks, the order for the remaining non-playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season. For those teams that did qualify for the playoffs, the draft order is then determined by total regular season points for non-division winners that are eliminated in the first two rounds of the playoffs, then any division winners that failed to reach the Conference Finals. Conference finalists receive the 29th and 30th picks depending on total points, with the Stanley Cup runner-up given the 31st pick and the Stanley Cup champions the final pick.\n\n==Trophies and awards==\n{{Main|List of National Hockey League awards}}\n\n===Teams===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-left:1em; float:right\"\n|+ '''Stanley Cup championships'''<br /><small>[[List of defunct NHL teams|Defunct teams]] not included.</small>\n!

The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the [[Presidents' Trophy]].\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens are the most successful franchise in the league. Since the formation of the league in 1917, they have 25 NHL championships (three between 1917 and 1925 when the Stanley Cup was still contested in an interleague competition, twenty-two since 1926 after the Stanley Cup became the NHL's championship trophy). They also lead all teams with 24 [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup championships]] (one as an NHA team, twenty-three as an NHL team). Of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, the Montreal Canadiens are surpassed in the number of championships only by the [[New York Yankees]] of [[Major League Baseball]], who have three more.\n\nThe longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five, held by the Montreal Canadiens from 1955\u201356 to 1959\u201360.<ref name=\"list_stanley_cup\">{{cite web |title=Stanley Cup Winners |url=http://proicehockey.about.com/od/stanleycupbunker/a/stanley_cuplist.htm |first=Jamie |last=Fitzpatrick |publisher=about.com |access-date=June 26, 2006 |year=2006 |archive-date=April 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424154149/http://proicehockey.about.com/od/stanleycupbunker/a/stanley_cuplist.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> The 1977 edition of the Montreal Canadiens, the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions, was named by ESPN as the second greatest sports team of all time.<ref name=\"greatest team\">{{cite web|title=The 10 greatest teams |url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/greatteams.html |publisher=ESPN |date=December 31, 1999 |access-date=June 26, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe next most successful NHL franchise is the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 Stanley Cup championships, most recently in 1967. The Detroit Red Wings, with 11 Stanley Cup championships, are the most successful American franchise.\n\nThe same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards. The Stanley Cup, much like its Canadian Football League [[Grey Cup|counterpart]], is unique in this aspect, as opposed to the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], [[Larry O'Brien Trophy]], and [[World Series Trophy|Commissioner's Trophy]], which have new ones made every year for that year's champion. Despite only one trophy being used, the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup. The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year.\n\n===Players===\nThere are numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season; they include, among others, the [[Art Ross Trophy]] for the league scoring champion (goals and assists), the [[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy]] for the goal-scoring leader, and the [[William M.

The most prestigious individual award is the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] which is awarded annually to the [[Most Valuable Player]]; the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season. The [[Vezina Trophy]] is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goaltender as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL. The [[James Norris Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the National Hockey League's top defenceman, the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the top rookie, and the [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy]] is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship; all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association.\n\nIn addition to the regular season awards, the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs. Furthermore, the top coach in the league wins the [[Jack Adams Award]] as selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association. The National Hockey League publishes the names of the top three vote getters for all awards, and then names the award winner during the NHL Awards Ceremony.<ref name=\"awards\" />\n\nPlayers, coaches, officials, and team builders who have had notable careers are eligible to be voted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].

The league's American broadcast partners had been in flux for decades prior to 1995. Hockey broadcasting on a national scale was particularly spotty prior to 1981; [[NHL on NBC|NBC]], [[NHL on CBS|CBS]], and [[NHL on ABC|ABC]] held rights at various times during that period but with limited schedules during the second half of the regular season and the playoffs, along with some (but not all) of the [[Stanley Cup Finals]]. The NHL primarily was then only available on [[Cable television in the United States|cable television]] after 1981, airing on the [[NHL on USA|USA Network]], [[NHL on SportsChannel America|SportsChannel America]], and [[ESPN National Hockey Night|ESPN]] at various times. Since 1995, national coverage has been split between broadcast and cable, first with [[NHL on Fox|Fox]] and ESPN from 1995 to 1999, then followed by ABC and ESPN from 1999 to 2004. The U.S. national rights were then held by NBC and [[NHL on Versus|OLN]] (later renamed [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]], then [[NBCSN]]) between the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout]] and 2021.\n\nThe [[2021\u201322 NHL season|2021\u201322 season]] marks the first year of seven-year agreements with [[NHL on ESPN|ESPN]] and [[NHL on Turner Sports|Turner Sports]].<ref name=\"CNBC2021\">{{cite news|title=NHL moving to Turner Sports is $1 billion risk-reward for hockey |work=CNBC|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/turner-sports-nhl-announce-seven-year-deal-for-broadcast-rights.html|date=April 27, 2021|accessdate=April 27, 2021}}</ref> ESPN's deal includes 25 regular season games on ABC or ESPN, and 75 exclusive games streamed on [[ESPN+]] and [[Hulu]].<ref name=\"ESPN announcement\">{{cite news|title=NHL back on ESPN with 7-year multiplatform deal|work=ESPN|url=https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/31039351/nhl-back-espn-7-year-multiplatform-deal|date=March 10, 2021|accessdate=April 13, 2021}}</ref> Turner Sports' coverage includes up to 72 regular season games on TNT or TBS.<ref name=\"Turner announcement\">{{cite news|title=Turner Sports inks 7-year deal with NHL, will air 3 Stanley Cup finals|work=ESPN|url=https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/31346196/turner-sports-inks-seven-year-deal-nhl-air-3-stanley-cup-finals|date=April 27, 2021|accessdate=April 27, 2021}}</ref> The playoffs will be split between ESPN and Turner, with ABC televising the Stanley Cup Finals during even years and TNT televising the championship series during odd years.<ref name=\"CNBC2021\"/>\n\nAs in Canada, games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team's home market and are subject to [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] outside of them.

The 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs saw the largest audience in the sport's history \"after a regular season that saw record-breaking business success, propelled largely by the NHL's strategy of engaging fans through big events and robust digital offerings.\"<ref>\"[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=531630 Stanley Cup Playoffs attract largest audience ever]\", \"NHL.com\", June 14, 2010</ref> This success has resulted in a 66 percent rise in NHL advertising and sponsorship revenue. Merchandise sales were up 22 percent, and the number of unique visitors on the NHL.com website was up 17 percent during the playoffs after rising 29 percent in the regular season.<ref>Klayman, Ben. \"[http://ca.news.finance.yahoo.com/s/14062010/6/finance-interview-nhl-ad-sponsorship-revenue-66-pct-year.html NHL ad, sponsorship revenue up 66 pct this year]\", \"Yahoo!
