On January 7, 2010, the Red Bulls confirmed the hiring of veteran Swedish manager [[Hans Backe]] as head coach. Not long after Backe was confirmed as coach, he started to release many players signed by Osorio including [[Jorge Rojas (Venezuelan footballer)|Jorge Rojas]], [[Danny Cepero]], [[Carlos Johnson (footballer)|Carlos Johnson]], and [[Walter Garc\u00eda]], while midfielder [[Matthew Mbuta]]'s contract was not picked up for the 2010 season. Under the direction of Backe and newly hired Norwegian sporting director [[Erik Sol\u00e9r]], the club began a new approach of signing veteran European players (mainly from [[Scandinavia]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]]) instead of the South American and Central American players that are usually sought after in MLS. With Backe as head coach, the Red Bulls went undefeated in the 2010 preseason, including the first ever match at [[Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)|Red Bull Arena]] against [[Santos FC|Santos]] of Brazil, which the Red Bulls won 3\u20131. In this preseason game, newly signed Estonian international midfielder [[Joel Lindpere]] became the first player to score a goal in Red Bull Arena. The Red Bulls carried this form into the first MLS match at Red Bull Arena against the Chicago Fire by winning 1\u20130 with the lone goal coming from Joel Lindpere. A week later, the Red Bulls defeated the [[Seattle Sounders FC|Seattle Sounders]] 1\u20130 at [[Qwest Field]] in Seattle, breaking a 27-game road winless streak.\n\nThe club signed legendary French forward [[Thierry Henry]] as a [[Designated Player Rule|designated player]] in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.eurosport.com/football/international-football/2009/new-york-confirm-henry_sto2397933/story.shtml|title=Henry goes to New York|date=July 14, 2010|publisher=Eurosport}}</ref> A month later on August 2, the Red Bulls signed their third designated player, Mexican international defender [[Rafael M\u00e1rquez]].

With these new additions, the Red Bulls improved further and clinched first place in the Eastern Conference for the first time since 2000. New York also set an MLS record for best one-season improvement, finishing with 51 points after having just 21 points the previous year. Despite the impressive turnaround, the season again ended in disappointment for the Red Bulls. The Eastern Conference semi-finals saw the Red Bulls fall to the San Jose Earthquakes.
