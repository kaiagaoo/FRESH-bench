At the turn of the 20th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, and the rest of the ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity [[all-seater stadium]]. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and Sir John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,354. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James' with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James' Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James' Park currently seats 52,354 people, but former club owner [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] had said he would consider taking the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats, taking the total capacity to 58,420, but only if the team managed to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.<ref name=formation /><ref name=st_james>{{cite web|title=The Sports Direct Arena Story |publisher=Newcastle United F.C. |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |access-date=13 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113184643/http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |archive-date=13 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, Ashley announced that he planned to lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium.<ref name=off_market /><ref name=direct>{{cite news\n |url          = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8342406.stm\n |title        = Newcastle reveal new stadium name\n |website = BBC Sport\n |date         = 4 November 2009\n|access-date   = 4 November 2009\n|location     = London\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091105044920/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8342406.stm\n |archive-date = 5 November 2009\n|url-status   = live\n}}</ref> This name was only supposed to be used until the end of the [[2009\u201310 Newcastle United F.C. season|2009\u201310 season]], but lasted until November 2011.<ref name=direct /><ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Newcastle-owner-Mike-Ashley-has-spent-a-staggering-285-8million-on-the-club-so-far-it-can-be-revealed-today-article718115.html\n |title        = Newcastle 'have cost Ashley \u00a3285.8m so far'\n |first        = Simon\n |last         = Bird\n |date         = 29 March 2011\n|newspaper = Daily Mirror\n |location     = London\n |access-date   = 13 April 2011\n|archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110402150324/http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Newcastle-owner-Mike-Ashley-has-spent-a-staggering-285-8million-on-the-club-so-far-it-can-be-revealed-today-article718115.html\n |archive-date = 2 April 2011\n|url-status   = dead\n}}</ref> On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this was an interim name to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium.
