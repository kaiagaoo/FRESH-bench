The club competes in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of [[English football league system|English football]]. Since the formation of the club in 1892, when [[Newcastle East End F.C.|Newcastle East End]] absorbed the assets of [[Newcastle West End F.C.|Newcastle West End]] to become Newcastle United, the club has played its home matches at [[St James' Park]]. Located in the centre of Newcastle, it currently has a capacity of 52,305.\n\nThe club has been a member of the Premier League for all but three years of the competition's history, spending 91 seasons in the top flight as of May 2023, and has never dropped below English football's second tier since joining the [[Football League]] in 1893. Newcastle have won four [[List of English football champions|League titles]], six [[FA Cup]]s and an [[FA Charity Shield]], as well as the [[1968\u201369 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], the [[List of football clubs in England by competitive honours won|ninth-highest total of trophies won by an English club]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2015/03/02/englands-ten-most-successful-clubs-chelsea-still-way-behind-arsenal-liverpool-man-united-despite-capital-one-cup-win/ |title=England's Ten Most Successful Clubs: Chelsea Still Way Behind Arsenal, Liverpool & Man United Despite Capital One Cup Win |first=Mark |last=Brus |date=2 March 2015|access-date=5 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813180858/http://www.caughtoffside.com/2015/03/02/englands-ten-most-successful-clubs-chelsea-still-way-behind-arsenal-liverpool-man-united-despite-capital-one-cup-win/|archive-date=13 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The club's most successful period was between 1904 and 1910, when they won an FA Cup and three of their League titles.

In October 2021, a consortium led by the [[Public Investment Fund]], the [[sovereign wealth fund]] of [[Saudi Arabia]], became majority owners of Newcastle United.\n\nThe team's traditional kit colours are black-and-white striped shirts, black shorts and black or white socks. Their crest has elements of the city [[coat of arms]], which features two grey [[Hippocampus (mythology)|hippocamps]].

Later that year, Newcastle's first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of [[Byker]] in November 1881. This team was renamed [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in [[Stanley, County Durham]]. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, [[Newcastle West End F.C.]] formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886 moved into [[St James' Park]].<ref name=formation>{{cite web |last=Joannou |first=P. |title=The Formation of Newcastle United |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/ClubHistory/0,,10278~2108980,00.html |publisher=Newcastle United F.C. |access-date=3 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320211146/http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/ClubHistory/0%2C%2C10278~2108980%2C00.html |archive-date=20 March 2011}}</ref> The two clubs became rivals in the [[Northern Football League|Northern League]].

Newcastle West End was eventually dissolved, and a number of its players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East End, effectively merging the two clubs, with Newcastle East End taking over the lease on St James' Park in May 1892.<ref name=formation />\n\nWith only one senior club in the city for fans to support, development of the club was much more rapid.
