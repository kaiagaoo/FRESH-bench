In the early 1900s, sportswriter [[Charles Dryden]] nicknamed the team the Trolley Dodgers after the Brooklyn pedestrians who dodged streetcars in the city, and the Dodgers nickname was used contemporaneously with Superbas and Robins. In 1932, the team allowed the Brooklyn baseball writers to select a permanent name, and the writers chose Dodgers on January 22, 1932. The only other nickname seriously considered by the writers was Kings.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Holmes |first=Thomas |date=January 23, 1932 |title=Brooklyn Baseball Club Will Officially Nickname Them 'Dodgers' |pages=14 |work=[[The Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Chris|title=Strange-but-true origin stories of 19 sports team names|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/02/how-nfl-teams-got-nickname-mlb-nba-nhl-origin|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 9, 2015|access-date=October 25, 2015|archive-date=November 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105013228/http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/02/how-nfl-teams-got-nickname-mlb-nba-nhl-origin|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1941, the Dodgers captured their third [[National League pennant]], only to lose to the [[New York Yankees]]. This marked the onset of the [[Dodgers\u2013Yankees rivalry]], as the Dodgers would face them in their next six [[World Series]] appearances. Led by [[Jackie Robinson]], the first black Major League Baseball player of the modern era; and three-time National League Most Valuable Player [[Roy Campanella]], also signed out of the Negro leagues, the Dodgers captured their first [[1955 World Series|World Series title in 1955]] by defeating the Yankees for the first time, a story notably described in the 1972 book ''[[The Boys of Summer (book)|The Boys of Summer]]''.\n[[File:Fernando Valenzuela in bullpen.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Fernando Valenzuela]]]]\n\nFollowing the [[1957 Brooklyn Dodgers season|1957 season]] the team left Brooklyn. In just their second season in Los Angeles, the Dodgers won their second World Series title, beating the Chicago White Sox in six games in 1959. Spearheaded by the dominant pitching style of [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Don Drysdale]], the Dodgers captured three pennants in the 1960s and won two more World Series titles, sweeping the Yankees in four games in 1963, and edging the Minnesota Twins in seven in 1965. The 1963 sweep was their second victory against the Yankees, and their first against them as a Los Angeles team. The Dodgers won four more pennants in 1966, 1974, 1977, and 1978, but lost in each World Series appearance. They went on to win the World Series again in 1981, thanks in part to pitching sensation [[Fernando Valenzuela]].\n\nThe early 1980s were affectionately dubbed \"[[Fernandomania]]\". In 1988, another pitching hero, [[Orel Hershiser]], again led them to a World Series victory, aided by one of the most memorable home runs of all time by their star outfielder [[Kirk Gibson]] coming off the bench, despite having injuries to both knees, to pinch-hit with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of game 1, in his only appearance of the series. The Dodgers won the pennant in 2017 for the first time since their world series victory in 1988, aided by a [[Justin Turner]] walk-off home run on the same night of Gibson's iconic walk-off home run 29 years earlier. They went on to face the Houston Astros and lost in 7 games; however, the series became embroiled in controversy due to the [[Houston Astros sign stealing scandal]]. The Dodgers won the pennant in 2018 for a second year in a row, moving on to lose to the Boston Red Sox in 5 games. They went on to win the World Series again in 2020 by defeating the Tampa Bay Rays in 6 games, after playing a season shortened to 60 games due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].\n\nThe Dodgers share a fierce [[Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry|rivalry]] with the [[San Francisco Giants]], dating back to when the two franchises played in New York City.

In all, the Dodgers have appeared in 22 World Series: nine in Brooklyn and 13 in Los Angeles.\n\n==Team history==\n===Brooklyn Dodgers===\n{{Main|Brooklyn Dodgers}}\nThe Dodgers were founded in 1883 as the '''Brooklyn Atlantics''', borrowing the name of a [[Brooklyn Atlantics|defunct team]] that had played in Brooklyn before them. The team joined the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in 1884 and won the AA championship in 1889 before joining the [[National League (baseball)|National League]] in 1890. They promptly won the NL Championship in their first year in the League. The team was known alternatively as the '''Bridegrooms''', ''' Grooms, Superbas, Robins''' and '''Trolley Dodgers''', before officially becoming the '''Brooklyn Dodgers''' in the 1930s.\n\n===Jackie Robinson===\n{{Main|Jackie Robinson}}\nFor most of the first half of the 20th century, no Major League Baseball team employed an African American player. [[Jackie Robinson]] became the first African American to play for a Major League Baseball team when he played his first major league game on April 15, 1947, as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegram.com/news/20190131/as-i-see-it-happy-birthday-jack-roosevelt-robinson|title=As I See It: Happy birthday, Jack Roosevelt Robinson|last=Mitrovich|first=George|website=telegram.com|language=en|access-date=February 21, 2019|archive-date=February 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222042028/https://www.telegram.com/news/20190131/as-i-see-it-happy-birthday-jack-roosevelt-robinson|url-status=live}}</ref> This was mainly due to general manager [[Branch Rickey]]'s efforts. The deeply religious Rickey's motivation appears to have been primarily moral, although business considerations were also a factor. Rickey was a member of [[The Methodist Church (USA)|The Methodist Church]], the antecedent denomination to [[The United Methodist Church]] of today, which was a strong advocate for [[social justice]] and active later in the [[American Civil Rights Movement]].<ref name=\"The New York Times \u2013 Branch Rickey\">{{cite news | title=Branch Rickey, 83, Dies in Missouri | url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1220.html | access-date=December 29, 2008 | work=[[The New York Times]] | archive-date=July 25, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725220959/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1220.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThis event was the harbinger of the integration of professional sports in the United States, the concomitant demise of the [[Negro league baseball|Negro leagues]], and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American Civil Rights Movement. Robinson was an exceptional player, a speedy [[stolen base|runner]] who sparked the team with his intensity. He was the inaugural recipient of the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award, which is now named the Jackie Robinson Award in his honor. The Dodgers' willingness to integrate, when most other teams refused to, was a key factor in their 1947\u20131956 success. They won six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson, three-time MVP [[Roy Campanella]], Cy Young Award winner [[Don Newcombe]], [[Jim Gilliam]] and [[Joe Black]]. Robinson would eventually go on to become the first African-American elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1962.\n\n===Move to California===\n[[File:HollywoodStarsCap.png|thumb|left|upright=0.5|The [[Pacific Coast League|PCL]]'s [[Hollywood Stars]] (logo, ''pictured'') and [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Angels]] played in L.A. before the arrival of the Dodgers in 1958]]\n[[File:Dodgers Greats.JPG|thumb|Former Dodger greats who played in both Brooklyn and Los Angeles adorn the exterior of [[Dodger Stadium]].]]\nReal estate investor [[Walter O'Malley]] acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950 when he bought the 25 percent share of co-owner [[Branch Rickey]] and became allied with the widow of another equal partner, [[John L. Smith (pharmaceutical executive)|Mrs. John L. Smith]]. Shortly afterwards, he was working to buy new land in Brooklyn to build a more accessible and profitable ballpark than the aging [[Ebbets Field]]. Beloved as it was, Ebbets Field was no longer well-served by its aging infrastructure and the Dodgers could no longer sell out the park even in the heat of a pennant race, despite largely dominating the National League from 1946 to 1957.\n\nO'Malley wanted to build a [[Brooklyn Dodgers proposed domed stadium|new, state-of-the-art stadium in Brooklyn]]. But City Planner [[Robert Moses]] and New York politicians refused to grant him the eminent domain authority required to build pursuant to O'Malley's plans. To put pressure on the city, during the 1955 season, O'Malley announced that the team would play seven regular-season games and one exhibition game at Jersey City's [[Roosevelt Stadium]] in 1956.<ref name=\"Jersey City\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nl/bdodgers/brooklyn.html|title=Brooklyn Dodgers (1890\u20131957)|website=www.sportsecyclopedia.com|access-date=November 20, 2009|archive-date=October 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025002014/http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nl/bdodgers/brooklyn.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Moses and the City considered this an empty threat, and did not believe O'Malley would go through with moving the team from New York City.\n\nAfter teams began to travel to and from games by air instead of train, it became possible to include locations in the far west. Los Angeles officials attended the [[1956 World Series]] looking to the [[History of the Washington Senators|Washington Senators]] to move to the West Coast. When O'Malley heard that LA was looking for a club, he sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was interested in talking. LA offered him what New York would not: a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark, and own that ballpark, giving him complete control over all revenue streams. When the news came out, NYC Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]] and Moses made an offer to build a ballpark on the World's Fair Grounds in [[Queens]] that would be shared by the Giants and Dodgers. However, O'Malley was interested in his park under only his conditions, and the plans for a new stadium in Brooklyn seemed like a pipe dream. O'Malley decided to move the Dodgers to California, convincing Giants owner [[Horace Stoneham]] to move to San Francisco instead of Minneapolis to keep the Giants-Dodgers rivalry alive on the West Coast.<ref name=\"Jersey City\" /> They were the first MLB teams both west and south of [[St. Louis]].\n\nThe Dodgers played their final game at [[Ebbets Field]] on September 24, 1957, which the [[1957 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] won 2\u20130 over the [[1957 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]].\n\nNew York remained a one-team town with the [[New York Yankees]] until 1962, when [[Joan Payson]] founded the [[New York Mets]] and brought National League baseball back to the city. The blue background used by the Dodgers was adopted by the Mets, honoring their New York NL forebears with a blend of Dodgers blue and Giants orange.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/nym/history/timeline1.jsp |title=Mets Timeline |work=[[MLB.com]] |access-date=January 27, 2013 |archive-date=August 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807181520/http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/nym/history/timeline1.jsp |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Los Angeles Dodgers ===\n{{Main|History of the Los Angeles Dodgers}}\nThe Dodgers were the first Major League Baseball team to ever play in Los Angeles. On April 18, 1958, the Dodgers played their first LA game, defeating the former New York and now new [[1958 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], 6\u20135, before 78,672 fans at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]. Catcher [[Roy Campanella]], left partially paralyzed in an off-season accident, was never able to play in Los Angeles.\n\n[[File:LA Coliseum 1959 World Series.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[1959 World Series]] was played partially at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] while Dodger Stadium was being built.]]\nConstruction on [[Dodger Stadium]] was completed in time for Opening Day 1962. With its clean, simple lines and its picturesque setting amid hills and palm trees, the ballpark quickly became an icon of the Dodgers and their new California lifestyle. O'Malley was determined that there would not be a bad seat in the house, achieving this by [[cantilever]]ed grandstands that have since been widely imitated. More importantly for the team, the stadium's spacious dimensions, along with other factors, gave defense an advantage over offense and the Dodgers moved to take advantage of this by assembling a team that would excel with its [[pitch (baseball)|pitching]].\n\nSince moving to Los Angeles, the Dodgers have won twelve more National League Championships and seven more [[World Series ring]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://dodgerblue.com/watch-dodgers-receive-2018-nlcs-rings-dodger-stadium/2019/03/31/ | title =WATCH: Dodgers Receive 2018 NLCS Rings During Clubhouse Ceremony |

began referring to the Dodgers as the \"Bums\", in reference to the team's fans and possibly because of the \"street character\" nature of Jack Dawkins, the \"Artful Dodger\" in Charles Dickens' ''Oliver Twist''. Newspaper cartoonist [[Willard Mullin]] used a drawing of famous clown [[Emmett Kelly]] to depict \"Dem Bums\": the team would later use \"Weary Willie\" in promotional images, and Kelly himself was a club mascot during the 1950s.\n\nOther team names used by the franchise were the Atlantics, Grays, Grooms, Bridegrooms, Superbas, and Robins. All of these nicknames were used by fans and sportswriters to describe the team, but not in any official capacity. The team's legal name was the Brooklyn Base Ball Club.<ref>{{cite web | title = Brooklyn Ball Parks | url = http://www.covehurst.net/ddyte/brooklyn/dodgers.html | publisher = BrooklynBallParks.com | access-date = October 9, 2008 | archive-date = August 20, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080820160628/http://www.covehurst.net/ddyte/brooklyn/dodgers.html | url-status = live }}</ref> However, the Trolley Dodger nickname was used throughout this period, simultaneously with these other nicknames, by fans and sportswriters of the day. The team did not use the name in any formal sense until 1932 when the word \"Dodgers\" appeared on team jerseys.<ref name=\"National Baseball Hall of Fame\" /> The \"conclusive shift\" came in 1933, when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name \"Dodgers\".<ref name=\"LeonardBernardo\" />\n\nExamples of how the many popularized names of the team were used are available from newspaper articles before 1932. A New York Times article describing a game in 1916 starts out: \"Jimmy Callahan, pilot of the Pirates, did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National League pennant\", but then goes on to comment: \"the only thing that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies lost one of the two games played\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Buccaneers Rout Sleepy Superbas | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/09/14/301895812.pdf | work = [[The New York Times]] | access-date = October 8, 2008 | date = September 14, 1916 | archive-date = March 8, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210308165519/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/09/14/301895812.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref> What is interesting about the use of these two nicknames is that most baseball statistics sites and baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant-winning 1916 Brooklyn team as the Robins. A 1918 New York Times article uses the nickname in its title: \"Buccaneers Take Last From Robins\", but the subtitle of the article reads: \"Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4, Making Series An Even Break\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Buccaneers Take Last From Robins | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/05/19/98265450.pdf | work = [[The New York Times]] | access-date = October 8, 2008 | date = May 19, 1918 | archive-date = March 8, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210308045745/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/05/19/98265450.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nAnother example of the use of the many nicknames is found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the [[1920 World Series]], which identifies the matchup in the series as \"Dodgers vs. Indians\" despite the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent use for around six years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1920_World_Series_program.jpg |title=File:1920 World Series program.jpg \u2013 Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |access-date=March 29, 2012 |archive-date=November 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107211030/http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1920_World_Series_program.jpg |url-status=live }}</ref> The \"Robins\" nickname was derived from the name of their Hall of Fame manager, Wilbert Robinson, who led the team from 1914 to 1931.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-statistics.com/HOF/Robinson-Wilbert.htm |title=Wilbert Robinson |publisher=Baseball-statistics.com |date=August 8, 1934 |access-date=March 29, 2012 |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041711/http://www.baseball-statistics.com/HOF/Robinson-Wilbert.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Uniforms===\n[[File:Dodgersuni.png|thumb|The Dodgers' home uniform has remained relatively unchanged for 80 years.]]\nThe Dodgers' uniform has remained relatively unchanged since the 1930s. The home jersey is white with \"Dodgers\" written in script across the chest in royal. The road jersey is gray with \"Los Angeles\" written in script across the chest in royal.

When the franchise moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, the city name on the road jersey changed, and the stylized \"B\" was replaced with the interlocking \"LA\" on the caps in 1958. In 1970, the Dodgers removed the city name from the road jerseys and had \"Dodgers\" on both the home and away uniforms. The city script returned to the road jerseys in 1999, and the tradition-rich Dodgers flirted with an alternate uniform for the first time since 1944 (when all-blue satin uniforms were introduced).

The number font was inspired by the mid-century typefaces that were popular during the team's early years in Los Angeles. The uniform also featured two different shades of blue: cobalt and electric, while \"chili red\" was based on the chest number colors the team had worn since the 1950s. The cobalt blue cap featured the \"interlocking LA\" and script \"D\" from the \"Dodgers\" logo merged to form the LAD team code; the said logo also appears as a sleeve patch.

He is also a recipient of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]]'s [[Ford C. Frick Award]] for broadcasters (inducted in 1982). Unlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as [[play-by-play]] announcer and the other[s] as [[color commentator]]), Scully, Doggett, and Porter generally called games solo, trading with each other inning-by-inning. In the 1980s and 1990s, Scully would call the entire radio broadcast except for the third and seventh inning, allowing the other Dodger commentators to broadcast an inning. Fans and critics alike frequently praised Scully due in large part for his longevity with the team, and his ability to provide peculiar details about multiple players appearing onfield. Despite his longevity and a strong relationship with the team and fanbase, Scully was also praised for his relatively unbiased view of any game he called, often referring to the listeners as 'friends' instead of 'fans'.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Vin Scully Death, Legendary Dodger Announcer's greatest calls|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/08/03/vin-scully-dodgers-best-calls-videos#:~:text=This%20eight%2Dand%2Da%2D,a%20class%20of%20his%20own.|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|access-date=August 3, 2022| first=Dan |last=Garland |date=August 3, 2022}}</ref>\n\nWhen Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher [[Don Drysdale]], who previously broadcast games for the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] and [[Chicago White Sox]].<ref name=\"Vin Scully Retrospective\" /> Drysdale died in his hotel room following a heart attack before a game in [[Montreal]] in 1993.

Thereafter, Packer became the public address announcer for the Lakers, Kings, indoor soccer, and indoor tennis events at the Forum.\n\n[[Nick Nickson]], a radio broadcaster for the [[Los Angeles Kings]], replaced John Ramsey as the Dodger Stadium public address announcer in 1983 and served in that capacity through the 1989 season to work with the Kings full-time.\n\nDennis Packer and [[Pete Arbogast]] were emulators of John Ramsey, using the same stentorian style of announcing Ramsey was famous for.

Arbogast won the Dodgers job on the day that Ramsey died on January 25, 1990, by doing a verbatim imitation of Ramsey's opening and closing remarks that were standard at each game. His replacement, in 1994 was Mike Carlucci, who remained as the Dodgers' PA voice announcer until he resigned in 2002 to concentrate on his voiceover and acting career along with his Olympics announcing duties.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2014, the Dodgers public address announcer was Eric Smith, who also announces for the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and [[USC Trojans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.losangelesregister.com/articles/smith-600350-voice-dodgers.html|title=Orange County Register|website=Orange County Register|access-date=October 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026232311/http://www.losangelesregister.com/articles/smith-600350-voice-dodgers.html|archive-date=October 26, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn April 3, 2015, the Dodgers announced that former radio broadcaster [[Todd Leitz]] was hired to become their new public address announcer.
