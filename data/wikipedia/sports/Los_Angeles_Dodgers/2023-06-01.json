Spearheaded by the dominant pitching style of [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Don Drysdale]], the Dodgers captured three pennants in the 1960s and won two more World Series titles, sweeping the Yankees in four games in 1963, and edging the Minnesota Twins in seven in 1965. The 1963 sweep was their second victory against the Yankees, and their first against them as a Los Angeles team. The Dodgers won four more pennants in 1966, 1974, 1977 and 1978, but lost in each World Series appearance. They went on to win the World Series again in 1981, thanks in part to pitching sensation [[Fernando Valenzuela]].\n\nThe early 1980s were affectionately dubbed \"[[Fernandomania]].\" In 1988, another pitching hero, [[Orel Hershiser]], again led them to a World Series victory, aided by one of the most memorable home runs of all time by their star outfielder [[Kirk Gibson]] coming off the bench, despite having injuries to both knees, to pinch-hit with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of game 1, in his only appearance of the series.

Robinson was an exceptional player, a speedy [[stolen base|runner]] who sparked the team with his intensity. He was the inaugural recipient of the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award, which is now named the Jackie Robinson Award in his honor. The Dodgers' willingness to integrate, when most other teams refused to, was a key factor in their 1947\u20131956 success. They won six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson, three-time MVP [[Roy Campanella]], Cy Young Award winner [[Don Newcombe]], [[Jim Gilliam]] and [[Joe Black]].

Shortly afterwards, he was working to buy new land in Brooklyn to build a more accessible and profitable ballpark than the aging [[Ebbets Field]]. Beloved as it was, Ebbets Field was no longer well-served by its aging infrastructure and the Dodgers could no longer sell out the park even in the heat of a pennant race, despite largely dominating the National League from 1946 to 1957.\n\nO'Malley wanted to build a [[Brooklyn Dodgers proposed domed stadium|new, state-of-the-art stadium in Brooklyn]]. But City Planner [[Robert Moses]] and New York politicians refused to grant him the eminent domain authority required to build pursuant to O'Malley's plans. To put pressure on the city, during the 1955 season, O'Malley announced that the team would play seven regular-season games and one exhibition game at Jersey City's [[Roosevelt Stadium]] in 1956.<ref name=\"Jersey City\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nl/bdodgers/brooklyn.html|title=Brooklyn Dodgers (1890-1957)|website=www.sportsecyclopedia.com}}</ref> Moses and the City considered this an empty threat, and did not believe O'Malley would go through with moving the team from New York City.\n\nAfter teams began to travel to and from games by air instead of train, it became possible to include locations in the far west. Los Angeles officials attended the [[1956 World Series]] looking to the [[History of the Washington Senators|Washington Senators]] to move to the West Coast. When O'Malley heard that LA was looking for a club, he sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was interested in talking. LA offered him what New York would not: a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark, and own that ballpark, giving him complete control over all revenue streams. When the news came out, NYC Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]] and Moses made an offer to build a ballpark on the World's Fair Grounds in [[Queens]] that would be shared by the Giants and Dodgers. However, O'Malley was interested in his park under only his conditions, and the plans for a new stadium in Brooklyn seemed like a pipe dream. O'Malley decided to move the Dodgers to California, convincing Giants owner [[Horace Stoneham]] to move to San Francisco instead of Minneapolis to keep the Giants-Dodgers rivalry alive on the West Coast.<ref name=\"Jersey City\" />\n\nThe Dodgers played their final game at [[Ebbets Field]] on September 24, 1957, which the [[1957 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] won 2\u20130 over the [[1957 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]].\n\nNew York remained a one-team town with the [[New York Yankees]] until 1962, when [[Joan Payson]] founded the [[New York Mets]] and brought National League baseball back to the city. The blue background used by the Dodgers was adopted by the Mets, honoring their New York NL forebears with a blend of Dodgers blue and Giants orange.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/nym/history/timeline1.jsp |title=Mets Timeline &#124; Mets.com: History |work=[[MLB.com]] |access-date=2013-01-27 |archive-date=August 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807181520/http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/nym/history/timeline1.jsp |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Los Angeles Dodgers===\n{{Main|History of the Los Angeles Dodgers}}\nThe Dodgers were the first Major League Baseball team to ever play in Los Angeles. On April 18, 1958, the Dodgers played their first LA game, defeating the former New York and now new [[1958 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], 6\u20135, before 78,672 fans at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]. Catcher [[Roy Campanella]], left partially paralyzed in an off-season accident, was never able to play in Los Angeles.\n\n[[File:LA Coliseum 1959 World Series.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[1959 World Series]] was played partially at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] while Dodger Stadium was being built.]]\nConstruction on [[Dodger Stadium]] was completed in time for Opening Day 1962. With its clean, simple lines and its picturesque setting amid hills and palm trees, the ballpark quickly became an icon of the Dodgers and their new California lifestyle. O'Malley was determined that there would not be a bad seat in the house, achieving this by [[cantilever]]ed grandstands that have since been widely imitated. More importantly for the team, the stadium's spacious dimensions, along with other factors, gave defense an advantage over offense and the Dodgers moved to take advantage of this by assembling a team that would excel with its [[pitch (baseball)|pitching]].\n\nSince moving to Los Angeles, the Dodgers have won 12 more National League Championships and six more [[World Series ring]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://dodgerblue.com/watch-dodgers-receive-2018-nlcs-rings-dodger-stadium/2019/03/31/| title =WATCH: Dodgers Receive 2018 NLCS Rings During Clubhouse Ceremony | publisher =Dodger Blue | date =March 31, 2019 }}</ref>\n[[File:Vic Correll -1978.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|In-game action at [[Dodger Stadium]], 1978]]\n\n==Other historical notes==\n===Historical records and firsts===\n*First baseball team to win championships in different leagues in consecutive years (1889\u20131890)\n*First television broadcast (1939)\n*First use of batting helmets (1941)\n*First MLB team to employ and start an African-American player in the 20th century ([[Jackie Robinson]], 1947)\n*First MLB team to have numbers on the front of their uniforms (1952)\n*First West Coast team (1958) \u2013 along with the San Francisco Giants\n*First Western team to win a World Series (1959)\n*First MLB team to allow a female sports journalist into a locker room ([[Anita Martini]], 1974)\n*First MLB team to establish a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic when they opened the doors to Campo Las Palmas (1987)\n*Largest home-opener attendance: 78,672 (1958) (since broken by the [[Colorado Rockies]] in 1993)\n*Largest single game attendance: 93,103 (1959) and 115,300 (2008) *World Record\n*First MLB team to open an office in Asia (1998)\n*Longest MLB record for home start going 13\u20130 (2009)\n*North American record for the buying of a sports team ($2&nbsp;billion, 2012)\n*Most [[List of Major League Baseball no-hitters|no-hitters]] (26)\n*Most [[Cy Young award]] winners (12)\n*First MLB team to employ a female lead trainer (Sue Falsone, 2012)\n*11,000 franchise wins 8-30-2020 (vs Texas)\n*Most runs scored in a single inning of a postseason game (11 runs in 2020 NLCS Game 3, 2020)\n*Most Rookie of the Year awards (18) \n*First team to draw 3&nbsp;million fans\n*First team to have a pair of two-slam games in a season (2021)\n\n===Origin of the nickname===\nThe Dodgers' official history reports that the term \"Trolley Dodgers\" was attached to the Brooklyn ballclub due to the [[List of streetcar lines in Brooklyn|complex maze of trolley cars]] that weaved its way through the borough of Brooklyn.<ref name=\"DodgersTimeline1890s\">{{cite web|title=Franchise Timeline - 1890s|url=https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/history/timeline-1890s|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dodgers.com|access-date=June 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1892, the city of Brooklyn (Brooklyn was an independent city until annexed by New York City in 1898) began replacing its slow-moving, horse-drawn trolley lines with the faster, more powerful electric trolley lines.<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Peter Jensen|title=The Grim Reality of the \"Trolley Dodgers\"|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-grim-reality-of-trolley-dodgers.html|work=Early Sports and Pop-Culture History Blog|access-date=9 April 2014|date=April 7, 2014}}</ref> Within less than three years, by the end of 1895, electric trolley accidents in Brooklyn had resulted in more than 130 deaths and maimed well over 500 people.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Christian Work|date=January 2, 1896|volume=60|page=10}}</ref> Brooklyn's high profile, the significant number of widely reported accidents, and a trolley strike in early 1895, combined to create a strong association in the public's mind between Brooklyn and trolley dodging.<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\nSportswriters started using the name \"Trolley Dodgers\" to refer to the Brooklyn team early in the 1895 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026355/1895-05-11/ed-1/seq-10/|newspaper=The Scranton Tribune|date=May 11, 1895|title=Notes of the Diamond}}</ref> The name was shortened to, on occasion, the \"Brooklyn Dodgers\" as early as 1898.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1898-04-25/ed-1/seq-10/|access-date=9 April 2014|newspaper=Evening Star (Washington DC)|date=April 25, 1898|title=Current Sporting Notes}}</ref>\n\nSportswriters in the early 20th century began referring to the Dodgers as the \"Bums\", in reference to the team's fans and possibly because of the \"street character\" nature of Jack Dawkins, the \"Artful Dodger\" in Charles Dickens' ''Oliver Twist''. Newspaper cartoonist [[Willard Mullin]] used a drawing of famous clown [[Emmett Kelly]] to depict \"Dem Bums\": the team would later use \"Weary Willie\" in promotional images, and Kelly himself was a club mascot during the 1950s.\n\nOther team names used by the franchise were the Atlantics, Grays, Grooms, Bridegrooms, Superbas and Robins. All of these nicknames were used by fans and sportswriters to describe the team, but not in any official capacity. The team's legal name was the Brooklyn Base Ball Club.<ref>{{cite web | title = Brooklyn Ball Parks | url = http://www.covehurst.net/ddyte/brooklyn/dodgers.html | publisher=BrooklynBallParks.com | access-date =October 9, 2008}}</ref> However, the Trolley Dodger nickname was used throughout this period, simultaneously with these other nicknames, by fans and sportswriters of the day. The team did not use the name in any formal sense until 1932, when the word \"Dodgers\" appeared on team jerseys.<ref name=\"National Baseball Hall of Fame\" /> The \"conclusive shift\" came in 1933, when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name \"Dodgers\".<ref name=\"LeonardBernardo\" />\n\nExamples of how the many popularized names of the team were used are available from newspaper articles before 1932. A New York Times article describing a game in 1916 starts out: \"Jimmy Callahan, pilot of the Pirates, did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National League pennant\", but then goes on to comment: \"the only thing that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies lost one of the two games played\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Buccaneers Rout Sleepy Superbas | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/09/14/301895812.pdf |work=[[The New York Times]] | access-date =October 8, 2008 | date=September 14, 1916}}</ref> What is interesting about the use of these two nicknames is that most baseball statistics sites and baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant-winning 1916 Brooklyn team as the Robins. A 1918 New York Times article uses the nickname in its title: \"Buccaneers Take Last From Robins\", but the subtitle of the article reads: \"Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4, Making Series An Even Break\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Buccaneers Take Last From Robins | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/05/19/98265450.pdf |work=[[The New York Times]] | access-date =October 8, 2008 | date=May 19, 1918}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of the use of the many nicknames is found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the [[1920 World Series]], which identifies the matchup in the series as \"Dodgers vs. Indians\" despite the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent use for around six years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1920_World_Series_program.jpg |title=File:1920 World Series program.jpg \u2013 Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |access-date=March 29, 2012}}</ref> The \"Robins\" nickname was derived from the name of their Hall of Fame manager, Wilbert Robinson, who led the team from 1914 to 1931.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-statistics.com/HOF/Robinson-Wilbert.htm |title=Wilbert Robinson |publisher=Baseball-statistics.com |date=August 8, 1934 |access-date=March 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Uniforms===\n[[File:Dodgersuni.png|thumb|The Dodgers' home uniform has remained relatively unchanged for 80 years.]]\nThe Dodgers' uniform has remained relatively unchanged since the 1930s. The home jersey is white with \"Dodgers\" written in script across the chest in royal. The road jersey is gray with \"Los Angeles\" written in script across the chest in royal. The word \"Dodgers\" was first used on the front of the team's home jersey in 1933; the uniform was then white with red pinstripes and a stylized \"B\" on the left shoulder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dodgers Uniforms & Logos|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/la/history/uniforms_logos.jsp|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=Dodgers.com|access-date=October 21, 2018}}</ref> The Dodgers also wore green outlined uniforms and green caps throughout the 1937 season but reverted to blue the following year.\n\n[[File:Los Angeles Dodgers Script Logo.svg|thumb|The Dodgers current script on a Dodger Blue background]]\nThe current design was created in 1939, and has remained the same ever since with only cosmetic changes. Originally intended for the [[1951 World Series]] for which the ballclub failed to qualify, red numbers under the \"Dodgers\" script were added to the home uniform in [[1952 Brooklyn Dodgers season|1952]].<ref>[https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7353/10312192794_6541eb9f17_o.png Ruhl, Oscar. \"From the Ruhl Book\" (column), ''The Sporting News'', April 30, 1952.] Retrieved August 6, 2019</ref> The road jersey also has a red uniform number under the script. When the franchise moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, the city name on the road jersey changed, and the stylized \"B\" was replaced with the interlocking \"LA\" on the caps in 1958. In 1970, the Dodgers removed the city name from the road jerseys and had \"Dodgers\" on both the home and away uniforms. The city script returned to the road jerseys in 1999, and the tradition-rich Dodgers flirted with an alternate uniform for the first time since 1944 (when all-blue satin uniforms were introduced). These 1999 alternate jerseys had a royal top with the \"Dodgers\" script in white across the chest, and the red number on the front. These were worn with white pants and a new cap with silver brim, top button and Dodger logo. These alternates proved unpopular and the team abandoned them after only one season. In 2014, the Dodgers introduced an alternate road jersey: a gray version with the \"Dodgers\" script instead of the city name.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nowak|first=Joey|title=Dodgers to wear road jersey featuring team name|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/dodgers-to-wear-road-jersey-featuring-team-name/c-67285998|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dodgers.com|date=January 30, 2014|access-date=June 14, 2018}}</ref> Since its introduction, however, the road jersey with the \"Dodgers\" script was used more often than the road jersey with the \"Los Angeles\" script, so much that the team now considers it as a primary road uniform.<ref>{{citation|title=Dodgers uniform lineups since 2012|url=https://uniformlineup.com/Lineups/lad-lineups.html|website=UniformLineup.com|access-date=April 7, 2021}}</ref> In 2018, the Dodgers wore their 60th anniversary patch to honor the 60 years of being in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gurnick|first=Ken|title=Dodgers celebrate 60 years of playing in LA|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/dodgers-celebrate-60-years-of-playing-in-la/c-265205462|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dodgers.com|date=January 23, 2018|access-date=June 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dodgers unveil 60th anniversary logo|url=http://beverlypress.com/2018/01/dodgers-unveil-60th-anniversary-logo/|website=Park Labrea News/ Beverly Press|access-date=March 26, 2018|date=January 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2021, the Dodgers again unveiled a blue alternate uniform, this time as part of the \"City Connect\" series in collaboration with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. This uniform was similar to the blue alternates they wore in 1999, but with the script \"Los Dodgers\" in homage to Los Angeles' [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] community. The uniform is also worn with blue pants, and black stripes are added to the sleeves. Initially, the Dodgers wore a special blue cap with the \"Los Dodgers\" script, but switched in 2022 to a blue interlocking \"LA\" cap with black brim. The \"Los Dodgers\" script was then relocated to the right side.

In the 2008 season, the Dodgers had the most Asian players on its roster of any major league team with five. They included Japanese pitchers [[Takashi Saito (baseball)|Takashi Saito]] and [[Hiroki Kuroda]]; South Korean pitcher [[Chan Ho Park]]; and Taiwanese pitcher [[Hong-Chih Kuo]] and infielder [[Chin-Lung Hu]].

The Dodgers' rivalries with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] also dates back to their days in New York, but were most fierce during the 1970s, 1980s, and 2000s. The Dodgers also shared a heated rivalry with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The Dodgers' had even shared a rather volatile rivalry with divisional foes; the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] during most of the 2010s. Their intra-city rivalry with the [[Los Angeles Angels]] dates back to the Angels' inaugural season in 1961. The Dodgers have recently revived an old Southern California based rivalry with the [[San Diego Padres]] dating back to the Padres' inaugural season in 1969.

This was the year in which Koufax was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame; Robinson and Campanella were already Hall-of-Famers.\n\nAlston's number was retired in the year following his retirement as the Dodgers manager, six years before he was inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nGilliam died suddenly in 1978 after a 28-year career with the Dodgers organization. The Dodgers retired his number two days after his death, prior to Game 1 of the [[1978 World Series]]. As of 2018, he is the only non-Hall-of-Famer to have his number retired by the Dodgers (Alston's number was retired before he was elected to the Hall of Fame).\n\nBeginning in 1980, the Dodgers have retired the numbers of longtime Dodgers (Snider, Reese, Drysdale, Lasorda, Sutton, and Hodges) during the seasons in which each was inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1997, 50 years after he broke the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]] and 25 years after the Dodgers retired his number, Robinson's No. 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball. Robinson is the only major league baseball player to have this honor bestowed upon him. Starting in the 2007 season, [[Jackie Robinson Day]] (April 15, commemorating Opening Day of Robinson's rookie season of 1947) has featured many or all players and coaches wearing the number 42 as a tribute to Robinson.\n\nIn 2017, the Dodgers honored broadcaster Vin Scully with a microphone displayed alongside the team's retired numbers.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-dodgers-report-20170503-story.html Vin Scully has microphone retired at Dodger Stadium ceremony]</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Spanish language broadcaster Jaime Jarr\u00edn was honored with a microphone displayed alongside the team's retired numbers.<ref>[https://mynewsla.com/sports/2018/09/21/jaime-jarrin-inducted-to-dodger-stadium-ring-of-honor/ Jaime Jarrin Inducted to Dodger Stadium Ring of Honor]</ref>\n\n====Out of circulation, but not retired====\nThe Dodgers have not issued the number '''34''' since the departure of [[Fernando Valenzuela]] in 1991 and have plans to officially retire the number during the 2023 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/dodgers-to-retire-fernando-valenzuelas-number?fbclid=IwAR3Mjs493ZJKMMkjlx7Yp3v_FzvOlCBoqtCfYiitIMj41Wc1Yet3rOd0jpE|title=Dodgers to retire Valenzuela's No. 34|work=MLB.com|date=February 4, 2023|access-date=February 4, 2023}}</ref>\n\n===Legends of Dodger Baseball===\nIn 2019, the Dodgers established \"Legends of Dodger Baseball\", which is to meant honor Dodger greats.

During this entire time period of extraordinary stability, the Dodgers were family-owned by [[Walter O'Malley]] and then his son [[Peter O'Malley]]. It was during this era that the Dodgers won 11 of their 24 pennants, and their first six World Series championships.\n\nThe managers of the Los Angeles Dodgers (1958\u2013present) are as follows:\n*[[Walter Alston]] (1958\u20131976) (in Brooklyn since 1954)\n*[[Tommy Lasorda]] (1976\u20131996)\n*[[Bill Russell (shortstop)|Bill Russell]] (1996\u20131998)\n*[[Glenn Hoffman]] (1998)\n*[[Davey Johnson]] (1999\u20132000)\n*[[Jim Tracy (baseball)|Jim Tracy]] (2001\u20132005)\n*[[Grady Little]] (2006\u20132007)\n*[[Joe Torre]] (2008\u20132010)\n*[[Don Mattingly]] (2011\u20132015)\n*[[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] (2016\u2013present)\n\n===General Managers===\n*[[Larry MacPhail]] (1938\u20131942)\n*[[Branch Rickey]] (1943\u20131950)\n*[[Buzzie Bavasi]] (1950\u20131968)\n*[[Fresco Thompson]] (1968)\n*[[Al Campanis]] (1968\u20131987)\n*[[Fred Claire]] (1987\u20131998)\n*[[Tommy Lasorda]] (1998)\n*[[Kevin Malone (baseball)|Kevin Malone]] (1999\u20132001)\n*[[Dave Wallace (baseball)|Dave Wallace]] (2001)\n*[[Dan Evans (baseball)|Dan Evans]] (2001\u20132004)\n*[[Paul DePodesta]] (2004\u20132005)\n*[[Ned Colletti]] (2005\u20132014)\n*[[Farhan Zaidi]] (2014\u20132018)\n*[[Brandon Gomes]] (2022\u2013present)\n\n===Public address announcers/organists===\n\nFrom the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles from Brooklyn in 1958, the Dodgers employed a handful of well-known public address announcers; the most famous of which was [[John Ramsey (announcer)|John Ramsey]], who served as the PA voice of the Dodgers from 1958 until his retirement in 1982; he was also well known for announcing at other venerable Los Angeles venues, including the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] and [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena|Sports Arena]], and the [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Forum]]. Ramsey died in 1990.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1982, Doug Moore, Philip Petty, and Dennis Packer served as back-up voices for John Ramsey for the Dodgers, California Angels, Los Angeles Chargers, USC football and Los Angeles Rams. Packer was Ramsey's primary backup for the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings until Ramsey's retirement from the Forum in 1978. Thereafter, Packer became the public address announcer for the Lakers, Kings, indoor soccer and indoor tennis events at the Forum.\n\n[[Nick Nickson]], a radio broadcaster for the [[Los Angeles Kings]], replaced John Ramsey as the Dodger Stadium public address announcer in 1983 and served in that capacity through the 1989 season to work with the Kings full-time.\n\nDennis Packer and [[Pete Arbogast]] were emulators of John Ramsey, using the same stentorian style of announcing Ramsey was famous for. Packer and Arbogast shared the stadium announcing chores for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] matches at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]]. Arbogast won the Dodgers job on the day that Ramsey died on January 25, 1990, by doing a verbatim imitation of Ramsey's opening and closing remarks that were standard at each game. His replacement, in 1994 was Mike Carlucci, who remained as the Dodgers' PA voice announcer until he resigned in 2002 to concentrate on his voiceover and acting career along with his Olympics announcing duties.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2014, the Dodgers public address announcer was Eric Smith, who also announces for the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and [[USC Trojans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.losangelesregister.com/articles/smith-600350-voice-dodgers.html|title=Orange County Register|website=Orange County Register|access-date=October 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026232311/http://www.losangelesregister.com/articles/smith-600350-voice-dodgers.html|archive-date=October 26, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn April 3, 2015, the Dodgers announced that former radio broadcaster [[Todd Leitz]] was hired to become their new public address announcer.
