This happened notably in North Carolina. In 1935, Bill France Sr. established races in Daytona Beach, with the hope that people would come to watch races, and that racers would race for him, as other organizers tended to fleece the winners of their payouts. This was a success, and the series was founded in 1948. Races were held in several divisions, which eventually morphed into what is the \"ladder:\" the [[NASCAR Cup Series|Cup Series]] at the top, the [[NASCAR Xfinity Series|Xfinity Series]] second, and the [[NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|Truck Series]] third, with smaller series spread out below. Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota compete in each series.\n\nThe vast majority of NASCAR drivers are American, but drivers from Canada, Mexico, Europe, and other places have competed. All Cup Series races are held across America. There are 36 points-paying races in a season, along with the pre-season Clash and mid-season All-Star race. NASCAR runs races primarily on [[Oval track racing|ovals]], including superspeedways, short tracks, and [[Dirt track racing|dirt tracks]], but also [[Road racing|road courses]] and [[Street circuit|street circuits]].\n\n[[Richard Petty]] holds the Cup Series wins record with 200, and ties with [[Dale Earnhardt]] and [[Jimmie Johnson]] for the championship record, with seven each.

The season would begin in January 1947 at the Daytona Beach track, and conclude in Jacksonville the following December. Nearly 40 events were logged during the season, and attendance often exceeded the venue's capacity.

The race was held on June 19, 1949 and won by driver [[Jim Roper]] when [[Glenn Dunaway]] was disqualified after the discovery of his altered rear springs. Initially, the cars were known as the \"Strictly Stock Division\" and raced with virtually no modifications on the factory models. This division was renamed the \"Grand National\" division beginning in the 1950 season. Over a period of more than a decade, modifications for both safety and performance were allowed, and by the mid-1960s, the vehicles were purpose-built race cars with a stock-appearing body.\n\n[[File:RichardPettyRoadrunner.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Petty]]'s 1970 426 C.I.

It is consequently the most popular and most profitable NASCAR series. Since 2001, the Cup Series season has consisted of 36 races over 10 months. Writers and fans often use \"Cup\" to refer to the NCS and the ambiguous use of \"NASCAR\" as a synonym for the series is common. The 2022 NCS Champion is [[Joey Logano]]. The record for most championships is 7, held by three drivers: [[Richard Petty]], [[Dale Earnhardt]], and [[Jimmie Johnson]]. Johnson has the record for most consecutive with five consecutive Cup Series drivers' championships from 2006 to 2010. Previously, the most consecutive championships had been three in a row by [[Cale Yarborough]] in the late 1970s, the only other time when a driver has won three or more NASCAR Cup Series championships in a row.\n\nThe Cup Series had its first [[Naming rights|title sponsor]] in 1972. [[Reynolds American Inc.|R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]], which had been [[Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act|banned from television]] [[Tobacco advertising|advertising]], found a popular and demographically suitable consumer base in NASCAR fans and engaged NASCAR as a promotional outlet. As a result of that sponsorship, the Grand National Series became known as the Winston Cup Series<!-- This is referring to the past, so leave it as it is here. --> starting in 1971,<ref name=\"Fielden_Chron\" /> with a new points system and some significant cash benefits to compete for championship points. In 1972, the season was shortened from 48 races (including two on [[Dirt track racing|dirt tracks]]) to 31.<ref name=\"Fielden_Chron\">Fielden, Greg. ''NASCAR Chronicle''. Publications International, Ltd., Lincolnwood, Illinois, USA, 2006. p. 36.</ref> 1972 is often acknowledged as the beginning of NASCAR's \"modern era\". The next competitive level, called Late Model Sportsman, gained the \"Grand National\" title passed down from the top division and soon found a sponsor in [[Busch Beer]].\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt Jr and team in the winners circle photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Dale Earnhardt Jr. (bottom), and team in victory lane in 2004]]\nIn 2004, [[Nextel Communications]] took over sponsorship of the premier series, and formally renamed it the Nextel Cup Series. A new championship points system, the \"[[Chase for the Sprint Cup|Chase for the Nextel Cup]],\" (renamed \"Chase for the Sprint Cup\" in 2008) was also developed, which reset the point standings with ten races to go, making only drivers in the top ten or within 400 points of the leader eligible to win the championship. In 2007, NASCAR announced it was expanding \"The Chase\" from ten to twelve drivers, eliminating the 400-point cutoff, and giving a ten-point bonus to the top twelve drivers for each of the races they have won out of the first 26. Wins throughout the season would also be awarded five more points than in previous seasons. In 2008, the premier series title name became the Sprint Cup Series, as part of the merger between Nextel and [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]].\n\nIn 2011, NASCAR announced a number of major rules changes, the most significant being abandoning the points system. The winner of a race now receives 43 points, with one-point decrements for each subsequent position (42 for second, 41 for third, and so on). The winner also receives 3 bonus points, and single bonus points are awarded to all drivers who lead a lap, plus the driver who leads the most laps. Another significant change involves the qualifying process for the Chase. The number of qualifying drivers will remain at 12, but only the top 10 will qualify solely on regular-season points. The remaining two Chase drivers will be the two drivers in the next 10 of the point standings (11th through 20th) with the most race wins in the regular season.\n\nIn 2014, NASCAR announced another revamp to the Chase format, expanding the Chase pool to 16 drivers, and eliminating four drivers after every three races, leaving four drivers to compete for the championship at the season finale at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead]]. In addition, wins were given an increased emphasis, with the 16 drivers with the most wins (15 if the points leader is winless; points leader will receive an automatic berth) gaining a spot in the chase. If there are fewer than 16 winners, the remaining spots will be filled based on the conventional points system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/30/chase-for-the-nascar-sprint-cup-championship-format-changes.html|title=NASCAR Announces Chase for the Sprint Cup Format Change|work=NASCAR.com|date=January 30, 2014|access-date=August 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813113713/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/30/chase-for-the-nascar-sprint-cup-championship-format-changes.html|archive-date=August 13, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/30/chase-for-the-nascar-sprint-cup-championship-format-changes.html|title=NASCAR Announces Chase for the Sprint Cup Format Change|date=January 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131093256/https://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/30/chase-for-the-nascar-sprint-cup-championship-format-changes.html|access-date=September 14, 2019|archive-date=January 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Monster Energy]] became the title sponsor in 2017, which changed the series' name to Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2016/12/01/monster-energy-title-sponsor-nascar-cup-series/94748244/|title=Monster Energy replaces Sprint as title sponsor for NASCAR's top series|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=December 1, 2016|access-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref> With Monster Energy's title sponsorship, NASCAR also abandoned \"The Chase\" name and now refers to the last 10 races simply as \"the playoffs\" similar to most other sports.\n\nAfter the 2019 season, NASCAR declined an offer from Monster Energy to remain the title sponsor of the top series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2019/04/08/nascar-moves-toward-new-title-sponsor-model-despite-monsters-offer/|title=NASCAR moves toward new sponsor model despite Monster's offer|last=Ryan|first=Nate|date=2019-04-08|website=NASCAR Talk|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> On December 5, NASCAR revealed their new sponsorship model.

The most recent series champion is [[Ty Gibbs]] in 2022. The modern incarnation of this series began in 1982, with sponsorship by [[Anheuser-Busch|Anheuser-Busch Brewing]]'s [[Budweiser]] brand. In 1984 it was renamed to the Busch Grand National Series, then later just the Busch Series. The Anheuser-Busch sponsorship expired at the end of 2007, being replaced by [[Nationwide Insurance]] from 2008 to 2014, and the series is now sponsored by [[Comcast]] through its [[Xfinity]] brand.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Nate|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2013/09/18/nascar-nationwide-ends-title-sponsorship-2014/2830629/|title=Nationwide to end sponsorship of NASCAR's No. 2 series|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=September 18, 2013|access-date=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe season usually has fewer races than the Cup Series, and the prize money is significantly lower. However, over the last several years, a number of Cup Series drivers have run both the Xfinity and Cup Series events each weekend, using the Xfinity race as a warm-up to the Cup event at the same facility. Furthermore, several drivers not only participated in both Cup and Busch/Nationwide/Xfinity events on the same weekend but also began to compete in both series on a full-time basis. [[Kevin Harvick]] was the first Cup series driver to compete full-time in the Busch Series and win a title, actually doing so twice; in 2001, he did this for [[Richard Childress Racing]] but only did so out of necessity as [[Dale Earnhardt]]'s death forced him into the Cup series ahead of RCR's intended schedule for him. His win in 2006, where he raced three cars for RCR and [[Kevin Harvick, Inc.|his race team]], was the first of five consecutive titles in NBS/NNS that were won by Cup series regulars.\n\n[[File:Road America 2011 Nationwide Final Spin.jpg|thumb|left|The Nationwide (now Xfinity) Series at [[Road America]] in 2011, using the [[Car of Tomorrow]] design]]\nThe practice received criticism because it was thought to give the Cup Series teams an unfair advantage, and that the presence of the Cup Series drivers squeezes out Nationwide Series competitors who would otherwise be able to qualify. These dual-series drivers have been labeled \"[[Buschwhacker]]s\", a play on words which combines the original series sponsor's name with the notion of being bushwhacked. In May 2007, NNS director Joe Balash confirmed that NASCAR was exploring options to deal with the Buschwhacker controversy. One of the most often-cited proposals was for Cup Series drivers participating in the Nationwide Series to receive no points for their participation in a Nationwide race. In 2007, NASCAR chairman [[Brian France]] indicated that all options, except an outright ban of Cup competitors, were still being considered.<ref name=\"toy-buschwackers\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theworldlink.com/articles/2007/12/09/sports/doc475a2b87dea14790115682.txt |title=NASCAR toying with ideas for 'Buschwhackers'|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|date=December 9, 2007|work=AP Auto Racing Writer|publisher=The World Link, Southwestern Oregon Publishing Company|access-date=April 17, 2009}}</ref> On January 11, 2011, ''NASCAR.com'' reported that beginning with the 2011 season, drivers would be allowed to compete for the championship in only one of NASCAR's three national series in a given season, although they could continue to run in multiple series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nascar.com/news/110110/rule-change-drivers-one-championship/index.html |title=NASCAR drivers must elect championships in '11 |first=Dave |last=Rodman |work=NASCAR.com |date=January 11, 2011 |access-date=January 11, 2011 |archive-date=January 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112113703/http://www.nascar.com/news/110110/rule-change-drivers-one-championship/index.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> This change was officially confirmed by France in a press conference less than two weeks later, and has remained in the NASCAR rules ever since.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.nascar.com/news/110126/nascar-rules-changes/index.html |title=Changes for 2011 include emphasis on winning&nbsp;\u2013 January 26, 2011 |publisher=NASCAR |date=January 26, 2011 |access-date=July 15, 2011 |archive-date=January 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130061833/http://www.nascar.com/news/110126/nascar-rules-changes/index.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 2010, the Nationwide cars adapted somewhat to the current \"[[Car of Tomorrow]]\" (or COT) design used by Cup cars, with different bodies from the Cup Series.\n\nIn 2016, the Chase format was extended to both the Xfinity and Truck Series.

The Xfinity Series Chase involves 12 drivers instead of the 16 participating in the Cup Series Chase. Four drivers are eliminated at the end of each preliminary round of the Chase in the Xfinity Series, which also mirrors the Cup Series Chase.

The first series race followed in 1995. In 1996, the series was renamed the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series to emphasize Craftsman's involvement. The series was first considered something of an oddity or a \"senior tour\" for NASCAR drivers, but eventually grew in popularity and has seen drivers move straight to the Cup Series without running a full season in [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]] competition. These include [[Kurt Busch]] and [[Carl Edwards]] (who both ran for [[Roush Fenway Racing|Roush Racing]]). In addition, veteran drivers who have had only moderate success at the other two levels of the sport have revitalized their careers in the truck series, including [[Ron Hornaday Jr.]], [[Todd Bodine]], [[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|Mike Skinner]], and [[Johnny Benson]].\n\nBeginning in 2009, the series became the [[Camping World]] Truck Series.<ref name=\"Truck-Camping World Title\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/headlines/truck/10/24/truck.camping.world.sponsor/index.html|title=Camping World to be title sponsor for Truck Series|last=Official Release|date=October 24, 2008|publisher=nascar.com, Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|access-date=April 17, 2009|archive-date=April 20, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420185525/http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/headlines/truck/10/24/truck.camping.world.sponsor/index.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2019, per a branding request made by Camping World, the series was rebranded as the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2018/07/28/gander-outdoor-truck-series-logo-revealed/|title=Logo revealed for NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series &#124; NASCAR.com|date=July 29, 2018|website=Official Site Of NASCAR}}</ref>\n\nAs noted previously, the Chase format was extended to the Truck Series in 2016.

The east division was originally divided into the Busch North series, which raced in Northeastern states, and the Busch East Series, which raced throughout Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. The west division was originally known as the Winston West Series and raced throughout Southwestern and Coastal Pacific states. In 2008, the series came together in east and west divisions under sponsorship from [[Camping World]] as the Camping World Series. [[K&N Engineering|K&N Filters]] took over the sponsorship in 2010. 2019 was the last season for both of the series before they are to go under the ARCA banner in 2020 as part of the unification of the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East and West and the ARCA Menards Series. The series became known as the '''ARCA Menards Series East''' and '''ARCA Menards Series West''' starting in 2020, meaning 2019 was also K&N's last year as the series title sponsor.\n\n====AutoZone Elite and other divisions====\n{{main|NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Southeast Series|NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Northwest Series|NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Southwest Series|NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Midwest Series}}\nIn the past, NASCAR also sanctioned the AutoZone Elite Division, which raced late-model cars that were lighter and less powerful than Cup Series cars, and was originally split into four divisions: Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, and Midwest. At the end of 2005, NASCAR announced that the AutoZone Elite Division would be discontinued after the 2006 season due to having trouble securing NASCAR-sanctioned tracks to successfully host AutoZone Elite Division events, plus escalating costs of competing and downsizing of the Division in recent years. In 2003, NASCAR standardized rules for its AutoZone Elite and Grand National divisions regional touring series as to permit cars in one series to race against cars in another series in the same division. The top 15 (Grand National) or 10 (AutoZone Elite) in each series will race in a one-race playoff, called the NASCAR Toyota All-Star Showdown, to determine the annual AutoZone Elite and Grand National champions. This event has been hosted at [[Irwindale Speedway]] in California since its inception.\n\nMany drivers move up through the series before reaching the Cup Series. In 2002, over 9,000 drivers had licenses from NASCAR to race at all levels.\n\nThe winners of the All-American Series National Championship, the ARCA Menards Series, ARCA East and ARCA West championships, the Whelen Modified and Grand National Divisions, and the three national series are invited to Las Vegas in December to participate in Champions Week ceremonies.\n\n===Online racing series===\n\n====eNASCAR Coca-Cola iRacing Series====\n{{main|eNASCAR Coca-Cola iRacing Series}}\n\nIn 2010, NASCAR officially sanctioned its first sim racing [[eSports]] series, partnering with ''[[iRacing]]'' to form the NASCAR iRacing.com Series. This [[sim racing]] series is made of up of five \"Amateur Series\" divisions, the NASCAR iRacing.com Pro Series, and the PEAK Antifreeze NASCAR iRacing Series (NPAiS), one of iRacing's World Championship Series. Each year, the champion of the NASCAR iRacing.com World Championship Series is invited to NASCAR's Championship Weekend at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]] to receive $10,500 prize money and NASCAR championship trophy at the track.\n\nIn 2018, ''iRacing'' announced a new, sanctioned qualifying ladder system for the NPAiS, the Road to Pro Series, using virtual Chevrolet and Toyota Camping World Trucks.
