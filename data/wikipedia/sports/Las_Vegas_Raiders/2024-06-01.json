The Raiders compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division. The team plays home games at [[Allegiant Stadium]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]], and is headquartered in [[Henderson, Nevada]].\n\nFounded on January 30, 1960, and originally based in [[Oakland, California]],  the Raiders played their first regular season game on September 11, 1960, as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL). They moved to the NFL with the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] in 1970. The team was almost chosen under the nickname \"Se\u00f1ors\" when established, as close to the team sporting the \"Oakland Se\u00f1ors\" team name is the original idea of the orange and black team theme colors, that were discontinued as well. The team departed Oakland to play in [[Los Angeles]] from the 1982 season through the 1994 season before returning to Oakland at the start of the 1995 season. On March 27, 2017, NFL team owners voted nearly unanimously to approve the Raiders' application to [[Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas|relocate]] to Las Vegas. Nearly three years later, on January 22, 2020, the Raiders moved to Las Vegas.<ref name=\"JScottNFL\">{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Jelani|title=Raiders officially announce 'Las Vegas Raiders' title|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001098555/article/raiders-officially-announce-las-vegas-raiders-title|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=January 22, 2020|access-date=January 23, 2020|archive-date=January 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200123155343/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001098555/article/raiders-officially-announce-las-vegas-raiders-title|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"LVRaiders\">{{cite news|author=Raiders Media Relations|title=Las Vegas Raiders - Silver and Black officially welcomed to the Silver State|url=https://www.raiders.com/news/las-vegas-raiders-silver-and-black-officially-welcomed-to-the-silver-state|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Raiders.com|date=January 22, 2020|access-date=January 23, 2020|archive-date=January 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200123045401/https://www.raiders.com/news/las-vegas-raiders-silver-and-black-officially-welcomed-to-the-silver-state|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Raiders' on-field fortunes have varied considerably over the years. The team's first three years of operation ([[1960 Oakland Raiders season|1960]]\u2013[[1962 Oakland Raiders season|1962]]) were marred by poor performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|1963]], the Raiders' fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) [[Al Davis]]. In [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967]], after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship]] that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to [[Super Bowl II]], where they were soundly defeated by the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Since 1963, the team has won 15 division titles (3 AFL and 12 NFL), 4 AFC Championships ([[1976\u201377 NFL playoffs|1976]], [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs|1980]], [[1983\u201384 NFL playoffs|1983]], and [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs|2002]]), one AFL Championship ([[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967]]), and three Super Bowl Championships: [[Super Bowl XI|XI (1976)]], [[Super Bowl XV|XV (1980)]], and [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII (1983)]]. As of the end of the NFL's [[2022 NFL season|2022 season]], the Raiders have an all-time regular season record of 497 wins, 458 losses, and 11 ties; their all-time playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 20 losses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/|title=Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders Team Encyclopedia {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-date=July 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707115845/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Davis owned the team from 1972 until his death in 2011. Control of the franchise was then given to Al's son [[Mark Davis (American football)|Mark Davis]], with Al's wife [[Carol Davis (American football)|Carol]] maintaining ownership. The Raiders are known for their [[Raider Nation|extensive fan base]] and distinctive team culture. The Raiders have had 17 former players who have been enshrined in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] as well as two former coaches and Al Davis. They have previously played at [[Kezar Stadium]] and [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco, [[Frank Youell Field]] and [[Oakland Coliseum]] in Oakland, and the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{See also|History of the Las Vegas Raiders|Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders}}\n{{NFL Raiders history}}\n=== First Oakland era (1960\u20131981) ===\n<!-- NOTE DO NOT ADDED AL DAVIS IMAGES BECAUSE VIOLATIONS -->\nThe Oakland Raiders were originally going to be called the \"Oakland Se\u00f1ors\"<ref>\"Grid Team Named-- They're Senors\", ''Oakland Tribune'', April 5, 1960, p37. Soda said, \"My own personal choice would have been Mavericks, but I believe we came up with a real fine name.\" The selection committee narrowed the choices down to Admirals, Lakers, Diablos, Seawolves, Gauchos, Nuggets, Se\u00f1ors, Dons, Costers, Grandees, Sequoias, Missiles, Knights, Redwoods, Clippers, Jets and Dolphins.</ref> after a name-the-team contest had that name finish first, but after being the target of local jokes, the name was changed to the Raiders before the 1960 season began. Having enjoyed a successful collegiate coaching career at [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] during the 1950s, San Francisco native [[Eddie Erdelatz]] was hired as the Raiders' first head coach. On February 9, 1960, after rejecting offers from the NFL's [[Washington Commanders|Washington Redskins]] and the AFL's [[Los Angeles Chargers]], Erdelatz accepted the Raiders' head coaching position. In January 1960, the Raiders were established in Oakland, and, because of NFL interference with the original eighth franchise owner, were the last team of eight in the new [[American Football League]] to select players, thus relegated to the remaining talent available (see below).\n\nThe [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|1960 Raiders]] 42-man roster included 28 rookies and only 14 veterans. Among the Raiders rookies were future Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee center [[Jim Otto]] and future Raiders head coach, quarterback [[Tom Flores]]. In their debut year under Erdelatz, the [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finished with a 6\u20138 record.\n\nOn September 18, 1961, Erdelatz was dismissed after the Raiders were outscored 77\u201346 in the first two games of the season. On September 24, 1961, after the dismissal of Erdelatz, management named Los Angeles native and offensive line coach [[Marty Feldman (American football coach)|Marty Feldman]] as the Raiders head coach. The team finished the 1961 season with a 2\u201312 record.\n\nFeldman began the [[1962 Oakland Raiders season|1962 season]] as Raiders head coach but was fired on October 16, 1962, after an 0\u20135 start. From October 16 through December, the Raiders were coached by Oklahoma native and former assistant coach [[Red Conkright]]. Under Conkright, the Raiders went 1\u20138, finishing the season with 1\u201313 record. Following the 1962 season the Raiders appointed Conkright to an interim mentor position as they looked for a new head coach.\n\nAfter the 1962 season, Raiders managing general partner [[F. Wayne Valley]] hired Al Davis as Raiders head coach and general manager. At 33, he was the youngest person in professional football history to hold the positions.<ref name=\"youngest\">{{cite web |url=http://www.raiders.com/history/gm11.jsp |title=Raiders Stun Chargers with 33-Point 4th Quarter Outburst |access-date=February 4, 2007 |work=Raiders.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230172729/http://www.raiders.com/history/gm11.jsp |archive-date=December 30, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Davis immediately began to implement what he termed the \"vertical game\", an aggressive offensive strategy inspired by the offense developed by Chargers head coach [[Sid Gillman]].<ref name=\"gillman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chargers.com/news/headlines/news-104158080019831.htm |title=Memories of Sid Gillman |access-date=February 1, 2007 |work=Chargers.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090813/http://www.chargers.com/news/headlines/news-104158080019831.htm |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Under Davis the [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] improved to 10\u20134 and he was named the AFL's Coach of the Year in 1963. Though the team slipped to 5\u20137\u20132 in [[1964 Oakland Raiders season|1964]], they rebounded to an 8\u20135\u20131 record in [[1965 Oakland Raiders season|1965]]. The famous silver and black Raider uniform debuted at the regular season-opening game on September 7, 1963. Prior to this, the team wore a combination of black and white with gold trim on the pants and oversized numerals.\n\nIn April 1966 Davis left the Raiders after being named AFL Commissioner, promoting assistant coach [[John Rauch]] to head coach. Two months later, the league announced its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger with the NFL]].\n\nThe leagues would retain separate regular seasons until [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. With the merger, the position of commissioner was no longer needed, and Al Davis entered into discussions with Valley about returning to the Raiders. On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part-owner of the team. He purchased a 10% interest in the team for $18,000 ({{Inflation|US|18000|1966|fmt=eq}}), and became the team's third general partner. He also became head of football operations.<ref name=\"burke\">{{cite magazine |last=Burke |first=Monte |title=A New Test For an Old Raider |magazine=Forbes Magazine |date=September 18, 2006 |url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2006/0918/112.html |access-date=January 25, 2007 |archive-date=October 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018050103/http://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2006/0918/112.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Dickey, Just Win, Baby, p. 41\">Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', p. 41.</ref>\n\nUnder Rauch, the Raiders matched their 1965 season's 8\u20135\u20131 record in [[1966 Oakland Raiders season|1966]] but missed the playoffs, finishing second in the AFL West Division.\n\n==== AFL champions (1967) ====\nOn the field, the team Davis had assembled steadily improved. Led by quarterback [[Daryle Lamonica]], acquired in a trade with the [[Buffalo Bills]], the Raiders finished the [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967 season]] with a 13\u20131 record and won the [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967 AFL Championship]], defeating the [[1967 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] 40\u20137. The win earned the team a trip to the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] in Miami, Florida to participate in [[Super Bowl II]]. On January 14, 1968, the Raiders were defeated in the second-ever Super Bowl, losing 33\u201314 to [[Vince Lombardi]]'s [[1967 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].\n\nThe following year, the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] ended the [[1968 AFL season|1968 season]] with a 12\u20132 record and again winning the AFL West Division title. They lost 27\u201323 to the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in the [[1968 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship Game]].\n\nCiting management conflicts with day-to-day coaching decisions, Rauch resigned as Raiders head coach on January 16, 1969, accepting the head coaching job of the Buffalo Bills.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, [[John Madden]] was a defensive assistant coach at [[San Diego State University]] under SDSU head coach [[Don Coryell]]. Madden credited Coryell as being an influence on his coaching. In 1967, Madden was hired by Al Davis as the Raiders linebacker coach. On February 4, 1969, after the departure of John Rauch, Madden was named the Raiders sixth head coach. Under Madden, the [[1969 Oakland Raiders season|1969 Raiders]] won the AFL West Division title for the third consecutive year with a 12\u20131\u20131 record. On December 20, 1969, the Raiders defeated the [[1969 Houston Oilers season|Oilers]] 56\u20137 in the AFL Division playoff game. In the [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship game]] on January 4, 1970, the Raiders were defeated by [[Hank Stram]]'s [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 17\u20137.\n\nIn 1970, the AFL\u2013NFL merger was completed after four years and the Raiders joined the Western Division of the [[American Football Conference]] (actually the AFL West with the same teams as in 1969, except for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]) in the newly merged NFL. The first [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|post-merger season]] saw the Raiders win the AFC West with an 8\u20134\u20132 record and advance to the [[1970 AFC Championship Game|conference championship]], where they lost to the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]]. Despite another 8\u20134\u20132 season in [[1971 NFL season|1971]], it was only good for second place in the AFC West, and the team failed to make the playoffs. When backup offensive lineman [[Ron Mix]] played, the 1971 Raiders had an eventual all-Pro Football Hall of Fame offensive line with tackle [[Art Shell]], guard [[Gene Upshaw]], center Jim Otto, and tackle [[Bob Brown (offensive lineman)|Bob Brown]].\n\n[[File:John Madden in 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[John Madden]] was the head coach of the Raiders for 10 seasons. Madden's overall winning percentage including playoff games ranks second in league history. He won a Super Bowl and never had a losing season as a head coach.]]\nThe teams of the 1970s were thoroughly dominant teams, with eight Hall of Fame inductees on the roster and a Hall of Fame coach in John Madden. The 1970s Raiders created the team's identity and persona as a team that was hard-hitting. Dominant on defense, with the crushing hits of safeties [[Jack Tatum]] and [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] and cornerback [[Skip Thomas]], the Raiders regularly held first place in the AFC West, entering the playoffs nearly every season. From 1973 through 1977, the Raiders reached the conference championship every year.\n\nThis was also the era of a bitter rivalry between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and Raiders. In the 1970s, the Steelers and Raiders were frequently the two best teams in the AFC and, arguably, the NFL. The teams would meet on five occasions in the playoffs, and the winner of the Steelers-Raiders game went on to win the Super Bowl in three of those instances, from 1974 to 1976. The rivalry garnered attention in the sports media, with controversial plays, late hits, accusations and public statements.\n\nThe rivalry began with and was fueled by a controversial last-second play in their first playoff game in [[1972 NFL season|1972]]. That season the [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] achieved a 10\u20133\u20131 record and an AFC West title. In the divisional round, the Raiders would lose to the [[1972 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] 13\u20137 on the controversial play that has become known as the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\".\n\nThe [[1973 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] and [[1973 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] would meet again the [[1973 NFL season|following season]] as the Raiders won the AFC West again with a 9\u20134\u20131 record. Lamonica was replaced as starting quarterback early in the season by [[Ken Stabler]]. The Raiders defeated Pittsburgh 33\u201314 in the divisional round of the playoffs to reach the AFC Championship, but lost 27\u201310 to the [[1973 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].\n\nIn [[1974 NFL season|1974]] [[1974 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] had a 12\u20132 regular season, which included a nine-game winning streak. They beat the [[1974 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] 28\u201326 in the divisional round of the playoffs in a see-saw battle remembered as the \"Sea of Hands\" game.<ref>National Football League lore</ref> They then lost the AFC Championship to the [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]], who went on to win the Super Bowl. The Raiders were held to only 29 yards rushing by the Pittsburgh defense, and late mistakes turned a 10\u20133 lead at the start of the fourth quarter into a disappointing 24\u201313 loss.\n\nIn the [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]] opener, the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] beat [[1975 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] and ended their 31-game home winning streak. With an 11\u20133 record, they defeated [[1975 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]] 31\u201328 in the divisional playoff round. Again, the Raiders faced the [[1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] in the conference championship, eager for revenge. According to Madden and Davis, the Raiders relied on quick movement by their wide receivers on the outside sidelines \u2013 the deep threat, or 'long ball' \u2013 more so than the Steelers of that year, whose offense was far more run-oriented than it would become later in the 1970s. Forced to adapt to the frozen field of Three Rivers Stadium, with receivers slipping and unable to make quick moves to beat coverage, the Raiders lost, 16\u201310. The rivalry had now grown to hatred, and became the stereotype of the 'grudge match.' Again, the Raiders came up short, as the Steelers won the AFC Championship and then went on to another Super Bowl title.\n\n==== Super Bowl XI champions (1976) ====\nIn [[1976 NFL season|1976]], the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] came from behind dramatically to beat [[1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] 31\u201328 in the season opener and continued to cement its reputation for dirty play by knocking WR [[Lynn Swann]] out for two weeks with a clothesline to the helmet. Al Davis later tried to sue Steelers coach [[Chuck Noll]] for libel after the latter called safety [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] a criminal for the hit. The Raiders won 13 regular-season games and a close controversial 21\u201317 victory over [[1976 New England Patriots season|New England]] in the divisional playoffs. With the Patriots up by three points in the final two minutes, referee Ben Dreith called roughing the passer on New England's [[Ray Hamilton|Ray \"Sugar Bear\" Hamilton]] after he hit Oakland QB Ken Stabler. The Raiders went on to score a touchdown in the final minute to win. They then defeated the Steelers 24\u20137 in the AFC Championship to advance to their second Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XI]], Oakland's opponent was the [[1976 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], a team that had lost three previous Super Bowls. The Raiders jumped out to an early lead and led 16\u20130 at halftime. By the end, having forced Minnesota into multiple turnovers, the Raiders won 32\u201314 for their first Super Bowl and post-merger championship.\n\nThe [[1977 NFL season|following season]] saw the [[1977 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finish 11\u20133, but they lost the division title to the [[1977 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]. They settled for a wild card, beating the [[1977 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] in the second-longest overtime game in NFL history and which featured the [[Ghost to the Post]]. The Raiders then fell to the Broncos in the AFC Championship.\n\nDuring a 1978 preseason game, Patriots WR [[Darryl Stingley]] was injured by a hit from Raiders FS Jack Tatum and paralyzed for life. Although the [[1978 Oakland Raiders season|1978 Raiders]] achieved a winning record at 9\u20137, they missed the playoffs for the first time since 1971, losing critical games down the stretch to miss the playoffs.\n\nAfter 10 consecutive winning seasons and one Super Bowl championship, John Madden left coaching in 1979 to pursue a career as a television football commentator. His replacement was former Raiders quarterback [[Tom Flores]], the first Hispanic head coach in NFL history.<ref name=\"hispanic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/insider/2001/raidersnewhouse_091801.html |title=1980 Raiders were outcasts, champions |access-date=January 25, 2007 |last=Newhouse |first=Dave |website=[[NFL.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123200328/http://www.nfl.com/insider/2001/raidersnewhouse_091801.html |archive-date=January 23, 2007}}</ref> Flores led the [[1979 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to another 9\u20137 [[1979 NFL season|season]], but the team missed the playoffs.\n\n==== Super Bowl XV champions (1980) ====\nIn the midst of the turmoil of Al Davis' attempts to move the team to Los Angeles in [[1980 NFL season|1980]], Flores looked to lead the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to their third Super Bowl by finishing the season 11\u20135 and earning a wild card berth. Quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]] revitalized his career, taking over in game five when starter [[Dan Pastorini]] was lost for the season to a broken leg after owner Al Davis had picked up Pastorini when he swapped quarterbacks with the [[1980 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]], sending the beloved [[Ken Stabler]] to the Oilers. The Raiders defeated Stabler and the Oilers in the Wild Card game and advanced to the AFC Championship by defeating the [[1980 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] 14\u201312. The Raiders slipped by the AFC West champion San Diego Chargers to advance to their third Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XV]], the Raiders faced head coach [[Dick Vermeil]]'s [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The Raiders dominated the Eagles, taking an early 14\u20130 lead in the first quarter behind two touchdown passes by Plunkett, including a then-Super Bowl record 80-yard pass and catch to running back [[Kenny King (running back)|Kenny King]]. A [[Cliff Branch]] third-quarter touchdown reception put the Raiders up 21\u20133 in the third quarter. They would go on to win 27\u201310, winning their second Super Bowl and becoming the first team to ever win the Super Bowl after getting into the playoffs as the wild card team.\n\nThe Raiders' final campaign of their first run in Oakland of [[1981 Oakland Raiders season|1981]] saw the team fall to a 7\u20139 record, failing to make the playoffs following their Super Bowl win.\n\n=== Los Angeles Raiders (1982\u20131994) ===\n[[File:Howie Long - American Football Player TV host.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Raiders Hall of Famer [[Howie Long]]]]\nIn 1980 Al Davis attempted unsuccessfully to have improvements made to the [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]], specifically the addition of [[luxury box]]es. That year, he signed a [[memorandum of agreement]] to move the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. The move, which required three-fourths approval by league owners, was defeated 22\u20130 (with five owners abstaining). When Davis tried to move the team anyway, he was blocked by an [[injunction]]. In response, the Raiders not only became an active partner in an [[Competition law|antitrust]] lawsuit filed by the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] (who had recently lost the [[Los Angeles Rams]] to [[Angel Stadium|Anaheim]]), but filed an antitrust lawsuit of their own.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 168.</ref> After the first case was declared a [[Trial|mistrial]], in May 1982, a second jury found in favor of Davis and the Los Angeles Coliseum, clearing the way for the move.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 172.</ref><ref name=\"moveone\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/davisall.shtml |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223180421/http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/davisall.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 23, 2002 |title=Al Davis biography |access-date=January 30, 2007 |work=HickokSports.com }}</ref><ref name=\"movetwo\">{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_davis_al.html |title=Good guys wear black |access-date=January 30, 2007 |last=Puma |first=Mike |date=December 1, 2003 |publisher=[[ESPN Classic]] |archive-date=March 10, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310021658/http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_davis_al.html |url-status=live }}</ref> With the ruling, the Raiders would relocate to Los Angeles for the [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] to play their home games at the Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThe newly minted [[1982 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] finished the [[1982 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] 8\u20131 to win the AFC West, but lost in the second round of the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] to the [[1982 New York Jets season|Jets]].\n\n==== Super Bowl XVIII champions (1983) ====\nThe [[1983 NFL season|following season]], the [[1983 Los Angeles Raiders season|Raiders]] finished 12\u20134 to win the AFC West. Convincing playoff wins over the [[1983 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] and [[1983 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in the [[1983\u201384 NFL playoffs|AFC playoffs]] propelled the Raiders to their fourth Super Bowl. Against the [[1983 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in [[Super Bowl XVIII]], the Raiders built a lead after blocking a punt and recovering for a touchdown early in the game. A Branch touchdown reception from Plunkett put the Raiders up 14\u20130 with more than nine minutes remaining in the first quarter. With seven seconds remaining in the first half, linebacker [[Jack Squirek]] intercepted a [[Joe Theismann]] [[swing pass]] at the Washington five-yard line and scored, sending the Raiders to a 21\u20133 halftime lead. Following a [[John Riggins]] one-yard touchdown run (extra point was blocked), [[Marcus Allen]] scored from five yards out to build the lead to 28\u20139. The Raiders sealed the game with Allen reversed his route on a Super Bowl record run that turned into a 74-yard touchdown. The Raiders went on to a 38\u20139 victory and their third NFL championship. Allen set a record for most rushing yards (191) and combined yards (209) in a Super Bowl as the Raiders won their third Super Bowl in eight years.\n\n[[File:1985 Police Raiders-Rams - 01 Marcus Allen (crop).jpg|thumb|230px|Raiders' Hall of Famer [[Marcus Allen]] is considered one of the greatest goal line and short-yard runners in National Football League history.]]\nThe [[1984 Los Angeles Raiders season|team]] had another successful regular season in [[1984 NFL season|1984]], finishing 11\u20135, but a three-game losing streak forced them to enter the playoffs as a wild-card, where they fell to the [[1984 Seattle Seahawks season|Seahawks]] in the Wild Card game.\n\nThe [[1985 Los Angeles Raiders season|1985 Raiders]] campaign saw 12 wins and a division title as Marcus Allen was named MVP. A loss to the [[1985 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] derailed any further postseason hopes.\n\nThe Raiders' fortunes declined after that, and from [[1986 Los Angeles Raiders season|1986]] to [[1989 Los Angeles Raiders season|1989]], they finished no better than 8\u20138 and posted consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 1961\u201362. Also in 1986, Al Davis got into a widely publicized argument with Marcus Allen, whom he accused of faking injuries. The feud continued into [[1987 Los Angeles Raiders season|1987]], and Davis retaliated by signing [[Bo Jackson]] to essentially replace Allen. Jackson was also a [[left fielder]] for [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Kansas City Royals]], and could not play full-time until baseball season ended in October. Even worse, another [[1987 NFL strike|strike]] cost the NFL one game and prompted them to use substitute players. The Raiders achieved a 1\u20132 record before the regular players returned after the strike. After a weak 5\u201310 finish, Tom Flores moved to the front office and was replaced by Denver Broncos offensive assistant coach [[Mike Shanahan]].\n\nShanahan led the team to a 7\u20139 season in [[1988 Los Angeles Raiders season|1988]], and Allen and Jackson continued to trade places as the starting running back. Low game attendance and fan apathy were evident by this point, and in the summer of 1988, rumors of a Raiders return to Oakland intensified when a preseason game against the [[1988 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] was scheduled at Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 234.</ref>\n\nAfter starting the [[1989 NFL season|1989 season]] with a 1\u20133 record, Shanahan was fired by Davis, which began a long-standing feud between the two.<ref name=\"feud\">{{cite news |first=John |last=Czarnecki |title=Raiders, Broncos renew rivalry |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/949168 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014708/http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/949168 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |work=Fox Sports |access-date=January 29, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://losangeles.sbnation.com/2011/10/10/2481973/raiders-al-davis-mike-shanahan-history|title=Raiders History: Al Davis And Mike Shanahan, Best Friends Forever|last=Kunnath|first=Avinash|date=October 10, 2011|website=SB Nation Los Angeles|access-date=May 31, 2017|archive-date=January 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108062656/https://losangeles.sbnation.com/2011/10/10/2481973/raiders-al-davis-mike-shanahan-history|url-status=live}}</ref> He was replaced by former Raider offensive lineman [[Art Shell]], who had been voted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] earlier in the year.

The team wore this design from 1960 to 1962. In a very rare move, the jerseys displayed the player's full name on the back, before being pared down to only the surname in 1963. When Al Davis became head coach and general manager in 1963, he changed the team's color scheme to silver and black, and added a logo to the helmet. This logo is a shield that consists of the word \"RAIDERS\" at the top, two crossed cutlasses with handles up and cutting edge down, and superimposed head of a Raider wearing a football helmet and a black eye patch covering his right eye. Over the years, it has undergone minor color modifications (such as changing the background from silver to black in 1964), but it has essentially remained the same.\n\nThe Raiders' current silver and black uniform design has essentially remained the same since it debuted in 1963.<ref>{{cite news|last=Paskal|first=Eddie|title=Raiders Recognized For Iconic Uniforms|url=https://www.raiders.com/news/raiders-recognized-for-iconic-uniforms-15312904|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Raiders.com|date=May 21, 2015|access-date=August 26, 2020|archive-date=October 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027142308/https://www.raiders.com/news/raiders-recognized-for-iconic-uniforms-15312904|url-status=live}}</ref> It consists of silver helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys.

Originally, the white jerseys had black letters for the names and silver numbers with a thick black outline, but they were changed to black with a silver outline for the 1964 season. In 1970, the team used silver numerals with black outline and black lettering names for the season. In 1971, the team again displayed black numerals and have stayed that way ever since (with the exception of the 1994 season as part of the NFL's 75th Anniversary where they donned the 1963 helmets with the 1970 silver away numbers and black lettering names).\n\nThe Raiders wore their white jerseys at home for the first time in their history on September 28, 2008, against the San Diego Chargers.

Valley threatened to move the Raiders out of the area unless a stadium was built in Oakland, so in 1962 the Raiders moved into 18,000-seat [[Frank Youell Field]] (later expanded to 22,000 seats), their first home in Oakland.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', p. 10.</ref> It was a temporary home for the team while the 53,000 seat [[Oakland Coliseum]] was under construction; the Coliseum was completed in 1966. The Raiders shared the Coliseum with the [[Oakland Athletics]] once the A's moved to Oakland from Kansas City in 1968, except for the years the Raiders called Los Angeles home (1982\u201394). The Raiders defeated and lost to all 31 other NFL teams at the Coliseum at least once.\n\nThe Raiders did play one regular-season game at [[California Memorial Stadium]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. On September 23, 1973, they played the [[Miami Dolphins]] in Berkeley due to a scheduling conflict with the Athletics. The team defeated the Dolphins 12\u20137, ending Miami's winning streak.\n\nDuring the Los Angeles years, the Raiders played in the 93,000-seat [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].\n\nFrom the assumption of the team by [[Mark Davis (American football)|Mark Davis]] in 2011, the Raiders had been subject to rampant relocation speculation as the team attempted to find a new stadium in Oakland or elsewhere, due to the age of [[Oakland Alameda Coliseum]], being secondary tenants to [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Oakland Athletics|Athletics]], and the expiration of the team's lease at the end of 2013.

Both the Raiders and the [[San Francisco 49ers]] shared the San Francisco Bay Area market, on the West Coast of the United States.

In addition, they could not play interconference home games at the same time or network as the 49ers.

Oakland lost the [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|1969 AFL Championship]] against Kansas City, who went on to beat the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and win the Super Bowl. From 1990 to 1999, the Raiders lost 17 out of 20 regular-season meetings between the Chiefs, including a 10\u2013game losing streak at Kansas City; the Raiders also lost to the Chiefs 10\u20136 in the Wild Card round on December 28, 1991. On September 8, 1996, the Chiefs also began to lead the overall series against the Raiders for the first time since November 23, 1969. On January 1, 2000, the last game of the 1999 NFL regular season, the Raiders defeated the Chiefs for the first time in Kansas City since 1988 in overtime on a 33-yard field goal kick made by Joe Nedney. Until October 19, 2017 \u2013 when they defeated the Chiefs, 31\u201330 on a game-tying touchdown on the last play of the game, leading to a game-winning PAT \u2013 the Raiders had lost five straight to the Chiefs, their previous win against them being in the 2014 season. However, the Raiders would defeat the Chiefs 40\u201332 in the 2020, snapping a five-game losing streak and also winning in Kansas City for the first time since 2012. On Christmas Day 2023, the Raiders defeated the Chiefs and snapped another five-game losing streak.\n\nThe Chiefs lead the overall series '''71\u201354\u20132''', and are the only team in the AFC West against whom the Raiders have a losing record.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=Las Vegas Raiders Head-to-Head Records |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/head-to-head.htm |access-date=2024-01-23 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Denver Broncos ====\n{{Main|Broncos\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe Raiders' rivalry with the [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]] is considered to be one of the most heated and well-known rivalries in NFL history. The Raiders managed a 14-game winning streak against the Broncos from 1965 to 1971, which lasted until October 22, 1972, when the Broncos defeated the Raiders 30\u201323. The Broncos amassed 21 wins in 28 games, from the 1995 season and the arrival of Broncos head coach [[Mike Shanahan]], through the 2008 season. Shanahan coached the Raiders before being fired just four games into the 1989 season, which served to intensify this rivalry. On December 13, 2015, the Raiders pulled a huge upset on the Broncos (15\u201312) by a spectacular performance from their defense allowing only four field goals. Linebacker Khalil Mack recorded five sacks in that game  which is tied for the most sacks in a game with Howie Long. The Broncos reached their first-ever Super Bowl when they defeated the Raiders 20\u201317 in the AFC Championship Game. The two teams have faced off on Monday Night Football a total of 19 times, making it the most frequent Monday Night matchup in NFL history.\n\nRaiders hold the advantage in the all-time series '''72\u201353\u20132.'''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Los Angeles Chargers ====\n{{Main|Chargers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[Los Angeles Chargers]]' rivalry with Oakland dates to the 1963 season, when the Raiders defeated the heavily favored Chargers twice, both come-from-behind fourth-quarter victories. The Raiders held a streak without losing to the Chargers with a 16\u20130\u20132 record from 1968 to 1977. One of the most memorable games between these teams was the \"Holy Roller\" game in 1978, in which the Raiders fumbled for a touchdown in a very controversial play. In January 1981 the Chargers hosted their first AFC title against the Raiders. The Raiders were victorious over the Chargers of a score 34\u201327. The Raiders ended up moving on to play in Super Bowl 15 defeating the Eagles 27\u201310. On November 22, 1982, the Raiders hosted their first Monday Night football game in Los Angeles against the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers led the game in the 1st half 24\u20130 until the Raiders came into the 2nd half and made a huge comeback and defeated the San Diego Chargers 28\u201324. On October 10, 2010, the Raiders ended their 13-game losing streak to the San Diego Chargers with a score of 35\u201327. The Raiders hold the overall series advantage at '''67\u201357\u20132'''.\n\n===Conference===\n====Pittsburgh Steelers====\n{{main|Raiders\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\nThe [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]' rivalry with the Raiders has historically been very tight; as of the 2018 season the Raiders lead the regular-season series 13 wins to 10, and their playoff rivalry is tied 3\u20133. The rivalry was extremely intense during the 1970s, and considered by many to be one of the most vicious and brutal in the history of Professional football. From 1972 to 1976 the teams would meet in the playoffs five consecutive times, including three consecutive AFC Championship games. The rivalry really kicked off during the teams' first playoff meeting at the 1972 AFC divisional round in Pittsburgh. Considered to be one of the most famous plays in NFL history, the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\", as it was dubbed, saw the Steelers beat the Raiders on a controversial last-second play. During the 1975 AFC Championship game, Raiders strong safety [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] delivered a hit on Pittsburgh wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]], which left him concussed. When the two teams met in the 1976 season opener, Atkinson again hit Swann, this time with a forearm to the head, causing yet another concussion. After the second incident, Steelers head coach [[Chuck Noll]] referred to Atkinson as part of the \"criminal element\" in the NFL. Atkinson filed a $2&nbsp;million [[defamation]] lawsuit against Noll and the Steelers, which he lost.<ref name=\"atkinson\">{{cite news|first=Bob |last=Smizik |title=Raiders of the lost rivalry |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06302/733903-194.stm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108175110/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06302/733903-194.stm |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 8, 2006 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=October 29, 2006 |access-date=January 31, 2007}}</ref> The rivalry reached its apex in the late 1980s, cooled when the teams faced each other only sporadically, then headed up again in the late 1990s before cooling again. The four most recent contests between the Raiders and Steelers harkened back to the rivalry's history of bitterness and close competition. On December 6, 2009, the 3\u20138 Raiders helped spoil the [[Super Bowl XLIII|defending champions]]' quest for the playoffs as the game lead changed five times in the fourth quarter and a [[Louis Murphy]] touchdown with 11 seconds to go won it 27\u201324 for the Raiders. Oakland was then beaten 35\u20133 by Pittsburgh on November 21, 2010; this game brought out the roughness of the rivalry's 1970s history when Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was punched by Raiders defensive end [[Richard Seymour]] following a touchdown. On November 8, 2015, the Steelers outplayed the Raiders for a 38\u201335 victory. During the game, the Raiders defense allowed wide receiver [[Antonio Brown]] to catch 17 passes for 284 yards. Both are Steelers team records and the 284 yards is the 7th most yards receiving in a game in NFL history. In 2018, the Raiders upset the Steelers again, scoring a late touchdown to take a 24\u201321 fourth-quarter lead and getting the last laugh when Steelers kicker [[Chris Boswell]] slipped and missed a game-tying field goal. This game, which was the teams' final matchup in Oakland, contributed to the Steelers' late-season collapse and missing the playoffs that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ |title=Raiders Block FG To Finish Dramatic Upset of Steelers, 24-21 |publisher=CBS San Francisco |work=The Associated Press |date=9 December 2018 |access-date=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531012748/https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe rivalry between the Raiders and [[New England Patriots]] dates to their time in the AFL, but was intensified during a 1978 preseason game, when Patriots wide receiver [[Darryl Stingley]] was permanently paralyzed after a vicious hit delivered by Raiders free safety [[Jack Tatum]]. Before that, New England also lost a playoff game in 1976 to the Raiders; the game is unofficially known as \"The [[Ben Dreith]] Game\" due to a controversial penalty by head referee Dreith. While based in Los Angeles, the team hosted New England in the divisional round of the playoffs in 1986. The game was won by New England and marred by a chaotic rumble between the teams in the end zone as players were leaving the field after the game. The brawl was especially notable for [[Matt Millen]] attacking Patriots GM [[Patrick Sullivan (American football executive)|Patrick Sullivan]] with his helmet. The two teams met in a [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|divisional-round]] playoff game in 2002, which became known as the \"[[Tuck Rule Game]]\". Late in the game, an incomplete pass, ruled a fumble, by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was overturned, and New England went on to win in overtime and eventually won the Super Bowl against the heavily favored [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], the Raiders' former crosstown rivals in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"pats\">{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Halley |title=Patriots-Raiders: No love lost over time |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-09-08-pats-raiders-history_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=September 8, 2005 |access-date=January 31, 2007 |archive-date=September 12, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912021606/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-09-08-pats-raiders-history_x.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Since that game, the Patriots have won five of the last six regular-season contests between the two teams.

The Raiders would not beat New England again until 2022, after they relocated to Las Vegas, with a [[Lunatic Lateral|failed lateral pass play by New England at the end of regulation]] resulting in a walk-off touchdown and a 30\u201324 win for the Raiders. The teams met again in the following season with the Raiders winning 21\u201317.\n\n===Historic===\n====Miami Dolphins====\n{{main|Dolphins\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe Raiders faced the [[Miami Dolphins]] thrice in the early 1970s. The Raiders defeated the Dolphins 21\u201314 in the 1970 divisional round, then the Dolphins exacted revenge in the 1973 AFC Championship Game by winning 27\u201310 on their way to [[Super Bowl VIII]]. The next year in the divisional playoffs the Raiders trailed Miami 26\u201321; in the final minute the Raiders drove to the Miami eight-yard line; a desperation pass by [[Ken Stabler]] was caught in traffic by [[Clarence Davis]] in the play known as the \"Sea of Hands\".\n\n====New York Jets====\nThe [[New York Jets]] began a strong rivalry with the Raiders in the AFL during the 1960s that continued through much of the 1970s, fueled in part by Raider [[Ike Lassiter]] breaking star quarterback [[Joe Namath]]'s jaw during a 1967 game (though [[Ben Davidson]] was wrongly blamed),<ref name=\"lassiter\">{{cite news |first=Tom |last=LaMarre |title=Jets-Raiders series boasts several classics |url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/OAK/4774152 |work=NFL.com |date=December 31, 2001 |access-date=January 31, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505154309/http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/OAK/4774152 |archive-date=May 5, 2007}}</ref> the famous [[Heidi Game]] during the 1968 season, and the Raiders' bitter loss to the Jets in the AFL Championship later that season.

On August 20, 2011, in the third week of the preseason, the preseason game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at [[Candlestick Park]], including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL has decided to cancel all future preseason games between the Raiders and 49ers. The series ended on November 1, 2018, during a Thursday Night Football broadcast at Levi's Stadium, marking the last time both teams would meet before the Raiders moved to their new home in Las Vegas. The 49ers won the game 34\u20133 to tie their regular-season series at 7.\n\n====Battle of Los Angeles====\n{{Main|Battle of Los Angeles (NFL)}}\nInitially considered the \"Battle of Los Angeles\" during the Raiders' tenure in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994, the Raiders shared the market with the [[Los Angeles Rams]] during this period, sparking a fight for LA's dominant fans until both teams relocated due to declining attendance and mutual stadium issues following the 1994 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.raiders.com/photos/raiders-rams-rivalry-in-pictures-14451390#c33e4f80-2b63-4330-84d1-d7dc85920c8e|title=Raiders-Rams Rivalry over the Years}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Futrell |first=Ron |date=August 20, 2021 |title=Raiders and Rams ready to renew old Southern California rivalry |url=https://www.kron4.com/nfl/raiders/raiders-and-rams-ready-to-renew-old-southern-california-rivalry/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210822165418/https://www.kron4.com/nfl/raiders/raiders-and-rams-ready-to-renew-old-southern-california-rivalry/ |archive-date=August 22, 2021 |access-date=October 1, 2021 |website=[[KRON-TV]]}}</ref> The rivalry became nonexistent as the Rams had also moved to St. Louis the same year. The Raiders unsuccessfully attempted to move back to Los Angeles in 2015 after a failed joint stadium project with the then-San Diego Chargers.\n\n==Ownership, administration and financial operations==\n\n===Founding of the franchise===\nMax Winter, a Minneapolis businessman was among the eight proposed franchise owners in the American Football League. In a move typical of the NFL owners who were frightened by the prospect of competition and continually obstructed the new league, they offered Winter an expansion franchise in the NFL. This was after the NFL had rejected Lamar Hunt's feelers, saying they were not interested in expansion. One of many obfuscations put forward by the NFL in its attempt to derail the AFL.\n\nAfter the AFL's first draft, in which players were selected for the then nameless Minneapolis franchise, Winter reneged from his agreement with the AFL owners and defected to the NFL with a franchise that started play in 1961 and was named the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The Vikings were never an AFL team, nor did they have any association with the AFL. Many of the players (including Abner Haynes) that had been assigned to the UNNAMED and defunct Minneapolis AFL franchise were signed by some of the seven loyal remaining members of the AFL's '[[Foolish Club]]'.\n\nThe city of Oakland was awarded the eighth AFL franchise on January 30, 1960. Once the consortium of owners was found for the eighth franchise, the team was named the Raiders.<ref name=\"hof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=23 |title=Pro Football Hall of Fame \u2013 Oakland Raiders |access-date=January 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230070530/http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=23 |archive-date=December 30, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', p. 7.</ref> Because many of the defunct Minneapolis franchise's originally drafted players were signed by other AFL teams, the AFL held an 'allocation' draft, in which each team earmarked players that could be chosen by the Raiders.\n\nThe Minneapolis group did not take with them any of the rights to players they drafted when they defected to the NFL, because their first draft in that league was in 1961. The Raiders were not originally in Minnesota as some claim. They were a new, charter franchise in the [[American Football League]]. One reason they were so weak in the first few years of the AFL was that the other AFL teams did not make quality players available in the allocation draft.\n\nAt the time, Oakland seemed an unlikely venue for a professional football team. The city had not asked for a team, there was no ownership group and there was no stadium in Oakland suitable for pro football (the closest stadiums were in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and San Francisco) and there was already a successful NFL franchise in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] in the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The AFL owners selected Oakland after [[Los Angeles Chargers]] owner [[Barron Hilton]] threatened to forfeit his franchise unless a second team was placed on the West Coast.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nUpon receiving the franchise, Oakland civic leaders found a number of businesspeople willing to invest in the new team. A [[limited partnership]] was formed to own the team headed by managing general partner [[Chet Soda|Y. Charles (Chet) Soda]] (1908\u20131989), a local real estate developer, and included general partners Ed McGah (1899\u20131983), Robert Osborne (1898\u20131968), [[F. Wayne Valley]] (1914\u20131986), restaurateur Harvey Binns (1914\u20131982), Don Blessing (1904\u20132000), and contractor Charles Harney (1902\u20131962)<ref>Harney was the builder of San Francisco's Candlestick Park, built on a bleak parcel of land he owned; to date, the road leading to the stadium is known as Harney Way. With a push from Harney, the Raiders were allowed to play their final three 1960 home games at Candlestick.</ref> as well as numerous limited partners.\n\nThe [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finished their first campaign with a 6\u20138 record, and lost $500,000. Desperately in need of money to continue running the team, Valley received a $400,000 loan from [[Buffalo Bills]] founder [[Ralph C. Wilson Jr.]]<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video |people=[[Steve Sabol]] (Executive Producer) |date=2004 |title=Raiders \u2013 The Complete History |medium=DVD |publisher=NFL Productions LLC}}</ref>\n\nAfter the conclusion of the first season Soda dropped out of the partnership, and on January 17, 1961, Valley, McGah and Osborne bought out the remaining four general partners. Soon after, Valley and McGah purchased Osborne's interest, with Valley named as the managing general partner.\n\nIn 1962 Valley hired Al Davis, a former assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers, as head coach and general manager. In April 1966 Davis left the Raiders after being named AFL Commissioner. Two months later, the league announced its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger with the NFL]]. With the merger, the position of commissioner was no longer needed, and Davis entered into discussions with Valley about returning to the Raiders. On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part owner of the team. He purchased a 10% interest in the team for US$18,000, and became the team's third general partner. As part of the deal, Davis was also given control over football operations.<ref name=\"burke\"/><ref name=\"Dickey, Just Win, Baby, p. 41\"/>\n\nIn 1972, with Wayne Valley out of the country for several weeks attending the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in Munich, Davis's attorneys drafted a revised partnership agreement that made him the new managing general partner, with complete control over all of the Raiders' operations. McGah, a supporter of Davis, signed the agreement. Under partnership law, by a 2\u20131 vote of the general partners, the new agreement was thus ratified. Valley was furious when he discovered this, and immediately filed suit to have the new agreement overturned, but the court sided with Davis and McGah.\n\nIn 1976 Valley sold his interest in the team. Although Davis only owned 25 percent of the team, no other partners have had any voice in team operations since.<ref name=\"burke\" /><ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', pp. 98\u2013101.</ref>\n\n====Current ownership structure====\nLegally, the club is owned by a nine-member limited partnership. A. D. Football, Inc., the company founded by Al Davis to hold his interest, is the general partner. The heirs of the original eight-member ownership group are limited partners.\n\nFrom 1972 onward, Davis had exercised total control of the Raiders as president of A.D. Football, Inc. Although exact ownership stakes are not known, it has been reported that Davis owned 47% of the team shares before his death in 2011. The limited partners have almost no role in team operations, though they were briefly mentioned in team media guides. Many of them had not watched, let alone attended, Raiders games in years at the time of Davis' death.<ref name=\"silence\">{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Zeigler |title=Silence of elders tells on Raiders |url=http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/oct/31/silence-elders-tells-raiders/?chargers |newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=October 31, 2009 |access-date=October 31, 2009 |archive-date=July 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728025939/https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-silence-elders-tells-raiders-2009oct31-story.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEd McGah, the last surviving member of the original ownership group, died in September 1983.

The younger McGah was himself a part-owner of the team, as a limited partner, and died in 2002. Several members of the McGah family filed suit against Davis in October 2003, alleging mismanagement of the team by Davis. The lawsuit sought monetary damages and to remove Davis and A. D. Football, Inc. as general partner. Among their specific complaints, the McGahs alleged that Davis failed to provide them with detailed financial information previously provided to Ed and E.J. McGah. The Raiders countered that\u2014under the terms of the partnership agreement as amended in 1972\u2014upon the death of the elder McGah in 1983, his general partner interest converted to that of a limited partner.

The PSLs, which ranged in cost from $250 to $4,000, were meant to help repay the $200&nbsp;million it cost the city of Oakland and Alameda County to expand the Oakland Coliseum. They were only valid for ten years, while other teams issue them permanently. As a result, fewer than 31,000 PSLs were sold for a stadium that holds twice that number.
