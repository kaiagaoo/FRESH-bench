At the top of the [[German football league system]], the Bundesliga is Germany's primary football competition. The Bundesliga comprises 18 teams and operates on a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the [[2. Bundesliga]]. Seasons run from August to May. Games are played on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. All of the Bundesliga [[football club (association football)|clubs]] take part in the [[DFB-Pokal]] cup competition. The winner of the Bundesliga qualifies for the [[DFL-Supercup]].\n\nFifty-seven clubs have competed in the Bundesliga since its founding. [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] has won 32 of 61 titles, as well as eleven consecutive seasons between 2013 and 2023, which is a record for a [[Big Five (association football)|Big Five league]]. The Bundesliga has also seen other champions, with [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[Hamburger SV]], [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]], [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]], and [[VfB Stuttgart]] most prominent among them. The Bundesliga is one of the top national leagues, ranked fourth in Europe according to [[UEFA]]'s [[UEFA coefficient#Men's Association coefficient|league coefficient]] ranking for the current 2023\u201324 season, based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons.<ref>{{Cite web |last=UEFA.com |title=Country coefficients {{!}} UEFA Coefficients |url=https://www.uefa.com/nationalassociations/uefarankings/country/ |access-date=2022-11-18 |website=UEFA.com |date=July 2018 |language=en |archive-date=2 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211102093931/https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Bundesliga led the UEFA ranking [[UEFA coefficient#Men's Association coefficient|from 1976 to 1984 and in 1990]]. It has also produced the [[UEFA coefficient#Top club by period|continent's top-rated club]] seven times. Bundesliga clubs have won eight [[UEFA Champions League]], seven [[UEFA Europa League]], four [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], two [[UEFA Super Cup]], two [[FIFA Club World Cup]], and three [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] titles.

The structure and organisation of the Bundesliga, along with Germany's other football leagues, have undergone frequent changes. The Bundesliga was founded by the [[German Football Association|Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Bund]] (English: German Football Association), but is now operated by the [[Deutsche Fu\u00dfball Liga]] (English: German Football League).\n\n==Structure==\nThe Bundesliga is composed of two divisions: the 1. Bundesliga (although it is rarely referred to with the ''First'' prefix), and, below that, the 2. Bundesliga (2nd Bundesliga), which has been the second tier of German football [[Introduction of the 2. Bundesliga|since 1974]]. The Bundesligen (plural) are professional leagues. Since 2008, the [[3. Liga]] (3rd League) in Germany has also been a professional league, but may not be called Bundesliga because the league is run by the German Football Association (DFB) and not, as are the two Bundesligen, by the [[Deutsche Fu\u00dfball Liga|German Football League]] (DFL).\n\nBelow the level of the 3. Liga, leagues are generally subdivided on a regional basis. For example, the Regionalligen are currently made up of Nord (North), Nordost (Northeast), S\u00fcd (South), S\u00fcdwest (Southwest) and West divisions. Below this are thirteen parallel divisions, most of which are called Oberligen (upper leagues) which represent federal states or large urban and geographical areas. The levels below the [[Oberliga (football)|Oberligen]] differ between the local areas. The league structure has changed frequently and typically reflects the degree of participation in the sport in various parts of the country. In the early 1990s, changes were driven by the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]] and the subsequent integration of the national league of East Germany.\n\nEvery team in the two Bundesligen must have a licence to play in the league, or else they are relegated into the regional leagues. To obtain a licence, teams must be financially healthy and meet certain standards of conduct as organisations.\n\nAs in other national leagues, there are significant benefits to being in the top division:\n*A greater share of television broadcast licence revenues goes to 1. Bundesliga sides.\n*1. Bundesliga teams draw significantly greater levels of fan support. Average attendance in the first league is 42,673 per game\u2014more than twice the average of the 2. Bundesliga.\n*Greater exposure through television and higher attendance levels helps 1. Bundesliga teams attract the most lucrative sponsorships.\n*1. Bundesliga teams develop substantial financial muscle through the combination of television and gate revenues, sponsorships and marketing of their team brands. This allows them to attract and retain skilled players from domestic and international sources and to construct first-class stadium facilities.\n\nThe 1. Bundesliga is financially strong, and the 2. Bundesliga has begun to evolve in a similar direction, becoming more stable organizationally and financially, and reflecting an increasingly higher standard of professional play.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\n[[File:Arena Auf Schalke hosting Schalke 04 vs Dortmund in 2009.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|right|[[Borussia Dortmund]] against rivals [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]], known as the [[Revierderby]], in the Bundesliga in 2009]]\nNo clubs have played continuously in the Bundesliga since its foundation; on 12 May 2018, Hamburger SV was the last founding club to be relegated for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Holtbys Siegtreffer kann den Abstieg nicht verhindern|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2017-18/34/3827891/spielbericht_hamburger-sv-12_borussia-mgladbach-15.html|website=kicker.de|publisher=kicker|access-date=13 May 2018|language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/soccer/ct-spt-hamburg-relegated-bundesliga-20180512-story.html |title=Hamburger SV relegated from Bundesliga for first time amid chaotic scenes |date=12 May 2018 |access-date=12 May 2018 |first=Ciaran |last=Fahey |agency=Associated Press |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, the Bundesliga reinstated an earlier German system of promotion and relegation, which had been in use from 1981 until 1991:\n* The bottom two finishers in the Bundesliga are automatically relegated to the 2. Bundesliga, with the top two finishers in the 2. Bundesliga taking their places.\n* The third-from-bottom club in the Bundesliga will play a two-legged tie with the third-place team from the 2. Bundesliga, with the winner taking up the final place in the following season's Bundesliga.\n\nFrom 1992 until 2008, a different system was used, in which the bottom three finishers of the Bundesliga were automatically relegated, to be replaced by the top three finishers in the 2. Bundesliga. From 1963 until 1981 two, or later three, teams were relegated from the Bundesliga automatically, while promotion was decided either completely or partially in [[Promotion to the Bundesliga|promotion play-offs]].\n\nThe season starts in early August<ref>German National Television</ref> and lasts until late May, with a winter break of six weeks (mid-December through to the end of January). Starting with the 2002-03 season, opening matches were introduced to feature defending champions on Friday nights on the first match day. Defending champions have not lost the opening matches since then, winning 16 of the 21 matches (up to the 2022-23 season). Starting with the 2021\u201322 season, kick off times were changed with Friday matches starting at 8:30&nbsp;pm, Saturdays at 3:30&nbsp;pm and 6:30&nbsp;pm, and Sundays at 3:30&nbsp;pm, 5:30&nbsp;pm and 7:30&nbsp;pm.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bundesliga kick-off times to change from the 2021/22 season|url=https://bulinews.com/news/4684/bundesliga-kick-off-times-change-from-the-2021-22-season|access-date=18 August 2021|website=Bulinews|date=3 March 2020 |language=en|archive-date=18 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210818072056/https://bulinews.com/news/4684/bundesliga-kick-off-times-change-from-the-2021-22-season|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n{{further|History of German football}}\nBefore the formation of the Bundesliga, German football was played at an amateur level in a large number of sub-regional leagues until, in 1949, part-time (semi-) professionalism was introduced and only five regional ''Oberligen (Premier Leagues)'' remained. Regional champions and runners-up played a series of playoff matches for the right to compete in a final game for the national championship. On 28 January 1900, a national association, the [[German Football Association|Deutscher Fu\u00dfball Bund]] (DFB) had been founded in [[Leipzig]] with 86 member clubs. The first recognized national championship team was [[VfB Leipzig]], who beat [[DFC Prague]] 7\u20132 in a game played at [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] on 31 May 1903.\n\nThrough the 1950s, there were continued calls for the formation of a central professional league, especially as professional leagues in other countries began to draw Germany's best players away from the semi-professional domestic leagues. At the international level, the German game began to falter as German teams often fared poorly against professional teams from other countries. A key supporter of the central league concept was national team head coach Sepp Herberger who said, \"If we want to remain competitive internationally, we have to raise our expectations at the national level.\"{{cite quote|date=September 2020|reason=the statement is simple enough, but should be referenced.}}\n\nMeanwhile, in East Germany, a separate league was established with the formation of the [[DDR-Oberliga|DS-Oberliga]] (Deutscher Sportausschuss Oberliga) in 1950. The league was renamed the Football Oberliga DFV in 1958 and was generally referred to simply as the DDR-Liga or DDR-Oberliga. The league fielded 14 teams with two relegation spots.\n\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Auswahl der Bundesligavereine 1963-64.png|400px]] \n{{main|Introduction of the Bundesliga}}\n[[File:Westfalenhalle 1 Dortmund.JPG|thumb|right|The Bundesliga was founded at the annual DFB convention at the [[Westfalenhallen]] in [[Dortmund]] on 28 July 1962]]\nThe defeat of the national team by Yugoslavia (0\u20131) in a [[1962 World Cup]] quarter-final game in Chile was one impetus (of many) towards the formation of a national league. At the annual [[Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Bund|DFB]] convention under new DFB president [[Hermann G\u00f6smann]] (elected that very day) the Bundesliga was created in [[Dortmund]] at the [[Westfalenhallen]] on 28 July 1962 to begin play starting with the [[1963\u201364 Bundesliga|1963\u201364 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bundesliga.de/en/liga/news/2006/index.php?f=36345.php |title=How everything got started| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716015251/http://www.bundesliga.de/en/liga/news/2006/index.php?f=36345.php\n | archive-date=16 July 2007 |publisher=bundesliga.de }}</ref>\n\nAt the time, there were five ''Oberligen'' (premier leagues) in place representing West Germany's North, South, West, Southwest, and Berlin. East Germany, behind the Iron Curtain, maintained its separate league structure. 46 clubs applied for admission to the new league. 16 teams were selected based on their success on the field, economic criteria and representation of the various Oberligen.\n*From [[Oberliga Nord (1947\u201363)|Oberliga Nord]]: [[Eintracht Braunschweig]], [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]], [[Hamburger SV]]\n*From [[Oberliga West (1947\u201363)|Oberliga West]]: [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[1.

Early favorite 1. FC K\u00f6ln was the first Bundesliga champion (with 45:15 points) over second place clubs Meidericher SV and Eintracht Frankfurt (both 39:21).\n\n===Reunification===\nFollowing [[German reunification]] in 1990, the East German leagues were merged into the West German system. [[Dynamo Dresden]] and [[FC Hansa Rostock]] were seeded into the top-tier Bundesliga division ahead of the [[1991\u201392 Bundesliga]], with other clubs being sorted into lower tiers.{{cn|date=November 2023}}\n\n===21st century===\n[[Gazprom]] became a major sponsor of Bundesliga football in 2006, with [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]'s climb to the top of the company.<ref name=\"dwdgp\">{{cite news |title=Russia's Gazprom - Corrupt politicians and the greed of the west |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCNHwH9MxGA |agency=YouTube |publisher=DW Documentary |date=10 February 2024}}</ref>\n\n==Competition format==\n[[File:Elia son.JPG|upright=0.9|thumb|right|[[Son Heung-min]] of [[Hamburger SV]] against [[Eljero Elia]] of [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in the [[Nordderby]]]]\n\nThe German football champion is decided strictly by play in the Bundesliga. Each club plays every other club once at home and once away. Originally, a victory was worth two points, with one point for a draw and none for a loss. Since the 1995\u201396 season, a victory has been worth three points, while a draw remains worth a single point, and zero points are given for a loss. The club with the most points at the end of the season becomes the German champion. Currently, the top four clubs in the table qualify automatically for the group phase of the [[UEFA Champions League]]. The two teams at the bottom of the table are relegated into the 2. Bundesliga, while the top two teams in the 2. Bundesliga are promoted. The 16th-placed team (third-last) in the 1. Bundesliga and the third-placed team in the 2. Bundesliga play a two-leg play-off match. The winner of this match plays the next season in the 1. Bundesliga, and the losing side in the 2. Bundesliga.\n\nIf teams are level on points, tie-breakers are applied in the following order:\n#Goal difference for the entire season\n#Total goals scored for the entire season\n#Head-to-head results (total points)\n#Head-to-head goals scored\n#Head-to-head away goals scored\n#Total away goals scored for the entire season\n\nIf two clubs are still tied after all of these tie-breakers have been applied, a single match is held at a neutral site to determine the placement. However, this has never been necessary in the history of the Bundesliga.\n\nIn terms of team selection, matchday squads must have no more than five non-EU representatives. Nine substitutes are permitted to be selected, from which five can be used in the duration of the game.\n\n===Changes in league structure===\n*Number of teams:\n** 1963\u201364 to 1964\u201365: 16\n** 1965\u201366 to 1990\u201391: 18\n** [[1991\u201392 Bundesliga|1991\u201392]]: 20, while the [[East Germany|East German]] league was being included after [[German reunification]]\n** Since 1992\u201393: 18\n*Number of teams relegated (automatic relegation except as noted):\n** 1963\u201364 to 1973\u201374: 2\n** 1974\u201375 to 1980\u201381: 3\n** 1981\u201382 to 1990\u201391: 2 automatic plus the 16th-place team in the First Bundesliga played a two-leg relegation match against the third-place team of the Second Bundesliga for the final spot in the First Bundesliga\n** 1991\u201392: 4\n** 1992\u201393 to 2007\u201308: 3\n** Since 2008\u201309: 2 automatic plus the 16th-place team in the First Bundesliga playing a two-leg relegation match against the third-place team of the Second Bundesliga for the final spot in the First Bundesliga\n\n===Qualification for European competitions===\n*1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place: Group stage of [[UEFA Champions League]]\n*5th place: Group stage of [[UEFA Europa League]]\n*6th place: Play-off round of [[UEFA Europa Conference League]]\n*Until the 2016\u201317 season, an additional place in the Europa League could also be granted via the [[UEFA Fair Play ranking|UEFA Fair Play]] mechanism. This rule was maintained from the UEFA Cup. The last Bundesliga team to gain entry to the UEFA Cup via the fair play rule was [[FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|2005\u201306]].\n*[[DFB-Pokal]] (German Cup) winner: Qualifies for the group stage of Europa League regardless of league position.\n**Until 2015\u201316, if the Cup winner qualified for the Champions League or Europa League by more than one method, the cup winner's place in the Europa League went to the losing cup finalist if it had not already qualified for European competition, entering the competition a stage earlier than if it had won the Cup. This rule was retained from the Europa League's predecessor, the UEFA Cup. From 2015\u201316, the runners-up no longer qualified for the Europa League, and the Europa League berth reserved for the DFB-Pokal winners is transferred to the highest finisher below the european qualification places.\n*** Prior to 2015\u201316, the team that benefited from that rule did not necessarily have to be a Bundesliga member. For example, although [[2. Bundesliga]] sides [[Alemannia Aachen]] lost to [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in the [[2003\u201304 DFB-Pokal#Final|2004 DFB-Pokal Final]], Alemannia secured an entry in the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Cup]], because Werder qualified for the Champions League as First Bundesliga champions.\n\nThe number of German clubs which may participate in UEFA competitions is determined by [[UEFA coefficients]], which takes into account the results of a particular nation's clubs in UEFA competitions over the preceding five years.\n\n;History of European qualification\n*European Cup/Champions League:\n** Up to and including 1996\u201397: German champion only.\n** 1997\u201399: Top two teams; champions automatically into group phase, runners-up entered the qualifying round.\n** 1999\u20132008: Top two teams automatically into first group phase (only one group phase starting in 2003\u201304). Depending on the DFB's [[UEFA coefficients]] standing, either one or two other clubs (most recently one) entered at the third qualifying round; winners at this level entered the group phase.\n** 2008\u201311: Top two teams automatically into group phase. Third placed team had to play in the play-off round for the right to play in the group stage.\n*UEFA Cup/Europa League:\n** From 1971\u201372 to 1998\u201399, UEFA member nations could send between one and four teams to the UEFA Cup. Germany was always entitled to send at least three teams to the competition and often as many as four. From 1978\u201379, the number of participants was determined by the DFB's UEFA coefficient standing, prior to this the method for deciding the number of participants is unknown. The best performing teams in the league other than the champion would qualify, although if one of these teams was also winner of the [[DFB-Pokal]] then they would enter the Cup Winners' Cup instead and their UEFA Cup place would be taken by the next highest-placed team in the league (5th or 6th place). Briefly in the mid-1970s the DFB decided to allocate the last UEFA Cup place to the DFB-Pokal runner-up instead of a third or fourth team qualified by performance in the league, meaning that at this point the DFB-Pokal qualified two teams for European competition (winners for the Cup Winners' Cup, runners-up for the UEFA Cup). This policy was unique amongst UEFA member associations and was dropped after only a few seasons. Starting with the 1999\u20132000 season and the abolition of the Cup Winners' Cup (which was then folded into the UEFA Cup), the DFB-Pokal winner now automatically qualified for the UEFA Cup alongside, depending on the DFB's UEFA coefficients standing, between one and three extra participants (if the DFB-Pokal winner also qualified for the Champions League, they were replaced by the DFB-Pokal runner-up; if they were also qualified for the Champions League, the UEFA Cup place went to the next best placed team in the league not otherwise qualified for European competition). Since 1999, the DFB has always been entitled to enter a minimum of three clubs in the UEFA Cup/Europa League, and at times as many as four (the maximum for any European federation). Teams that entered via UEFA's Fair Play mechanism, or those that entered through the now-defunct [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]], did not count against the national quota. From [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 2006|2006]] through the final Intertoto Cup in [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 2008|2008]], only one First Bundesliga side was eligible to enter the Intertoto Cup and possibly earn a UEFA Cup berth.
