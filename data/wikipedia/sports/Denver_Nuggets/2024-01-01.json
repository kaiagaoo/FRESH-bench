Following that season, the NBL merged with the Basketball Association of America (BAA), with the newly unified circuit named the [[National Basketball Association]] to reflect the merger. The Denver Nuggets played the [[1949\u201350 NBA season|1949\u201350 season]] as one of the charter NBA teams before folding. This franchise's records and statistics remain separate from the modern-day Denver Nuggets.\n\n[[File:Byron Beck.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byron Beck]], a [[University of Denver]] alumnus, is shown wearing the \"'''Denver Rockets'''\" uniform]]\nThe current franchise traces its roots to 1967, when one of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA)'s charter franchises was awarded to a group in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], headed by Southern California businessman James Trindle. However, Trindle was unable to find a suitable arena in the Kansas City area. League commissioner [[George Mikan]] suggested moving the team to Denver. After agreeing to name Denver resident and former NBA player [[Vince Boryla]] as general manager, Trindle moved his team to Denver as the Denver Larks, named after Colorado's state bird.<ref name=\"nuggetscompanyhistory\">[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Denver-Nuggets-Company-History.html Denver Nuggets history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121112849/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Denver-Nuggets-Company-History.html |date=January 21, 2012 }} at FundingUniverse</ref> The Trindle group was severely undercapitalized, leading Mikan to order the Larks to post a $100,000 performance bond or lose the franchise. Hours before the deadline, Trindle sold a \u2154 controlling interest to Denver trucking magnate Bill Ringsby for $350,000.

Haywood was one of the first players to turn pro before graduating from college, and the NBA initially refused to let him play in the league. Haywood averaged nearly 30 points and 19.5 rebounds per game in his only ABA season, being named ABA MVP, ABA rookie of the year, as well as the All-Star Game MVP. The team finished 51\u201333, winning their division, before exiting the playoffs in the 2nd round.\n\nJust before the start of the 1970\u201371 season, Haywood signed with the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], jumping to the NBA.

The winning choice was \"Nuggets\", in honor of the original [[Denver Nuggets (original)|Nuggets]] team in Denver from 1948 to 1950, the last year as a charter member of the NBA. Their new logo was a miner \"discovering\" an ABA ball. Goldberg and Fischer in turn sold the team to a local investment group in 1976.\n\nWith the drafting and signing of future Hall of Fame player [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]] out of [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]] and [[Marvin Webster]], and the acquisitions of [[Dan Issel]] and [[Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)|Bobby Jones]], with [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] coaching, they had their best seasons in team history in their first two as the Nuggets. Playing in the [[Denver Auditorium Arena]] for the last season the 1974\u201375 team went 65\u201316, including a 40\u20132 record at home.

The Nuggets continued their strong play early on in the NBA, as they won division titles in their first two seasons in the league, and missed a third by a single game. However, neither of these teams were ultimately successful in the postseason. Similarly to the other new NBA teams, the Nuggets were saddled with stiff financial obligations upon joining the NBA, including a $2 million entry fee. [[Red McCombs]] bought the team in 1978.\n\nIn 1979, Brown left the team, helping usher in a brief decline in their performance. It ended in 1981, when they hired [[Doug Moe]] as a head coach. Moe brought with him a \"motion offense\" philosophy, a style of play focusing on attempting to move the ball until someone got open. Moe was also known for not paying as much attention to defense as other NBA coaches. The offense helped the team become highly competitive. During the 1980s, the Nuggets often{{quantify|date=June 2015}} scored in excess of 115 points a game, and during the 1981\u201382 season, they scored at least 100 points in every game. The NBA-record streak was halted at 136 consecutive games.<ref name=\"NBA Records\">{{cite book|chapter=Team Records: Offense|chapter-url=https://turnernbahangtime.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/2017-18-official-nba-guide_v2.pdf#page=205|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|title=2017\u201318 Official National Basketball Association Guide|url=https://turnernbahangtime.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/2017-18-official-nba-guide_v2.pdf|date=October 30, 2017|access-date=June 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225072133/https://turnernbahangtime.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/2017-18-official-nba-guide_v2.pdf#page=205|archive-date=December 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the 1981\u201382 season, the Nuggets set the league scoring record for the highest points per game average at 126.5 points.\n\n===1982\u20131989: The Alex English era===\nAnchored by scoring machines [[Alex English]] and [[Kiki Vandeweghe]] at the two forward spots, and Dan Issel at center, Denver led the league in scoring, with English and Vandeweghe both averaging above 25 points per game. It was a novel strategy, allowing the Nuggets to top the Midwest Division and qualify for the playoffs during that span. (On December 13, 1983, the Nuggets and the visiting [[Detroit Pistons]] combined for an NBA record 370 points, with Detroit winning in triple [[Overtime (sport)#Basketball|overtime]], 186\u2013184.) At the end of the season, English won the NBA scoring title, becoming the only Nugget to win the award despite the heavily favored offensive play of Doug Moe. In [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984\u201385]], they made it to the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] finals after being perennial playoff contenders, and they lost in five games to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nVandeweghe was traded before the 1984\u201385 season to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] for 6\u20133 rebounding guard [[Fat Lever]], undersized power forward [[Calvin Natt]] and center [[Wayne Cooper (basketball)|Wayne Cooper]]. Spearheaded by Alex English and supported by the three new acquisitions and defensive specialists [[Bill Hanzlik]] and [[TR Dunn]], the team replicated its success in the Western Conference despite the loss of Vandeweghe. They even managed to win 54 games in the [[1987\u201388 NBA season|1987\u201388 season]], the most they had ever won as an NBA team. However, the Mavericks eliminated the Nuggets in the second round of the 1988 NBA Playoffs. McCombs sold the team to [[Sidney Shlenker]] in 1985. Shlenker, in turn, sold the team to [[COMSAT]] in 1989.\n\n===1989\u20131991: A period of decline===\nMoe left the team in 1990, and was replaced by [[Paul Westhead]]. Westhead also believed in a \"[[run and gun (basketball)|run and gun]]\" style of play, and gave the green light for players like [[Michael Adams (basketball)|Michael Adams]] and [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf|Chris Jackson]] to light up the scoreboards within seconds of possession.\n\nHowever, Westhead cared even less about defense than Moe. As a result, the Nuggets gave up points so quickly that even their prolific offense could not keep up. They finished with the worst record in the league during the 1990\u201391 season, despite setting many scoring records. As an insult, many sportswriters nicknamed the team at the time as the \"Enver Nuggets\" (as in no \"D\", or no defense).\n\n===1991\u20131996: The Dikembe Mutombo era===\n[[File:Dikembe mutombo as a nugget.jpg|alt=|thumb|Dikembe Mutombo was drafted by the Nuggets in 1991.]]\nDenver took a positive step in rebuilding by drafting [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown University]] center [[Dikembe Mutombo]] in 1991. Mutombo finished runner-up to [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] for the NBA rookie of the year that season. Denver finished 24\u201358 that year.\n\nDenver fired Westhead prior to the 1992\u201393 season and hired former star player [[Dan Issel]] as his successor. The Nuggets had two lottery picks that year and drafted [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|University of Notre Dame]] [[forward (basketball)|forward]] [[LaPhonso Ellis]] and [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|University of Virginia]] [[guard (basketball)|guard]] [[Bryant Stith]]. Denver improved to 36\u201346, just missing the playoffs that year.\n\nDenver ditched their rainbow colors for a dark navy, metallic gold and wine color scheme starting in the 1993\u201394 season. Led by Mutombo, [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf]] (who changed his name from Chris Jackson prior to the season), and Ellis, Denver finished with its first winning season since the Doug Moe era at 42\u201340. Denver clinched the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, playing the first place [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. Denver was a heavy underdog, having only a couple of players on their roster with actual NBA playoff experience. After dropping the first two games of the five-game set in [[Seattle]], the series returned to Denver. Denver won both games and tied the series at 2. The Nuggets made NBA history in Game 5, upsetting Seattle in overtime 98\u201394. They became the first 8th-seeded team to defeat a 1st-seeded team in NBA playoff history. Denver almost repeated the feat before falling to the [[Utah Jazz]] in Game 7 of the second round.\n\nDenver acquired Sonics sharp-shooter [[Dale Ellis]] in the off-season and drafted [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|University of Michigan]] guard [[Jalen Rose]]. Denver struggled, causing Issel to resign as coach partway into the season. Assistant Coach [[Gene Littles]] assumed control for a brief period before relinquishing control to general manager [[Bernie Bickerstaff]]. Denver rebounded and earned the eighth seed again in the playoffs, finishing 41\u201341. The Nuggets were swept by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the first round of the playoffs that season.\n\nFollowing that season, Denver acquired [[Antonio McDyess]] in a draft-day trade with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. McDyess was the face of the franchise for the next few years, as Mutombo left after the 1995\u201396 season for the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Ellis missed the majority of the next few seasons due to recurring knee and leg injuries, Rose was traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] for [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]], and Abdul-Rauf was traded to the [[Sacramento Kings]] prior to the 1996\u201397 season.\n\n===1996\u20132003: Another period of struggle===\nAfter finishing the 1996\u201397 season with the fourth-worst record in the league (21\u201361), the Nuggets sent [[Antonio McDyess]] to the [[Phoenix Suns]], and [[Dale Ellis]] returned to Seattle. Denver flirted with history in the [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398]], by nearly setting the mark for fewest wins in an 82-game season (11). They tied the then-NBA's all-time worst single-season losing streak at [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|23]]\u2014only one game shy of the overall worst mark of 24 by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] of the early 1980s. The losing streak was later broken by the Cavaliers in 2011 and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in 2014 with 26 consecutive losses. Several years later, the Nuggets tied for the worst record in the NBA in [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303]], also with the Cavaliers.\n\n====New ownerships====\nThe team's struggles in the late 1990s were due in part to ownership instability. COMSAT bought the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Quebec Nordiques]] in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the [[Colorado Avalanche]]. However, its diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent Entertainment Group, the umbrella corporation for its sporting assets, to [[Liberty Media]].<ref name=\"nuggetscompanyhistory\"/> However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought the [[Atlanta Braves]]), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Graser |first1=Marc |title=Liberty Media buys Ascent |url=https://variety.com/2000/biz/news/liberty-media-buys-ascent-1117776651/ |website=Variety |date=February 23, 2000 |access-date=February 25, 2019 |archive-date=February 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225103022/https://variety.com/2000/biz/news/liberty-media-buys-ascent-1117776651/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAfter almost two years, Ascent sold the Avalanche and Nuggets to [[Walmart]] heirs [[Bill Laurie|Bill]] and [[Nancy Walton Laurie|Nancy Laurie]] for $400 million. However, a group of Ascent shareholders sued, claiming that the sale price was several million dollars too low. Ascent then agreed to sell the Avalanche and Nuggets to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $461 million.<ref name=Press>Schley, Stewart.

Colorado Biz, June 1, 2006.</ref>\n\nHowever, a new wrinkle appeared when the city of Denver refused to transfer the parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had bought the teams in his own name, and the city wanted to protect taxpayers in the event Sturm either died or sold the teams. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he was not willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.<ref name=bizjournal>Moore, Paula.

When the Nuggets joined the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] in the [[1976\u201377 NBA season|1976\u201377 season]], they retained the pick-axe logo on their jerseys from the ABA days. The home uniforms feature \"Nuggets\" in red, with a red pick-axe inside a blue oval, and gold numbers with blue trim in front, blue numbers and letters at the back. The road uniforms were blue, with \"Denver\" in blue with a blue pick-axe in a red oval, and gold numbers in front, white numbers and letters at the back. The Nuggets simplified their uniforms following their inaugural season in the NBA. From 1977 to 1982, their home uniforms were white, with a \"Nuggets\" script written across the chest in a darker royal blue, with gold trim around the script and jersey numbers. The royal blue away jersey had \"Denver\" written across the chest in white, with gold trim.\n\n===1981\u20131993: Rainbow City Skyline===\nFrom [[1981\u201382 NBA season|1981\u201382]] through [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]], the Nuggets wore the Denver \"rainbow city\" skyline across the chest and back on both the home and away uniforms. Some fans also call the iconic 1980s logo the \"[[Tetris]]\" logo, due to the buildings that shadow the mountains on the logo which are in the shape of squares. The initial home uniforms were white with navy and green trim, with \"Nuggets\" and the uniform number in gold with blue trim. The player names were written in block lettering and in a straight position. In 1985, they changed the shade of blue to royal and eliminated green, and in 1986, changed the back numbers to royal blue. In 1991, coinciding with the debut of [[Dikembe Mutombo]], the word \"Nuggets\" became white with royal blue and gold trim. The road uniforms were initially navy blue with green trim, with \"Denver\" and the uniform number in white with gold trim, before likewise changing it to royal blue, with gold serifed block letters for player names in an arch (royal blue in home uniforms). The font and \"skyline\" logo were later reintroduced on alternate jerseys beginning with the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]].\n\n===1993\u20132003: Navy blue, metallic gold and maroon===\nFor the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]], the Nuggets drastically changed their look, with a navy blue, metallic gold and maroon color scheme on their uniforms. The \"rainbow city skyline,\" which had been synonymous with the team since 1981, was replaced with a logo that featured a navy blue snow-capped mountain above an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" wordmark in metallic gold, and a curved maroon ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark positioned in between the mountain and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark. The home jerseys had a \"Nuggets\" script in a modified version of the typeface Aachen across the chest in navy blue, with maroon and metallic gold trim around the script and numbers, while the navy blue away jerseys had the same script in metallic gold, with maroon and white trim. The Nuggets wore these uniforms for a decade, until the end of the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]].\n\n===2003\u20132018: Powder blue, navy blue and gold===\nFor the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]], the Nuggets made another uniform change, coinciding with [[Carmelo Anthony]]'s debut, with a color scheme of powder blue, gold (yellow) and royal blue. The primary logo, featuring a snow-capped mountain, curved ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark and an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" workmark ''(see previous section)'', was modified, with the mountain royal blue, the ribbon powder blue and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark a golden yellow. Like the 1990s uniforms, the Nuggets' revised jerseys also had the \"Aachen\" typeface across the chest\u2014it was \"Nuggets\" in powder blue, with royal blue and gold trim on the home white jersey, while the powder blue road jerseys had \"Denver\" in white, with gold and royal blue trim. These jerseys, along with the team logo, were tweaked prior to the [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309 season]], with the royal blue replaced by the shade of navy blue that was part of the team's color scheme from 1993 to 2003. These jerseys were used until the [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2014\u201315 season]], while the snow-capped mountain logo would serve as the team's primary logo until the [[2017\u201318 NBA season|2017\u201318 season]].\n\nIn the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]], the Nuggets also introduced an alternate logo, as well as an alternate navy blue uniform. The alternate logo featured twin intersecting gold pick-axes in a powder blue circle, with a half-white/half-yellow \"mountain peaks\" at the top of the circle and a basketball with gold outlining and navy blue accents at the bottom of the circle. The navy blue jersey featured an alternate \"Nuggets\" script in gold, with navy blue interior trim and powder blue outlining. This uniform was used until the end of the [[2011\u201312 NBA season|2011\u201312 season]], while the circular \"pick axe\" logo would become the team's new primary logo for the [[2018\u201319 NBA season|2018\u201319 season]].\n\nWhile the \"pick axe\" logo was officially introduced in 2005, former NBA director of creative services Tom O'Grady had planned on introducing the logo as early as 1998, but then-NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] was not informed of the possible logo change. As a result, the logo was shelved until was brought in as an alternate seven years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=LOGOMAN BLOG #7 \u2013 NUGGETS OF WISDOM.

Navy blue numerals trimmed in gold, as well as navy blue nameplates, were featured on both the home and away jerseys. The alternate gold \"skyline\" jerseys were also tweaked, with a retro \"Nuggets\" wordmark (that was used on the 1980s rainbow skyline jerseys) in navy blue trimmed in white.

The current color scheme consists of midnight blue (navy), sunshine yellow, flatirons red (maroon) and skyline blue (royal)\u2014the latter color is only featured on the \"Statement\" jersey and two of the team's new alternate logos. Powder blue, which had been part of the team's color scheme since 2003, was eliminated from all logos and uniforms. The white \"Association\" jersey features \"Nuggets\" in flatirons red, with sunshine yellow trim and midnight blue numbers with sunshine yellow trim, while the midnight blue \"Icon\" jersey features \"Denver\" in sunshine yellow, with flatirons red trim and white numbers with flatirons red trim.

A modernized version of the skyline logo adorns the waistline. The circular \"pick axe logo,\" which had served as the Nuggets' alternate logo since 2005, became the team's new primary logo, replacing the snow-capped mountain/enlarged western-style wordmark logo that had served as the team's primary logo (in three different versions) since 1993.
