The road jersey was white, with white, blue and green sleeve stripes and had blue numerals and names. The socks were blue and had the same green and white striping pattern seen on the blue jerseys. Black shoes were worn for the first four seasons, one of the few NFL teams that did so in the late 1970s, at a time when most teams were wearing white shoes. They would switch to white shoes in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yantz|first=Mickel|title=Seahawk Uni History|url=http://mickelyantz.com/HawksUnis.html|access-date=April 29, 2013|archive-date=January 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112031750/http://mickelyantz.com/HawksUnis.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=December 29, 2023 |title=The Bold Blue & White \u2013 A History of Seattle Seahawks Uniforms |url=https://www.customizedguys.com/a-history-of-seattle-seahawks-uniforms/ |access-date=April 24, 2024 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn {{nfly|1983}}, coinciding with the arrival of [[Chuck Knox]] as head coach, the uniforms were updated slightly.

It had the Seahawks logo streaking through the number 10. In 1994, the year of the NFL's 75th Anniversary, the Seahawks changed the style of their numbering to something more suitable for the team; Pro Block from then until 2001. That same year, the Seahawks wore a vintage jersey for select games resembling the 1976\u201382 uniforms. However, the helmet facemasks remained blue. The logos also became sewn on instead of being screen-printed. In 2000, [[Shaun Alexander]]'s rookie year and [[Cortez Kennedy]]'s last, the Seattle Seahawks celebrated their 25th Anniversary; the logo was worn on the upper left chest of the jersey. In 2001, the Seahawks switched to the new [[Reebok]] uniform system still in their then-current uniforms after that company signed a 10-year deal to be the exclusive uniform supplier to the NFL, but it would be their last in this uniform after the season ended. Prior to this, various companies made the team's uniforms.\n\n[[File:NFCW-Uniform-Combination-SEA.PNG|thumb|right|350px|Seattle Seahawks uniform combinations, 2002\u20132011.

The Wordmark was designed by Mark Verlander and the logo was designed by NFL Properties in-house design team. The colors were modified to a lighter \"Seahawks Blue\", a darker \"Seahawks Navy\" and lime green piping. The helmets also were changed from silver to the lighter \"Seahawks Blue\" color after a fan poll was conducted. Silver would not be seen again until 2012. The logo artwork was also subtly altered, with an arched eyebrow and a forward-facing pupil suggesting a more aggressive-looking bird. At first, the team had planned to wear silver helmets at home and blue helmets on the road, but since NFL rules forbid the use of multiple helmets, the team held the fan poll to decide which color helmet would be worn. The team had usually worn all blue at home and all white on the road since 2003, but late in the 2009 season, the Seahawks wore the white jersey-blue pants combo. The blue jersey and white pants combo has been worn for only one regular-season game, the 2005 season opener at the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], while the white jersey and blue pants combination has not been worn regularly since late in the 2002 season, with the exception of late in the 2009 season. In 2009, the Seahawks once again wore the white jersey and blue pants combination for road games against [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota]] (November 22), [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]] (November 29), [[Houston Texans|Houston]] (December 13), and [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]] (December 27).\n\nThe Seahawks wore their home blue jerseys during [[Super Bowl XL]] despite being designated as the visitor, since the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], the designated home team, elected to wear their white jerseys.\n\n[[File:Seattle Seahawks 2009 players.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Seahawks players wearing green jerseys in 2009.]]\nOn September 27, 2009, the Seahawks wore lime green jerseys for the first time, paired with new dark navy blue pants in a game against the [[Chicago Bears]]. The jerseys matched their new sister team, the expansion [[Seattle Sounders FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] who wear green jerseys with blue pants. On December 6, 2009, the Seahawks wore their Seahawks blue jersey with the new dark navy blue pants for the first time, in a game against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The Seahawks broke out the same combo two weeks later against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], and two weeks after that in the 2009 regular-season finale against the [[Tennessee Titans]].
