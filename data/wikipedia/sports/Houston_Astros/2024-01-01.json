Spearheaded by the [[Killer B's (Houston Astros)|Killer B's]], a collection of prominent hitters that included the Astros' only [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] members [[Craig Biggio]] and [[Jeff Bagwell]], the Astros began reaching major prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s with four further division titles and two [[Major League Baseball Wild Card|Wild Card]] appearances, culminating in their first [[World Series]] appearance in [[2005 World Series|2005]] where they were swept by the AL's [[Chicago White Sox]]. \n\nAfter a major slump throughout the next decade, the team was purchased by business owner [[Jim Crane]] in 2011 for $680 million. Under Crane's ownership, the Astros embraced [[sabermetrics]] and pioneered new analytical technologies in their transition to the American League, and by the mid-2010s has transformed from a poor franchise into one of MLB's most dominant and successful clubs. Since then, the Astros have won over 100 games in four seasons, appeared in a record six consecutive [[American League Championship Series]], and won four of the last six American League pennants. During this time, the Astros won the [[2017 World Series]], their first championship, against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]; however, this win proved controversial after the Astros were caught in a [[Houston Astros sign stealing scandal|sign stealing scandal]].

A new artificial turf was created called \"[[AstroTurf]]\" and Houston would be involved in yet another change in the way the game was played.<ref>[http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/ballparks/astrodome/ Astrodome \u2013 history, photos and more] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023010615/http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/ballparks/astrodome/ |date=2017-10-23 }} Ballparks of Baseball.</ref>\n\nWith new manager [[Grady Hatton]], the Astros started the 1966 season strong. By May they were in second place in the National League and looked like a team that could contend. [[Joe Morgan]] was named as a starter on the [[1966 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Team]]. The success did not last as they lost [[Jimmy Wynn]] for the season after he crashed into an outfield fence in [[Philadelphia]] and Morgan had broken his knee cap.<ref name=\"AstrosDaily\" /> The [[1967 Houston Astros season|1967 season]] saw first baseman [[Eddie Mathews]] join the Astros. The slugger hit his 500th home run while in Houston. He would be traded late in the season and [[Doug Rader]] would be promoted to the big leagues. Rookie [[Don Wilson (baseball)|Don Wilson]] pitched a no-hitter on June 18. Wynn also provided some enthusiasm in 1967. The 5&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in Wynn was becoming known not only for how often he hit home runs, but also for how far he hit them. Wynn set club records with 37 home runs, and 107 RBIs. It was also in 1967 that Wynn hit his famous home run onto [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|Interstate 75]] in [[Cincinnati]].<ref name=\"baseball-reference.com\">[https://www.baseball-reference.com/w/wynnj01.shtml Jimmy Wynn Statistics]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Baseball-Reference.com''</ref> As the season came to a close, the Astros found themselves again in ninth place and with a winning percentage below .500. The team looked good on paper, but could not make it work on the field.\n\nApril 15, 1968, saw a pitching duel for the ages. The Astros' [[Don Wilson (baseball)|Don Wilson]] and the Mets' [[Tom Seaver]] faced each other in a battle that lasted six hours. Seaver went ten innings, allowing no walks and just two hits. Wilson went nine innings, allowing five hits and three walks. After the starters exited, eleven relievers (seven for the Mets and four for the Astros) tried to end the game. The game finally ended in the 24th inning when Aspromonte hit a shot toward Mets shortstop [[Al Weis]]. Weis had been perfect all night at short, but he was not quick enough to make the play. The ball zipped into left field, allowing [[Norm Miller (baseball)|Norm Miller]] to score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/records_registry12.stm |title=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018093725/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/records_registry12.stm |archive-date=2012-10-18 }}</ref>\n\nWith baseball expansion and trades, the Astros had dramatically changed in [[1969 Houston Astros season|1969]]. Aspromonte was sent to the Braves and Staub was traded to the expansion [[Montreal Expos]], in exchange for outfielder [[Jes\u00fas Alou]] and first baseman [[Donn Clendenon]].  However, Clendenon refused to report to Houston, electing to retire and take job with a pen manufacturing company. The Astros asked Commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] to void the trade, but he refused. Instead, he awarded [[Jack Billingham]] and a left-handed relief pitcher to the Astros to complete the trade. Cuellar was traded to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for [[Curt Blefary]]. Other new players included catcher [[Johnny Edwards (baseball)|Johnny Edwards]], infielder [[Denis Menke]] and pitcher [[Denny Lemaster]]. Wilson continued to pitch brilliantly and on May 1 threw the second no-hitter of his career. In that game, he struck out 18 batters, tying what was then the all-time single-game mark.  He was just 24 years of age and was second to only [[Sandy Koufax]] for career no-hit wins. Wilson's no-hitter lit the Astros' fire after a miserable month of April, and six days later the team tied a major league record by turning seven double plays in a game. By May's end, the Astros had put together a ten-game winning streak. The Houston infield tandem of Menke and Joe Morgan continued to improve, providing power at the plate and great defense. Morgan had 15 homers and stole 49 bases while Menke led the Astros with 90 RBIs. The Menke/Morgan punch was beginning to come alive, and the team was responding to Walker's management style. The Astros dominated the season series against their expansion twins, the New York Mets. In one game at New York, Denis Menke and Jimmy Wynn hit [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]]s in the same inning, against a Mets team that would go on to win the World Series that same year. The Astros finished the 1969 season with a record of 81 wins, 81 losses, marking their first season of .500 ball.\n\nIn [[1970 Houston Astros season|1970]], the Astros were expected to be a serious threat in the National League West. In June, 19-year-old [[C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o]] was called up and immediately showed signs of being a superstar. The Dominican outfielder batted .310 after being called up. Not to be outdone, Menke batted .304 and [[Jes\u00fas Alou]] batted .306. The Astros' batting average was up by 19 points compared to the season before.<ref name=\"baseball-reference.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballbiography.com/cesar-cedeno-1951 |title=Cesar Cedeno |publisher=baseballbiography.com |date=1985-08-29 |access-date=2012-11-05 }}</ref> The team looked good, but the Astros' ERA was up. [[Larry Dierker]] and Wilson had winning records, but the pitching staff as a whole had an off season. Houston finished in fourth place in 1970.\n\n===1971\u20131974: The boys in orange===\nThe fashion trends of the 1970s had started taking root in baseball. Long hair and loud colors were starting to appear on team uniforms, including the Astros'. In 1971 the Astros made some changes to their uniform: they kept the same style they had in previous seasons, but inverted the colors. What was navy was now orange and what was orange was now a lighter shade of blue. The players' last names were added to the back of the jerseys. In 1972, the uniform fabric was also changed to what was at the time revolutionizing the industry \u2013 polyester. Belts were replaced by elastic waistbands, and jerseys zipped up instead of having buttons. The uniforms became popular with fans, but would last only until 1975, when the Astros would shock baseball and the fashion world.<ref name=\"HOUdaily\">{{cite web |url=http://www.astrosdaily.com/history/ |title=Astros History |publisher=Astrosdaily.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917150939/http://astrosdaily.com/history/ |archive-date=2012-09-17 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe uniforms were about the only thing that did change in 1971. The acquisition of [[Roger Metzger]] from the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the off-season moved Menke to first base and [[Bob Watson]] to the outfield. The Astros got off to a slow start and the pitching and hitting averages were down. [[Larry Dierker]] was selected to the All-Star Game in 1971, but due to an arm injury he could not make it. [[C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o]] led the club with 81 RBIs and the league with 40 doubles, but batted just .264 and had 102 strikeouts in his second season with the Astros.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cedence01.shtml |title=Cesar Cedeno Statistics and History |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228203253/http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cedence01.shtml |archive-date=2009-02-28 |url-status=live }}</ref> Pitcher [[J.

Houston sent second baseman [[Joe Morgan]], infielder [[Denis Menke]], pitcher [[Jack Billingham]], outfielder [[C\u00e9sar Ger\u00f3nimo]] and prospect [[Ed Armbrister]] to Cincinnati for first baseman [[Lee May]], second baseman [[Tommy Helms]] and infielder [[Jimmy Stewart (baseball)|Jimmy Stewart]]. The trade left Astros fans and the baseball world scratching their heads as to why [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Spec Richardson]] would give up so much for so little. The Reds, on the other hand, would shore up many problems. They had an off year in 1971, but were the National League Pennant winner in [[1972 Cincinnati Reds season|1972]].<ref name=\"Hardballtimes\" />\n\nThe Astros' acquisition of Lee May added more power to the lineup in [[1972 Houston Astros season|1972]].  May, Wynn, Rader and Cede\u00f1o all had 20 or more home runs and Watson hit 16. Cede\u00f1o also led the Astros with a .320 batting average, 55 stolen bases and made spectacular plays on the field. Cede\u00f1o made his first All-Star game in 1972 and became the first Astros player in team history to hit for the cycle in August versus the Reds.  The Astros finished the strike-shortened season at 84\u201369, their first winning season.<ref name=\"AstrosDaily\" />\n\nAstros fans had hoped for more of the same in [[1973 Major League Baseball season|1973]], but it was not to be.  The Astros run production was down, even though the same five sluggers the year before were still punching the ball out of the park. Lee May led the Astros with 28 home runs and Cesar Cede\u00f1o batted .320 with 25 home runs.  [[Bob Watson]] hit the .312 mark and drove in 94 runs.  [[Doug Rader]] and [[Jimmy Wynn]] both had 20 or more home runs.  However, injuries to their pitching staff limited the Astros to an 82\u201380 fourth-place finish.

However, there would be some bright spots that would prove to be good investments in the near future.\n\nThe year started on a sad note. Pitcher Don Wilson was found dead in the passenger seat of his car on January 5, 1975; the cause of death was asphyxiation by carbon monoxide. Wilson was 29 years old. Wilson's number 40 was retired on April 13, 1975.<ref name=\"HOUdaily\" />\n\nThe 1975 season saw the introduction of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. From the chest down, the uniform was a solid block of yellow, orange, and red stripes.<ref name=\"uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013\">{{cite web | url=https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/4/11/4213250/houston-astros-uniforms-craig-biggio-jeff-bagwell-jimmy-winn-cesar-cedeno | title=Houston Astros uniforms through history | first=Cliff | last=Corcoran | date=April 11, 2013 | publisher=SB Nation | access-date=May 8, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029013716/https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/4/11/4213250/houston-astros-uniforms-craig-biggio-jeff-bagwell-jimmy-winn-cesar-cedeno | archive-date=October 29, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref> There was also a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same multi-colored stripes ran down the pant legs. Players' numbers not only appeared on the back of the jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980.<ref name=\"HOUdaily\" />\n[[File:Cesar Cedeno - Houston Astros.jpg|thumb|[[C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o]] (1970\u20131981) is the franchise's all-time leader with 487 [[Stolen base|steals]]]]\nBesides the bright new uniforms there were some other changes. [[Lee May]] was traded to [[Baltimore Orioles|Baltimore]] for much talked about rookie second baseman [[Rob Andrews (baseball)|Rob Andrews]] and utility player [[Enos Cabell]]. In Baltimore, Cabell was stuck behind third baseman [[Brooks Robinson]], but he took advantage of his opportunity in Houston and became their everyday third baseman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballbiography.com/enos-cabell-1949 |title=Enos Cabell |publisher=baseballbiography.com |access-date=2012-11-05 }}</ref> Cabell would go on to become a big part of the team's success in later years. With May gone, [[Bob Watson]] was able to move to first base and was a bright spot in the line up, batting .324 with 85 RBI.\n\nThe two biggest moves the Astros made in the offseason were the acquisitions of [[Joe Niekro]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Cruz]]. The Astros bought Niekro from the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] for almost nothing. Niekro had bounced around the big leagues with minimal success. His older brother [[Phil Niekro]] had started teaching Joe how to throw his knuckleball and Joe was just starting to use it when he came to the Astros. Niekro won six games, saved four games and had an ERA of 3.07.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballbiography.com/joe-niekro-1944 |title=Joe Niekro |publisher=baseballbiography.com |access-date=2012-11-05 }}</ref> Acquiring [[Jos\u00e9 Cruz]] from the [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] was another big win.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hymGG28xYcoC&q=cardinals+sell+cruz+to+astros+for&pg=PA162 |title=Cardinals Encyclopedia \u2013 Michael Eisenbath \u2013 Google Boeken |date= 1999-05-14|access-date=2012-11-05|isbn=9781566397032|last1=Eisenbath |first1=Mike }}</ref> Cruz became a fixture in the Astros' outfield for several years and would eventually have his number 25 retired.\n\nDespite high expectations, [[1975 Houston Astros season|1975]] was among the Astros' worst in franchise history. Their record of 64\u201397 was far worse than even the expansion Colt .45's and would remain the worst record in franchise history until [[2011 Houston Astros season|2011]]. It was the worst record in baseball and manager [[Preston G\u00f3mez]] was fired late in the season and replaced by [[Bill Virdon]]. The Astros played .500 ball under Virdon in the last 34 games of the season.<ref name=\"HOUdaily\" /> With Virdon as the manager the Astros improved greatly in 1976 finishing in third place with an 80\u201382 record. A healthy [[C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o]] was a key reason for the Astros' success in 1976. [[Bob Watson]] continued to show consistency and led the club with a .313 average and 102 RBI.

Most of the talent was either farm grown or bought cheaply.\n\nThe [[1979 Houston Astros season|1979 season]] would prove to be a big turnaround in Astros history. During the offseason, the Astros attempted to fix some of their problem areas.

Houston took a 5\u20132 lead in the seventh; however, the Phillies came back with five runs in the inning.  The Astros came back against [[Tug McGraw]] with four singles and two two-out runs.

Ultimately, the strike would help the Astros get into the playoffs. [[Nolan Ryan]] and [[Bob Knepper]] picked up steam in the second half of the season. Ryan threw his fifth no-hitter on September 26 and finished the season with a 1.69 ERA. Knepper finished with an ERA of 2.18.<ref name=AstrosDaily/> In the wake of the strike, Major League Baseball took the winners of each \"half\" season and set up a best-of-five divisional playoff.  The [[1981 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won more games than any other team in the National League, but they won neither half of the strike-divided season.  The [[1981 Houston Astros season|Astros]] finished 61\u201349 overall, which would have been third in the division behind the Reds and the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]]. Advancing to the playoffs as winners of the second half, Houston beat Los Angeles in their first two playoff games at home, but the Dodgers took the next three in Los Angeles to advance to the [[1981 National League Championship Series|NLCS]].\n\nBy [[1982 Houston Astros season|1982]], only four players and three starting pitchers remained from the 1980 squad. The Astros were out of pennant contention by August and began rebuilding for the near future. [[Bill Virdon]] was fired as manager and replaced by original Colt .45 [[Bob Lillis]]. [[Don Sutton]] asked to be traded and was sent to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] for cash and the team gained three new prospects, including [[Kevin Bass]].

The former was supplanted by [[Dick Wagner (baseball)|Dick Wagner]], the man whose [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] defeated the Astros to win the 1979 NL West title. The latter was replaced by [[Hal Lanier]] who, like his manager mentor in St. Louis, [[Whitey Herzog]], had a hard-nosed approach to managing and espoused a playing style that focused on pitching, defense, and speed rather than home runs to win games. This style of baseball, known as [[Whiteyball]], took advantage of stadiums with deep fences and artificial turf, both of which were characteristics of the Astrodome. Lanier's style of baseball took Houston by storm. Before Lanier took over, fans were accustomed to Houston's occasional slow starts, but with Lanier leading the way, Houston got off to a hot start, winning 13 of their first 19 contests.<ref name=AstrosDaily/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/l/lanieha01.shtml |title=Hal Lanier Statistics and History |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207113348/http://www.baseball-reference.com/l/lanieha01.shtml |archive-date=2009-02-07 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/whitey-ball/ |title=Whitey Ball |publisher=Hardballtimes.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129022031/http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/whitey-ball/ |archive-date=2013-01-29 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nPrior to the start of the season the Astros acquired outfielder [[Billy Hatcher]] from the Cubs for [[Jerry Mumphrey]]. Lainer also made a change in the pitching staff, going with a three-man rotation to start the season.

[[Bill Doran (second baseman)|Bill Doran]] and [[Glenn Davis (baseball)|Glenn Davis]] held down the right side of the field but Lainer rotated the left side.

In Game 3, the Astros were ahead at [[Shea Stadium]], 5\u20134, in the bottom of the 9th when closer [[Dave Smith (pitcher, born 1955)|Dave Smith]] gave up a two-run home run to [[Lenny Dykstra]], giving the Mets a dramatic 6\u20135 win.\n\nHowever, the signature game of the series was Game 6. Needing a win to get to [[Mike Scott (baseball)|Mike Scott]] (who had been dominant in the series) in Game 7, the Astros jumped off to a 3\u20130 lead in the first inning but neither team would score again until the 9th inning. In the 9th, starting pitcher [[Bob Knepper]] would give up two runs, and once again the Astros would look to Dave Smith to close it out. However, Smith would walk [[Gary Carter]] and [[Darryl Strawberry]], giving up a sacrifice fly to [[Ray Knight]], tying the game. Despite having the go-ahead runs on base, Smith was able to escape the inning without any further damage.\n\nThere was no scoring until the 14th inning when the Mets would take the lead on a [[Wally Backman]] single and an error by left fielder [[Billy Hatcher]]. The Astros would get the run back in the bottom of the 14th when Hatcher (in a classic goat-to-hero-conversion-moment) hit one of the most dramatic home runs in [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]] history, off the left-field foul pole. In the 16th inning, Darryl Strawberry doubled to lead off the inning and Ray Knight drove him home in the next at-bat. The Mets would score a total of three runs in the inning to take what appeared an insurmountable 7\u20134 lead. With their season on the line, the Astros would nonetheless rally for two runs to come to within 7\u20136. Kevin Bass came up with the tying and winning runs on base; however [[Jesse Orosco]] would strike him out, ending the game. At the time the 16-inning game held the record for the longest in MLB postseason history.  The Mets won the series, 4\u20132.\n\nAfter the 1986 season, the team had difficulty finding success again. Several changes occurred. The \"rainbow\" uniforms were phased out, the team electing to keep a five-stripe \"rainbow\" design on the sleeves. Team favorites [[Nolan Ryan]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Cruz]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://astrosdaily.com/history/1987/ |title=Houston Astros history \u2013 1987 season |publisher=Astrosdaily.com |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514193551/http://astrosdaily.com/history/1987/ |archive-date=2013-05-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> moved on and the team entered a rebuilding phase.  [[Craig Biggio]] debuted in June 1988, joining new prospects [[Ken Caminiti]] and [[Gerald Young (baseball)|Gerald Young]]. Biggio would become the everyday catcher by 1990.  A trade acquiring [[Jeff Bagwell]] in exchange for [[Larry Andersen]] would become one of the biggest deals in Astros history. Glenn Davis was traded to [[Baltimore]] for [[Curt Schilling]], [[Pete Harnisch]] and [[Steve Finley]] in 1990.\n\n===1991\u20131999: Fine tuning and first rebranding===\nThe early 1990s were marked by the Astros' growing discontent with their home, the Astrodome.  After the Astrodome was renovated for the primary benefit of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Houston Oilers]] (who shared the Astrodome with the Astros since the 1960s), the Astros began to grow increasingly disenchanted with the facility. Faced with declining attendance at the Astrodome and the inability of management to obtain a new stadium, in the {{baseball year|1991}} off-season Astros management announced its intention to sell the team and move the franchise to the Washington, D.C. area. However, the move was not approved by other National League owners, thus compelling the Astros to remain in Houston. Shortly thereafter, McMullen (who also owned the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[New Jersey Devils]]) sold the team to Texas businessman [[Drayton McLane, Jr.|Drayton McLane]] in 1993, who committed to keeping the team in Houston.\n\nShortly after McLane's arrival, which coincided with the maturation of Bagwell and Biggio, the Astros began to show signs of consistent success. After finishing second in their division in 1994 (in a [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike year]]), 1995, and 1996, the Astros won consecutive division titles in 1997, 1998, and 1999. In the 1998 season, the Astros set a team record with 102 victories. However, each of these titles was followed by a first-round playoff elimination, in [[1998 National League Division Series|1998]] by the [[San Diego Padres]] and in [[1997 National League Division Series|1997]] and [[1999 National League Division Series|1999]] against the [[Atlanta Braves]]. The manager of these title teams was [[Larry Dierker]], who had previously been a broadcaster and pitcher for the Astros. During this period, Bagwell, Biggio, [[Derek Bell (baseball)|Derek Bell]], and Sean Berry earned the collective nickname \"[[Killer B's (Houston Astros)|The Killer Bs]]\". In later seasons, the name came to include other Astros, especially [[Lance Berkman]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=4551|title= Prospectus Notebook: Astros, Blue Jays|author= Haller, Dave|date= October 20, 2005|work= [[Baseball Prospectus]]|access-date= March 8, 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131009060644/http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=4551|archive-date= October 9, 2013|url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nCoinciding with the change in ownership, the team switched uniforms and team colors after the {{baseball year|1993}} season in order to go for a new, more serious image. The team's trademark rainbow uniforms were retired, and the team's colors changed to midnight blue and metallic gold. The \"Astros\" font on the team logo was changed to a more aggressive one, and the team's traditional star logo was changed to a stylized, \"flying\" star with an open left end. It marked the first time since the team's inception that orange was not part of the team's colors. Despite general agreement that the rainbow uniforms identified with the team had become tired (and looked too much like a minor league team according to the new owners), the new uniforms and caps were never especially popular with many Astros fans.\n[[File:Astros clinch playoff berth!.jpg|thumb|300px|Final Astros regular season game in the Astrodome on October 3, 1999]]\nOff the field, in 1994, the Astros hired one of the first [[African American]] general managers, former franchise player [[Bob Watson]]. Watson would leave the Astros after the 1995 season to become general manager of the [[New York Yankees]] and helped to lead the Yankees to a World Series championship in [[1996 World Series|1996]]. He would be replaced by [[Gerry Hunsicker]], who until 2004 would continue to oversee the building of the Astros into one of the better and most consistent organizations in the Major Leagues.\n\nHowever, in 1996, the Astros again nearly left Houston. By the mid-1990s, McLane (like McMullen before him) wanted his team out of the Astrodome and was asking the city to build the Astros a new stadium.  When things did not progress quickly toward that end, he put the team up for sale. He had nearly finalized a deal to sell the team to businessman William Collins, who planned to move them to [[Northern Virginia]]. However, Collins was having difficulty finding a site for a stadium himself, so Major League owners stepped in and forced McLane to give Houston another chance to grant his stadium wish.  Houston voters, having already lost the [[Houston Oilers]] in a similar situation, responded positively via a stadium referendum and the Astros stayed put.\n\n===2000\u20132004: New ballpark and second rebranding===\nThe 2000 season saw a move to a new stadium. Originally to be named ''The Ballpark at Union Station'' due to being located on the site of [[Union Station (Houston)|Union Station]], it was renamed ''[[Enron Field]]'' by the season opening after the naming rights were sold to energy corporation [[Enron]]. The stadium was to feature a retractable roof, a particularly useful feature with unpredictable Houston weather. The ballpark also featured more intimate surroundings than the Astrodome. In 2002, naming rights were purchased by Houston-based [[Minute Maid]], after [[Enron]] went bankrupt. The park was built on the grounds of the old [[Union Station (Houston)|Union Station]]. A locomotive moves across the outfield and whistles after home runs, paying homage to a Houston history which had 11 railroad company lines running through the city by 1860. The ballpark previously contained quirks such as \"Tal's Hill\", which was a hill in deep center field on which a flagpole stood, all in fair territory. Over the years, many highlight reel catches have been made by center fielders running up the hill to make catches. Tal's Hill was removed in the 2016\u20132017 offseason and the center field wall was moved in to {{convert|409|ft}}, which the team hoped would generate more home runs.\n\nWith the change in location also came a change in attire. Gone were the blue and gold uniforms of the 1990s in favor of a more \"[[retro]]\" look with pinstripes, a traditional baseball font, and the colors of brick red, sand and black. These colors were chosen because ownership originally wanted to rename the team the '''Houston Diesels'''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Creamer|first1=Chris|title=Astros rebrand in 2013?

They added star pitcher [[Andy Pettitte]] to a roster that already included standouts like [[Lance Berkman]] and [[Jeff Kent]] as well as veterans Bagwell and Biggio. [[Roger Clemens]], who had retired after the {{baseball year|2003}} season with the [[New York Yankees]], agreed to join former teammate Pettitte on the Astros for 2004. The one-year deal included unique conditions, such as the option for Clemens to stay home in Houston on select road trips when he wasn't scheduled to pitch.  Despite the early predictions for success, the Astros had a mediocre 44\u201344 record at the All-Star break. A lack of run production and a poor record in close games were major issues. After being booed at the 2004 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] held in Houston, manager [[Jimy Williams]] was fired and replaced by [[Phil Garner]], a star on the division-winning 1986 Astros. The Astros enjoyed a 46\u201326 record in the second half of the season under Garner and earned the NL wild-card spot.  The Astros defeated the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] 3\u20132 in the [[2004 National League Division Series|Division Series]], but would lose the [[2004 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games.  Clemens earned a record seventh Cy Young Award in 2004. Additionally, the mid-season addition of [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] in a trade with the [[Kansas City Royals]] helped the Astros tremendously in their playoff run. Despite midseason trade rumors, Beltr\u00e1n would prove instrumental to the team's hopes, hitting eight home runs in the postseason. Though he had asserted a desire to remain with the Astros, Beltr\u00e1n signed a long-term contract with the [[New York Mets]] on January 9, 2005.\n\n===2005: First World Series played in Texas===\n{{Main|2005 Houston Astros season}}\n\nIn 2005, the Astros started poorly and found themselves with a 15\u201330 record in late May. The ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' had written them off with a tombstone emblazoned with \"RIP 2005 Astros\". However, from that low point until the end of July, Houston went 42\u201317 and found themselves in the lead for an NL wild card spot. July saw the best single-month record in the club's history at 22\u20137. Offensive production had increased greatly after a slow start in the first two months.  The Astros had also developed an excellent pitching staff, anchored by [[Roy Oswalt]] (20\u201312, 2.94), [[Andy Pettitte]] (17\u20139, 2.39), and [[Roger Clemens]] (13\u20138 with a league-low ERA of only 1.87). The contributions of the other starters\u2014[[Brandon Backe]] (10\u20138, 4.76) and rookie starters [[Ezequiel Astacio]] (3\u20136, 5.67) and [[Wandy Rodr\u00edguez]] (10\u201310, 5.53)\u2014were less remarkable, but enough to push the Astros into position for a playoff run. The Astros won a wild card berth on the final day of the regular season, becoming the first team since the World Series champion 1914 Boston Braves to qualify for the postseason after being 15 games under .500.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/astros-2005-world-series-season-revisited|title=An oral history of 2005 Astros' improbable run|website=[[MLB.com]]}}</ref>\n[[File:Houston Astros 2005 NL Championship Banner.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|2005 National League championship banner at Minute Maid Park]]\nThe Astros won the [[2005 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] against the [[Atlanta Braves]], 3\u20131, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings (18), most players used by a single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours and 50 minutes). Trailing by a score of 6\u20131, [[Lance Berkman]] hit an eighth-inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6\u20135. In the bottom of the ninth, catcher [[Brad Ausmus]] hit a game-tying home run that allowed the game to continue in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but was inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In the top of the 15th inning, [[Roger Clemens]] made only his second career relief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out [[Julio Franco]], at the time the oldest player in MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the eighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning, if it came to that. Clemens struck out, but the next batter, [[Chris Burke (baseball)|Chris Burke]], hit a home run to left field to send the Astros to a 7\u20136 victory. The [[2005 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] featured a rematch of the [[2004 National League Championship Series|2004 NLCS]]. The Astros lost the first game in [[St. Louis]], but would win the next three games. Though the Astros were poised to close out the series in Game Five in Houston, Brad Lidge gave up a monstrous two-out three-run home run to [[Albert Pujols]], forcing the series to a sixth game in St. Louis, where the Astros clinched a World Series appearance. [[Roy Oswalt]] was named NLCS MVP, having gone 2\u20130 with a 1.29 ERA in the series. Honorary National League President [[Bill Giles (baseball)|Bill Giles]] presented the league champion Astros with the Warren C. Giles Trophy (named for his father) for winning the series; the younger Giles had been one of the founders of the original Colt 45 team in 1962, while his father Warren had been president of the National League from {{baseball year|1951}} to {{baseball year|1969}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vault.si.com/vault/1966/06/06/space-shot-by-the-ambitious-astros|title=Space Shot by the Ambitious Astros}}</ref>\n\nThe Astros faced the [[Chicago White Sox]] in the [[2005 World Series|World Series]]. Chicago had been considered the slight favorite but would win all four games, the first two at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] in [[Chicago]] and the final two in Houston. Game 3 marked the first World Series game held in the state of Texas, and was the longest game in World Series history, lasting 5 hours and 41 minutes.\n\nThis World Series was marked by a controversy involving the Minute Maid Park roof. MLB and Commissioner Bud Selig insisted that the Astros must play with the roof open, which mitigated the intensity and enthusiasm of the cheering Astros fans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Borden|first1=Sam|title=THE ROOF STAYS OPEN AS MLB CLOSES CASE|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/roof-stays-open-mlb-closes-case-article-1.616342|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=1 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305132936/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/roof-stays-open-mlb-closes-case-article-1.616342|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===2006\u20132009: The decline===\nIn the 2006 offseason, the team signed [[Preston Wilson]] and moved Berkman to first base, ending the long tenure of Jeff Bagwell. The Astros renewed the contract with Clemens and traded two minor league prospects to the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] for left-handed hitter [[Aubrey Huff]]. By August, Preston Wilson complained about his playing time after the return of [[Luke Scott (baseball)|Luke Scott]] from AAA Round Rock. The Astros released Wilson and he was signed by St. Louis. A dramatic season end included wins in 10 of their last 12 games, but the Astros missed a playoff appearance when they lost the final game of the season to the Atlanta Braves.\n\nOn October 31, the Astros declined a contract option on [[Jeff Bagwell]] for 2007, ending his 15-year Astros career and leading to his retirement. [[Roger Clemens]] and [[Andrew Pettitte|Andy Pettitte]] filed for free agency.  On December 12, the Astros traded [[Willy Taveras]], [[Taylor Buchholz]], and [[Jason Hirsh]] to the [[Colorado Rockies]] for Rockies pitchers [[Jason Jennings]] and [[Miguel Asencio]]. A trade with the White Sox, involving the same three Astros in exchange for Jon Garland, had been nixed a few days earlier when Buchholz reportedly failed a physical.

On June 28, second baseman [[Craig Biggio]] became the 27th MLB  player to accrue 3,000 career hits. Biggio needed three hits to reach 3,000 and ended the night with a total of five hits. That night, [[Carlos Lee]] hit a towering walk-off grand slam in the 11th inning. Lee later quipped to the media that \"he had hit a walk-off grand slam and he got second billing\", considering Biggio's achievement. On July 24, Biggio announced that he would retire at the end of the season. He hit a grand slam in that night's game which broke a 3\u20133 tie and led to an Astros win. In Biggio's last at bat, he grounded out to [[Chipper Jones]] of the Atlanta Braves.\n\nOn September 20, [[Ed Wade]] was named general manager. In his first move, he traded [[Jason Lane]] to the Padres on September 24. On September 30, Craig Biggio retired after twenty years with the team.

The starting rotation would feature [[Roy Oswalt]] and Brandon Backe as numbers one and two. [[Wandy Rodr\u00edguez]], Chac\u00f3n and [[Chris Sampson]] rounded out the bottom three slots in the rotation. [[Woody Williams]] had retired after a 0\u20134 spring training and [[Jason Jennings]] was now with Texas. On the other side of the roster, the Astros would start without Kazuo Matsui, who was on a minor league rehab assignment after a spring training injury.\n\nThe Astros regressed in 2008 and 2009, finishing with records of 86\u201375 and 74\u201388, respectively.

The Astros went 29\u201331, but finished second place in the AL West to qualify for the postseason as part of the decision by MLB to have eight postseason teams in each league for 2020 to accompany a shortened season.

The road uniforms featured the city name written in navy block letters with orange trim, and the [[flag of Texas]] patch was placed on the left sleeve. Caps were all-navy featuring \".45s\" in orange letters in front.<ref name=\"uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013\"/>\n\n===1965\u20131974: Shooting stars===\nRenamed the Astros and moving to the Astrodome in 1965, they took to the field in home uniforms featuring the \"shooting star\" design. The uniforms initially featured \"Astros\" in navy with orange trim, and the cap now sported an orange star with \"H\" in block serif letters. The road uniforms remained the same save for the Astros logo replacing the Texas flag (the same logo was also applied on the home uniforms).<ref name=\"uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013\"/>\n\nIn 1971 the Astros made some changes to their uniform: they kept the same style they had in previous seasons, but inverted the colors. What was navy was now orange and what was orange was now a lighter shade of blue. The players' last names were added to the back of the jerseys. In 1972, the uniform fabric was also changed to what was at the time revolutionizing the industry \u2013 polyester. Belts were replaced by elastic waistbands, and jerseys zipped up instead of having buttons. The uniforms became popular with fans, but would last only until 1975, when the Astros would shock baseball and the fashion world.<ref name=\"HOUdaily\"/>\n\n===1975\u20131986: Tequila sunrise/Orange rainbows===\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Joe Ferguson (baseball)|Joe Ferguson]] (left) wearing the original \"rainbow\" uniform.

Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. From the chest down, the uniform was a solid block of yellow, orange, and red stripes.<ref name=\"uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013\"/> There was also a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same multi-colored stripes ran down the pant legs. Players' numbers not only appeared on the back of the jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980, though it underwent a few minor modifications with the navy star and number style.<ref name=\"HOUdaily\" />\n\n===1980\u20131993: Rainbow shoulders===\nAlso in 1980, the Astros debuted a significantly cleaner uniform, relegating the rainbows to the sleeves. The design was initially worn on the road (with the original rainbow uniform relegated to home games), but in 1982 the rainbow shoulder look began appearing on select home games as well. In addition, the navy cap returned with this uniform and the orange cap was eventually retired in 1983. By 1987, this uniform became the Astros' primary look, retiring the original rainbow uniforms. When it first unveiled, the rainbow shoulder uniform was light grey, but by 1982, the fabric was changed to cream. A white version was added for home games that same year. Prior to the 1989 season, the pullover design was retired and buttons and belts returned to this uniform.<ref name=\"uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013\"/><ref name=\"HOUdaily\" />\n\n===1994\u20131999: Midnight blue and gold===\nCoinciding with the change in ownership, the team switched uniforms and team colors after the {{baseball year|1993}} season in order to go for a new, more serious image. The team's trademark rainbow uniforms were retired, and the team's colors changed to midnight blue and metallic gold. The \"Astros\" font on the team logo was changed to a more aggressive one, and the team's traditional star logo was changed to a stylized, \"flying\" star with an open left end.\n\nBoth the home and road uniforms featured a star substituting for the penultimate letter \"O\" in both \"Astros\" (home) and \"Houston\" (road); the road uniform was later tweaked in 1997 with the star now affixed next to the word \"Houston\". The letters were written in a more futuristic manner. The Astros also wore midnight blue alternates with \"Astros\" in white with gold trim, changed in 1997 to only feature the flying star logo. The midnight blue cap featured the flying star logo. It also marked the first time since 1982 that the Astros wore grey uniforms on the road.<ref name=\"uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013\"/><ref name=\"HOUdaily\" />\n\n===2000\u20132012: Railroad design===\nMoving to Minute Maid Park (originally Enron Field) in 2000, the Astros took to the field wearing vintage-inspired uniforms. For the first time, navy was not part of the team's palette, and the Astros uniforms featured brick red, sand and black colors. The colors were inspired by the location of their new ballpark which formerly housed a railroad depot.\n\nPrimary home uniforms featured black pinstripes with \"Astros\" in black script letters and numbers in red. The road uniforms sported \"Houston\" in red script letters and black numbers. Alternate white uniforms without pinstripes featured all letters in brick red with sand trim, initially with the brick red star logo on the left chest before switching to the \"Astros\" wordmark by 2002. The Astros also wore black alternate home and road uniforms, with \"Houston\" (road) and \"Astros\" (home) emblazoned in front, but switched to brick red alternates by 2002. The letters on both uniforms are in sand with brick red trim. Black caps with the updated star in red became the primary cap while a red cap with the sand star was used as an alternate.<ref name=\"uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013\"/><ref name=\"HOUdaily\" />\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header = Astros' \"railroad\" uniforms\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background = \n| footer = \n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background = \n| image1 = Jos\u00e9 Carlos Altuve Astros.JPG\n| caption1 = [[Jos\u00e9 Altuve]] in the primary home pinstriped uniform with black cap.\n| image2 = Jordan Lyles on July 2, 2012.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Jordan Lyles]] in the road uniform with brick red cap.\n| image3 = Roger clemens 2004.jpg\n| caption3 = [[Roger Clemens]] in the road uniform with black cap.\n| image4 = Tim Byrdak on August 8, 2009.jpg\n| caption4 = [[Tim Byrdak]] in the alternate white uniform with brick red cap.\n| image5 = Mike Hampton - 2009-07-29 (crop).jpg\n| caption5 = [[Mike Hampton]] in the alternate brick red road uniform with black cap.\n| image6 = Roger Clemens 2005 (4).jpg\n| caption6 = Roger Clemens in the alternate brick red home uniform with black cap.\n| total_width = 1000\n}}\n\n===2013\u2013present: Return to navy and orange===\nIn 2013, the Astros returned to the classic navy and orange look of previous eras. Both uniforms featured the city name (road) and team name (home) in block navy letters with orange trim, along with numbers on the left chest. Piping was also added in front. The orange alternate contained the team name and numbers in navy with white trim. The Astros also wore navy uniforms with the orange rainbow stripes along the side; the front originally featured the \"H\" star before replacing it with \"Astros\" in orange in 2016. Navy caps with the \"H\" and orange star returned as the team's primary cap, while a navy cap with orange brim was used on select games. Until 2015, the Astros also wore all-orange caps with the home uniforms, and from 2016 to 2018, the navy alternates were paired occasionally with an orange cap with navy brim.<ref name=\"uniforms, SB Nation, April 2013\"/><ref name=\"HOUdaily\" /> While the navy alternates are usually worn on Sunday home games, in recent years, it became the preferred uniform during [[Framber Valdez]]'s starts regardless of it being a home or road game.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Unexpected Greatness of Framber Valdez|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/14/framber-valdez-astros|publisher=ABG-SI LLC|work=Sports Illustrated|date=September 14, 2022|access-date=August 4, 2023}}</ref>\n\nIn 2022, the Astros were one of seven additional teams to wear [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s \"City Connect\" uniforms. The predominantly navy uniform incorporated the \"Space City\" wordmark in homage to [[NASA insignia#NASA \"worm\" logotype|NASA's \"worm\" logo]]; the lettering and numbers also incorporated said style. The uniform also added various elements from the \"[[Tequila sunrise (cocktail)|Tequila sunrise]]\" uniforms of the 1970s, including numerals on the right leg and red/orange/yellow gradients on the piping and socks. The left sleeve patch has the modified [[flag of Texas|Texas flag]] recolored to the Astros' navy and orange motif, with the \"H-star\" logo replacing the white star. All-navy caps feature the modified \"H-star\" logo incorporating a planet in orbit.

It is an outgrowth of the \"natural rivalry\" established by MLB as part of [[interleague play]] as the Rangers are a member of the [[American League]] and the Astros were a member of the [[National League (baseball)|National League]] until {{mlby|2012}}.\n\nDuring interleague play, the winner of the 6-game series was awarded the Silver Boot.

Animosity was quick to grow further after the Astros' widely publicized [[Houston Astros sign stealing scandal|sign stealing scandal]] had drawn negative attention to the organization after it was revealed the team had utilized a complex system to steal pitch signs, particularly during the 2017 World Series.

The two teams have met in four postseason rounds, all of which were won by Houston.

The resurgence of the Mariners to playoff contention in the early 2020s has fueled the rivalry in competition as the Mariners have often finished within 5 games of the Astros in the division for the past three seasons.

Previously, the team had a partnership with [[KTRH (AM)|KTRH]] (740 AM) which went from 1999 to 2012 (both stations are owned by [[iHeartMedia]]). This change suddenly made it difficult for listeners outside of Houston itself to hear the Astros, as KTRH runs 50 kilowatts of power day and night, and KBME runs only five kilowatts. As a result, KTRH is audible across much of Central, East, and South Texas, whereas KBME can only be heard in Houston, especially after dark. [[Milo Hamilton]], a veteran voice who was on the call for [[Hank Aaron]]'s 715th career home run in 1974, retired at the end of the 2012 season, after broadcasting play-by-play for the Astros since 1985. [[Dave Raymond]] and Brett Dolan shared play-by-play duty for road games, while Raymond additionally worked as Hamilton's color analyst (while Hamilton called home games only for the past few seasons before his retirement); they were not retained and instead brought in [[Robert Ford (sportscaster)|Robert Ford]] and [[Steve Sparks (pitcher, born 1965)|Steve Sparks]] to begin broadcasting for the 2013 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crawfishboxes.com/2013/2/13/3986042/robert-ford-steve-sparks-announced-as-astros-radio-team|title=Astros Announce New Radio Team|first=David|last=Coleman|date=13 February 2013|access-date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324135900/http://www.crawfishboxes.com/2013/2/13/3986042/robert-ford-steve-sparks-announced-as-astros-radio-team|archive-date=24 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSpanish language radio play-by-play is handled by Francisco Romero, and his play-by-play partner is [[Alex Trevi\u00f1o]], a former backup catcher for the club.\n\nDuring the 2012 season Astros games on television were announced by [[Bill Brown (sportscaster)|Bill Brown]] and [[Jim Deshaies]].

(Junction Jack had two \"relatives\", Junction Julie and Junction Jesse, who were not official mascots). Orbit returned after a 13-year hiatus on November 2, 2012, at the unveiling of the Astros' new look for their 2013 debut in the American League.
