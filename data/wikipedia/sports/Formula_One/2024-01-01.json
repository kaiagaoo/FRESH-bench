In the early 1990s, other teams followed suit and [[semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic gearboxes]] and [[traction control system|traction control]] were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the outcome of races more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the {{F1|1994}} season. This resulted in cars that were previously dependent on electronic aids becoming very \"twitchy\" and difficult to drive. Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only, as they \"proved difficult to police effectively\".<ref>{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Baldwin|title=F1 Plans Return of Traction Control|work=The Independent|publisher=Newspaper Publishing|date=17 February 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe teams signed a second [[Concorde Agreement]] during 1992 and a third in 1997.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ftjs031.html| title = Who owns what in F1 these days?| access-date =17 November 2007| publisher=Grandprix.com| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312003448/http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ftjs031.html| archive-date = 12 March 2007 }}</ref>\n[[File:1985 European GP Stefan Johansson 01.jpg|thumb|[[Stefan Johansson]] driving for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] at the [[1985 European Grand Prix]]]]\nOn the track, the [[McLaren]] and [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s.

This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller [[contact patch]] between tyre and track. This, according to the FIA, was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety.<ref>{{cite web | author=SEAS | title=Mosley's Equations | website=Formula 1 Dictionary | date=20 May 2019 | url=http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/mosley_equations.html | access-date=2 September 2019 | archive-date=15 September 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190915195546/http://formula1-dictionary.net/mosley_equations.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n[[File:Damon Hill 1995-2.jpg|thumb|[[Damon Hill]] driving for [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] at the [[1995 Canadian Grand Prix]]]]\nResults were mixed, as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip. This resulted in pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn resulted in less overtaking as these devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or 'dirty'. This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure, as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\n\nDrivers from [[McLaren]], [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]], [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] (formerly [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]]), and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Championship]] from {{F1|1984}} to {{F1|2008}}. The teams won every [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]] from {{F1|1979}} to {{F1|2008}}, as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors' Championship in every season between {{F1|1989}} and {{F1|1997}}, and winning every race but one (the [[1996 Monaco Grand Prix]]) between {{F1|1988}} and {{F1|1997}}. Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically, thus increasing financial burdens. This, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive but to stay in business. This effectively forced several teams to withdraw.\n\n===Manufacturers' return===\n[[File:Michael Schumacher 2001 Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Schumacher]] (pictured here in [[2001 Formula One World Championship|2001]]) won five consecutive titles with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].]] Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships (2000\u20132004) and six consecutive Constructors' Championships (1999\u20132004).

From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. This approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/features/2016/3/deciding-the-grid-a-history-of-f1-qualifying-formats.html|title=Deciding the grid \u2013 A history of F1 qualifying formats|website=Formula 1\u00ae \u2013 The Official F1\u00ae Website|access-date=20 May 2021|archive-date=30 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200830180030/https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/features/2016/3/deciding-the-grid-a-history-of-f1-qualifying-formats.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGrids were generally limited to 26 cars \u2013 if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a [[Pre-qualification (Formula One)|pre-qualifying]] session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\n\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.<ref name=Qual>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Practice and qualifying|url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Practice_qualifying_and_race_start_procedure.html|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|access-date=3 January 2016|archive-date=1 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501104833/http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Practice_qualifying_and_race_start_procedure.html|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nCurrently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than [[107% rule|107%]] of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity, the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.<ref name=Qual />\n\nEach car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3.

This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve (Sauber) qualifying at US Grand Prix 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques Villeneuve]] qualifying at the [[2005 United States Grand Prix]] in his [[Sauber C24]]]]\n\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Baxter-Priest |first=Matthew |date=March 2, 2023 |title=What is the car at the back of the F1 grid? {{!}} Esquire Middle East \u2013 The Region's Best Men's Magazine |url=https://www.esquireme.com/sports/what-is-the-car-at-the-back-of-the-f1-grid |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231103153821/https://www.esquireme.com/sports/what-is-the-car-at-the-back-of-the-f1-grid |archive-date=November 3, 2023 |access-date=November 3, 2023 |website=Esquire Middle East \u2013 The Region\u2019s Best Men\u2019s Magazine}}</ref> a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position, signalled by raising their arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the {{F1|2019}} season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8691/ |title=F1 race starting regulations |publisher=Formula One |access-date=16 October 2010 |archive-date=4 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704181035/http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8691/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race. When a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating it, [[List of red-flagged Formula One races|the red flag is deployed]]; since 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane (before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown).\n\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The maximum race length was reduced to {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1966 and {{convert|325|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1971. The race length was standardised to the current {{convert|305|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1989. However, street races like [[Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] have shorter distances, to keep under the two-hour limit.\n\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a backmarker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag<ref>{{cite web|title=Flags |publisher=Formula One |date=21 June 2003 |url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |access-date=3 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702120809/http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |archive-date=2 July 2008 }}</ref> telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\" and, once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to complete more than 90% of the race distance is shown as \"not classified\" in the results.\n\nThroughout the race, drivers may make [[pit stop]]s to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have [[Formula One tyres#Tyre summary|different colours on their sidewalls]]; this allows spectators to understand the strategies. \n\nUnder wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one \"intermediate\", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one \"full wet\", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres.\n\n====Race director====\nThis role involves generally managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in [[parc ferm\u00e9]] before a race, enforcing FIA rules, and controlling the lights which start each race. As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in sorting disputes among teams and drivers. Penalties, such as drive-through penalties (and stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications, and fines can all be handed out should parties break regulations. As of 2023, the race director is [[Niels Wittich]], with [[Herbie Blash]] as a permanent advisor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://the-race.com/formula-1/fia-abandons-rotation-of-f1-race-director-for-rest-of-2022/|title=FIA abandons rotation of F1 race director for rest of 2022|website=The-race.com|date=21 October 2022|access-date=21 October 2022}}</ref>\n\n====Safety car====\n[[File:Formula 1 Safety Car Mercedes-AMG GT R.jpg|thumb|The [[Mercedes-AMG GT|Mercedes-AMG GT R]] safety car at the [[2019 Hungarian Grand Prix]]]]In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside [[Motorsport marshal|race marshals]], race officials may choose to deploy the [[safety car]]. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted. Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a \"rolling start\". Pit stops are permitted under the safety car. Since 2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver [[Bernd Mayl\u00e4nder]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/2713/new-safety-car-driver-announced/|title=New safety car driver announced|publisher=GPUpdate.net|date=8 March 2000|access-date=30 January 2011|archive-date=29 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529171909/http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/2713/new-safety-car-driver-announced/|url-status=live}}</ref> On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line.

The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in their teammate's car should theirs develop a problem \u2013 in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations. \n\nSince the 2010 season, refuelling \u2013 which was reintroduced in 1994 \u2013 has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.\n\n===Points system===\n{{Main|List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n!7th\n!8th\n!9th\n!10th\n!{{tooltip|FL|Fastest lap}}*\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#ffffbf\"|25\n|style=\"background-color:#dfdfdf\"|18\n|style=\"background-color:#ffdf9f\"|15\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|12\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|10\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|8\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|6\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|4\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|2\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|1\n|1\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>A driver must finish within the top ten to receive a point for setting the fastest lap of the race.

This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the [[IndyCar Series]] which allows teams to purchase chassis, and \"[[spec racing|spec series]]\" such as [[FIA Formula 2 Championship|Formula 2]] which require all cars be kept to an identical specification. It also effectively prohibits [[Privateer (motorsport)|privateers]], which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.\n\nThe sport's debut season, {{F1|1950}}, saw eighteen teams compete, but due to high costs, many dropped out quickly.

In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive.

The ''[[pit stop|pit lane]]'', where the drivers stop for tyres, aerodynamic adjustments and minor repairs (such as changing the car's nose due to front wing damage) during the race, retirements from the race, and where the teams work on the cars before the race, is normally located next to the starting grid. The layout of the rest of the circuit varies widely, although in most cases the circuit runs in a clockwise direction. Those few circuits that run anticlockwise (and therefore have predominantly left-handed corners) can cause drivers neck problems due to the enormous lateral forces generated by F1 cars pulling their heads in the opposite direction to normal. A single race requires hotel rooms to accommodate at least 5,000 visitors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/18/stories/2007091857031900.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031234624/http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/18/stories/2007091857031900.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 October 2007 |title=Sport : F-1 race at Sohna or Greater Noida |date=18 September 2007 |access-date=16 October 2010 |work=[[The Hindu]] |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\nMost of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition. The current street circuits are [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]], [[Albert Park Circuit|Melbourne]], [[Marina Bay Street Circuit|Singapore]], [[Baku City Circuit|Baku]], [[Miami International Autodrome|Miami]] and [[Jeddah Corniche Circuit|Jeddah]] although races in other urban locations come and go ([[Las Vegas Grand Prix|Las Vegas]] and [[Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit]], for example) and proposals for such races are often discussed \u2013 most recently [[Las Vegas Grand Prix|Las Vegas]]. The glamour and history of the Monaco race are the primary reasons why the circuit is still in use, even though it does not meet the strict safety requirements imposed on other tracks. Three-time World champion [[Nelson Piquet]] famously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/2011/05/24/monaco-challenge-remains-unique |title=Monaco challenge remains unique \u2013 Formula 1 |publisher=Motor Sport Magazine |date=24 May 2011 |access-date=12 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the [[Bahrain International Circuit]], added in {{F1|2004}} and designed \u2013 like most of F1's new circuits \u2013 by [[Hermann Tilke]]. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] and Imola. His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.\n\nThe [[Circuit of the Americas]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the [[Sochi Autodrom]] in [[Sochi]] and the [[Baku City Circuit]] in [[Azerbaijan]] have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020, [[Algarve International Circuit]] debuted on the F1 calendar as the venue of the [[Portuguese Grand Prix]], with the country having last hosted a race in 1996.{{Efn|name=POR-COVID}} In 2021, [[Circuit Zandvoort]] returned to the F1 calendar as the [[Dutch Grand Prix]], having last hosted a race in 1985.\n\n==Cars and technology==\n{{Main|Formula One car|Formula One engines|Formula One tyres}}\n[[File:Button Spain 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Jenson Button]] in the [[Brawn BGP 001]]]]\nModern Formula One cars are [[mid-engine design|mid-engined]], hybrid, semi-open cockpit, [[open-wheel car|open-wheel]] single-seaters. The [[chassis]] is made largely of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon-fibre composites]], rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong.

This is provided by \"wings\" mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance. The previous generation of cars sported a large number of small winglets, \"barge boards\", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.\n\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the [[tire|tyres]]. From {{F1|1998}} to {{F1|2008}}, the tyres in Formula One were not \"[[slick tyre|slicks]]\" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5283.html |title=Tyres |access-date=4 July 2008 |publisher=Formula One |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218202246/http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5283.html |archive-date=18 December 2008 }}</ref> Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the {{F1|2009}} season.

These provide a very high level of braking performance and are usually the element that provokes the greatest reaction from drivers new to the formula.\n\nIn {{F1|2022}}, the technical regulations changed considerably in order to reduce the [[turbulence]] (commonly referred to as \"dirty air\") produced by the aerodynamics of the car. This includes a redesigned front and rear wing, larger wheels with a lower tyre profile, wheel covers, small winglets, the banning of barge boards, and the reintroduction of [[Ground effect (cars)|Ground effect]] downforce production. These have been changed to promote racing, meaning cars lose less downforce when following another car.

The host broadcaster either had one feed for all, or two separate feeds \u2013 a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents, while the two-feed approach meant that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.\n\nThe only station that differed from this set up was \"DF1\" (re-branded to \"Premiere\" then to \"Sky Deutschland\") \u2013 a German channel which offers all sessions live and interactive, with features such as the onboard and pit-lane channels.

Other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship, such as the [[Syracuse Grand Prix|Syracuse]] and [[Danish Grand Prix|Danish]] Grands Prix, although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid.<ref name=\"LastnonchampF1\" /> These became less common through the 1970s and 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the [[1983 Race of Champions]] at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]] in a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American [[Danny Sullivan]].<ref name=\"LastnonchampF1\" />\n\n===South African Formula One championship===\n{{Main|South African Formula One Championship}}\n\nSouth Africa's flourishing domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975.
