Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round. Berry left the team following a disappointing 1989 season, and his replacement [[Rod Rust]] only lasted one season, 1990, during which the Patriots went 1\u201315. During the late 1980s and early 1990s they changed ownership several times, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by [[Victor Kiam]] in 1988, who sold the team to [[James Orthwein]] in 1992. Though Orthwein's period as owner was short and controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team, first with the hiring of former [[New York Giants]] coach [[Bill Parcells]] in 1993. Orthwein and his marketing team then defied Patriots fans' overwhelming preference and commissioned the NFL to develop a new visual identity and logo, and changed their primary colors from the traditional red, white and blue to blue and silver for the team uniforms.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/20/sports/sp-plaschke20 |first=Bill |last=Plaschke |author-link=Bill Plaschke |title=For this dandy doodle, designer was more like a 30-minute man |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 20, 2008 |access-date=January 21, 2015 |archive-date=January 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120184550/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/20/sports/sp-plaschke20 |url-status=live }}</ref> Orthwein intended to move the team to his native [[St. Louis]] (where it would have been renamed as the [[St. Louis Stallions]]), but instead sold the team in 1994 for $175{{nbsp}}million to Boston paper magnate [[Robert Kraft]], who had bought the Patriots' then-home, [[Foxboro Stadium]], out of bankruptcy in 1988.<ref name=\"PatsHistory1990s\">{{cite web|title=HISTORY: 1990 \u2013 1999|url=https://www.patriots.com/press-room/history-1990s|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Patriots.com|access-date=August 16, 2021|url-status=live|archive-date=August 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816222003/https://www.patriots.com/press-room/history-1990s}}</ref>\n\nContinuing on as head coach under Kraft's ownership, Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including [[Super Bowl XXXI]] (following the [[1996 New England Patriots season|1996 season]]), which they lost to the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] by a score of 35\u201321.

The teams met three times in four years (2003, 2004, 2006) in the playoffs, with the winner going on to win that season's [[Super Bowl]] each time.

The Brady\u2013Manning portion of the rivalry began on September 30, 2001, as Brady made his first NFL start in a 44\u201313 Patriots win at Foxboro; on October 21 the Patriots defeated the Colts at the [[RCA Dome]] 38\u201317.<ref name=\"Pats vs Colts Boxscores\"/>\n\nAfter the Colts left the AFC East in 2002, they first met on November 30, 2003, in a 38\u201334 Patriots win decided on a last-second goal line stand by the Patriots.<ref name=\"Pats vs Colts Boxscores\"/> The Colts broke a six-game Patriot winning streak in the rivalry in November 2005,<ref name=\"Pats vs Colts Boxscores\"/> then won twice in 2006;<ref name=\"Pats vs Colts Boxscores\"/> in the [[AFC Championship Game]] the Colts erased a 21\u20136 halftime lead; the game lead tied or changed seven times in the second half before a late touchdown led to a 38\u201334 Colts win.

On the field, the Patriots have typically used an \"[[Ron Erhardt|Erhardt]]\u2013[[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Perkins]]\" offense and a \"[[Chuck Fairbanks|Fairbanks]]\u2013[[Hank Bullough|Bullough]]\" [[3\u20134 defense]], referred to commonly as a two-gap 3\u20134 defensive system. Under Erhardt's, Perkin's and Bullough's stints as coordinators and head coaches across the league after developing the scheme in collaboration with head coach Chuck Fairbanks, the systems developed in New England in the 1970s would begin to see historic use. Influence spread, especially under their coaching tree in [[Bill Parcells]]' schemes as head coach of the [[New York Giants]] in the mid-to-late 1980s, after serving as a linebacker coach for the Patriots in 1980.  Parcells would come back to New England as head coach in 1993 and re-install the system used in the 1970s and 1980s, re-uniting with Ray Perkins as WR coach. Parcells own coaching tree would use the scheme created in New England as well, especially Belichick, once he was named as head coach after years of being an assistant to Parcells with the New York Giants, the Patriots, and the [[New York Jets]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/packages/nfl2000/plays.htm

[[List of Super Bowl champions|Super Bowls]], the [[History of the National Football League championship|league championship]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]]. The franchise is tied for the most all-time with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. The team repeated as champions between the [[2003 NFL Season|2003]] and [[2004 NFL Season|2004]] NFL seasons, the last club to do so among the seven franchises who have accomplished it ([[Green Bay Packers]], [[Miami Dolphins]], Pittsburgh Steelers (twice), [[San Francisco 49ers]], [[Dallas Cowboys]], and the [[Denver Broncos]]). Between [[2001 NFL season|2001]] and [[2004 NFL season|2004]], the Patriots became the second team in NFL history (after the Dallas Cowboys) to win three Super Bowls in four years (2001, [[2003 NFL season|2003]], 2004), and are also the last franchise to have achieved it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Super Bowls |publisher=New England Patriots |date=2022 |url=https://www.patriots.com/press-room/super-bowls |access-date=2022-08-14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Malcolm Butler (American football).JPG|thumbnail|150px|A Super Bowl hero, CB [[Malcolm Butler]] made one of the greatest plays in NFL history with a game-clinching [[Butler interception|interception]] at the goal line in [[Super Bowl XLIX]], ensuring the Patriots' victory in the final seconds of the game.]]\n[[File:James White (running back).JPG|thumbnail|150px|RB [[James White (running back)|James White]] tallied one of the most impressive Super Bowl performances of all time in [[Super Bowl LI]], with 139 yards from scrimmage (29 rushing, 110 receiving), as well as holding multiple [[List of Super Bowl records|Super Bowl records]] such as most receptions, most receiving yards by a running back, and most points scored in regulation and overtime (20, and 6).]]\n[[File:Dont'a Hightower Patriots.jpg|thumbnail|150px|LB [[Dont'a Hightower]] had two memorable plays in two of the Patriots' Super Bowl wins that were pivotal to the eventual victories.

The Seahawks would throw the game-losing interception to Butler the next play, sealing the Patriots' fourth Super Bowl win.

During Sullivan's [[List of New England Patriots seasons|28 seasons]] of owning the club, the Patriots tallied 14 winning records, made six playoff appearances, played in the 1963 AFL Championship Game and represented the AFC in [[Super Bowl XX]]. However, he was also notoriously cheap, and would cause friction with some his high-profile players who were seeking to be respected and paid what they were worth, causing someone such as future Pro Football Hall of Famer [[Mike Haynes (cornerback)|Mike Haynes]] to seek an owner who was team first.<ref name=\"Obituary2\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E3D9143EF937A15751C0A96E958260 Billy Sullivan, 86,[sic] Founder Of Football Patriots, Dies] New York Times.

In 1990, [[Lisa Olson]], a ''Boston Herald'' reporter, sued Kiam and the Patriots when [[Zeke Mowatt]] allegedly exposed himself and made lewd comments to her in the team change room. The incident stirred debate over female reporters in the locker room. Kiam became the center of the controversy when he came to the defense of the players' actions.<ref name=\"People magazine, Oct. 15, 1990\">{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113326,00.html|title=Sportswriter Lisa Olson Calls the New England Patriots Out of Bounds for Sexual Harassment|date = October 15, 1990| last=Kunen| first= James S. |work=[[People (magazine)|People]]| access-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn his later career, Kiam's business interests moved on from the Patriots, so he sold them in 1992 to [[St. Louis]] businessman [[James Orthwein]]. During his ownership, Orthwein hired [[Bill Parcells]] as head coach and oversaw the drafting of first-overall draft pick quarterback [[Drew Bledsoe]], who helped to return the moribund franchise to respectability. He planned to relocate the Patriots franchise to St. Louis, renaming the team the [[St. Louis Stallions]]. However, those plans were derailed when Boston paper magnate [[Robert Kraft]], owner of [[Foxboro Stadium]], refused to accept a buyout of the lease. Kraft used his ownership of the stadium to stage a [[hostile takeover]], offering to pay $175 million for the Patriots franchise knowing that Orthwein no longer wanted the team if he could not move it to St. Louis. Although future [[Los Angeles Rams|St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams]] owner [[Stan Kroenke]] offered to buy the team for $200 million and move it to St. Louis, Orthwein would have been saddled with all moving expenses. He also would have been responsible for any legal expenses as well, and Kraft had already made it clear that he would go to court to enforce the lease. With no other choice, Orthwein accepted Kraft's bid on January 21, 1994.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last1=McG. Thomas Jr.|first1=Robert|title=Sold!

[[Bill Belichick]] has the longest tenure as head coach (23 seasons) with the Patriots, and has been coach since [[2000 New England Patriots season|2000]]. He has been widely considered one of the greatest coaches of all time, and was named a member of the [[National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team|NFL 100th All-Time Anniversary Team]], due to his numerous accomplishments with the Patriots. He has specifically led the Patriots to 17 [[AFC East]] division titles, 13 appearances in the [[AFC Championship Game]], and nine Super Bowl appearances, with a record six wins.\n\nBelichick is the NFL's longest-tenured active head coach, as well as the first all-time in [[List of National Football League head coaches by playoff record|playoff coaching wins]] with 31 and third in [[List of National Football League head coaches with 50 wins|regular season coaching wins in the NFL]] with 297.<ref>{{Cite news |date=November 19, 2017 |title=Bill Belichick Passes Tom Landry On NFL's All-Time Wins List |publisher=CBS Boston |url=https://boston.cbslocal.com/2017/11/19/patriots-bill-belichick-tom-landry-nfl-all-time-wins-list/ |access-date=November 22, 2017}}</ref> He is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reiss |first=Mike |date=February 4, 2019 |title=Bill Belichick joins George Halas, Curly Lambeau with six NFL titles |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25923676 |access-date=2019-02-13 |publisher=ESPN}}</ref> He was named the [[Associated Press|AP]] [[National Football League Coach of the Year Award|NFL Coach of the Year]] for the [[2003 NFL season|2003]], [[2007 NFL season|2007]], and [[2010 NFL season|2010 seasons]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/coaches.htm |title=New England Patriots Coaches |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |access-date=February 8, 2019 |archive-date=February 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209123923/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/coaches.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Belichick has led the team for more regular season games (336), post-season games (42) and more complete seasons (23) than any other head coach.  His 262 wins with the Patriots are far and away the most in franchise history, more than three times those of runner-up [[Mike Holovak]].\n\nBelichick was acquired in a \"trade\" with the rival [[New York Jets]]. Belichick did not want to be under [[Bill Parcells]]' authority there in 2000, with uncertainty of his role once their owner, [[Leon Hess]], died. The initial promise was that Belichick would've been granted extreme authority over all of the Jets executive decisions, but when Hess passed away Parcells overruled the stipulation with loopholes, so he would remain in control as general manager, leading to Belichick's infamous resignation in 2000. Parcells, a two winning Super Bowl champion coach with the [[New York Giants]] (also was an assistant with the Patriots in the early 1980s), had joined New England's staff for the 1993 season to help resurrect the franchise from its dark early 1990s days but had conflicted interests with owner Robert Kraft.<ref>{{cite web |title=Inside Bill Belichick's resignation as the Jets' coach 20 years ago |publisher=ESPN |work= Rich Cimini |date=2020-01-01 |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28388772/inside-bill-belichick-resignation-jets-coach-20-years-ago |access-date=2022-08-13}}</ref> In his last year with the Patriots in 1996, Parcells brought in his assistant head coach from his Giants days, Belichick, after being dismissed from coaching five seasons with the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Here, Kraft would plant the seeds of a bond between him and Belichick, as Belichick would often mediate issues between Kraft and Parcells. Although Belichick left in 1997 to once again be Parcells assistant in their Jets regime, cold feet about his long-term role there brought him back after negotiating with Kraft, even though he was still under contract with the Jets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Belichick: Resigning from New York Jets was 'one of the great moments of my career' |publisher=USA TODAY |work=Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz |date=2020-11-10 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2020/11/10/bill-belichick-jets-resign-patriots-coach/6241124002/ |access-date=2022-08-13}}</ref> The Patriots had technically \"tampered\" in communicating with Belichick. For compensation, the Patriots gave the Jets their first round pick in the [[2000 NFL draft]], where even without their first round pick, the Patriots would coincidentally draft [[Tom Brady]] in the sixth round, widely regarded as the greatest quarterback of all time and the NFL's greatest draft steal.\n\nWhile Belichick led the team to nine of their eleven [[Super Bowl]] appearances, winning six of them, before him the Patriots saw some championship game appearances.  Holovak, [[Raymond Berry]] and Parcells all led the Patriots to league championship games, with only one coach failing to reach the Super Bowl.  Five Patriots head coaches, Holovak, [[Chuck Fairbanks]], Berry, Parcells, and Belichick, have been named [[National Football League Coach of the Year Award|coach of the year]] by at least one major news organization.  The first head coach in franchise history was [[Lou Saban]], who coached them to a 7\u201312\u20130 record in the [[1960 Boston Patriots season|1960]] season. \n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:140px;\"|Name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Tenure\n!colspan=\"3\"|Record\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Titles\n|-\n!W!!L!!T\n|-\n|align=left | [[Lou Saban]]\n|align=left|[[1960 Boston Patriots season|1960]]\u2013[[1961 Boston Patriots season|1961]]\n|7||12||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Mike Holovak]]\n|align=left|[[1961 Boston Patriots season|1961]]\u2013[[1968 Boston Patriots season|1968]]\n|52||49||9\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Clive Rush]]\n|align=left|[[1969 Boston Patriots season|1969]]\u2013[[1970 Boston Patriots season|1970]]\n|5||16||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[John Mazur]]\n|align=left|[[1971 New England Patriots season|1971]]\u2013[[1972 New England Patriots season|1972]]\n|9||21||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Phil Bengtson]]*\n|align=left|[[1972 New England Patriots season|1972]]\n|1||4||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Chuck Fairbanks]]\n|align=left|[[1973 New England Patriots season|1973]]\u2013[[1978 New England Patriots season|1978]]\n|46||39||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Ron Erhardt]]\n|align=left|[[1979 New England Patriots season|1979]]\u2013[[1981 New England Patriots season|1981]]\n|21||28||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Ron Meyer]]\n|align=left|[[1982 New England Patriots season|1982]]\u2013[[1984 New England Patriots season|1984]]\n|18||15||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Raymond Berry]]\n|align=left|[[1984 New England Patriots season|1984]]\u2013[[1989 New England Patriots season|1989]]\n|48||39||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Rod Rust]]\n|align=left|[[1990 New England Patriots season|1990]]\n|1||15||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Dick MacPherson]]\n|align=left|[[1991 New England Patriots season|1991]]\u2013[[1992 New England Patriots season|1992]]\n|8||24||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Bill Parcells]]\n|align=left|[[1993 New England Patriots season|1993]]\u2013[[1996 New England Patriots season|1996]]\n|32||32||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Pete Carroll]]\n|align=left|[[1997 New England Patriots season|1997]]\u2013[[1999 New England Patriots season|1999]]\n|27||21||0\n|\n|-\n|align=left | [[Bill Belichick]]\n|align=left|[[2000 New England Patriots season|2000]]\u2013present\n|262||108||0\n|6\n|}\n'''Note''':\n* <sup>*</sup> = Interim coach\n\n{{New England Patriots staff}}\n\n===Offensive coordinator history===\nSource:<ref name=\"AllTimePatriotsCoaches\">{{cite web|title=All-Time Assistant Coaches|url=https://patriots.1rmg.com/seasons/|date=September 12, 2021|access-date=July 19, 2022|archive-date=July 19, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220719063039/https://patriots.1rmg.com/seasons/|url-status=bot: unknown}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};\"|Years !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};\"|Name\n|-\n| 2023\u2013present || Bill O'Brien\n|-\n| 2012\u20132021 || Josh McDaniels\n|-\n| 2011 || [[Bill O'Brien (American football)|Bill O'Brien]]\n|-\n| 2006\u20132008 || [[Josh McDaniels]]\n|-\n| 2000\u20132004 || [[Charlie Weis]]\n|-\n| 1998\u20131999 || [[Ernie Zampese]]\n|-\n| 1997 || [[Larry Kennan]]\n|-\n| 1993\u20131996 || [[Ray Perkins]]\n|-\n| 1991\u20131992 || [[Dick Coury]]\n|-\n| 1990 || [[Jimmy Raye II]]\n|-\n| 1982\u20131984 || [[Lew Erber]]\n|-\n| 1977\u20131978 || [[Ron Erhardt]]\n|-\n| 1973\u20131976 || [[Red Miller]]\n|}\n\n===Defensive coordinator history===\nSource:<ref name=\"AllTimePatriotsCoaches\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};\"|Years !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|border=2}};\"|Name\n|-\n| 2012\u20132017 || [[Matt Patricia]]\n|-\n| 2006\u20132009 || [[Dean Pees]]\n|-\n| 2005 || [[Eric Mangini]]\n|-\n| 2001\u20132004 || [[Romeo Crennel]]\n|-\n| 1997\u20131999 || [[Steve Sidwell (American football)|Steve Sidwell]]\n|-\n| 1993\u20131996 || [[Al Groh]]\n|-\n| 1991\u20131992 || [[Joe Collier]]\n|-\n| 1990 || [[Charlie Sumner]]\n|-\n| 1983\u20131987 || [[Rod Rust]]\n|-\n| 1982 || [[Jim E.
