The Rangers compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League West|West Division]]. They are one of two major league clubs based in Texas, alongside the [[Houston Astros]] of the same league. The team was founded as the [[Washington Senators (1960-1971)|Washington Senators]] in 1961, an [[expansion team]] awarded to [[Washington, D.C.]], after [[Washington Senators (1901\u20131960)|its previous team]] became the [[Minnesota Twins]]. The new Senators relocated to [[Arlington, Texas]] after the {{MLBy|1971}} season and debuted as the Rangers the following spring. In 2020, the Rangers moved to the new [[Globe Life Field]] after having played at Globe Life Park (now [[Choctaw Stadium]]) from 1994 to 2019. The team's name is derived from a historic [[Texas Ranger Division|law enforcement agency]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=T.R.|title=How they came to be called the Rangers|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/texas-rangers-team-name-origin|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=[[MLB.com|TexasRangers.com]]|date=December 1, 2021|access-date=November 1, 2023}}</ref>\n\nThe Rangers have made nine appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team in both 2012 and 2023. Prior to 2010, the Rangers were the only team in MLB to have never advanced past the first round of the playoffs. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, defeating the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. The team then won their [[2010 American League Championship Series|first American League pennant]] after beating the [[New York Yankees]] in six games; league MVP [[Josh Hamilton]] won their first ALCS MVP award for a Ranger player. In their first appearance in a [[2010 World Series|World Series]], the Rangers fell to the [[2010 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in five games. They repeated as American League champions the following year, but lost the [[2011 World Series]] to the [[2011 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games. The Rangers made it to the [[2023 World Series]] and won their first-ever championship, defeating the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in five games, with [[Corey Seager]] being the first Ranger player to win the [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award]].\n\nFrom 1961 through the end of 2024, the franchise's overall win\u2013loss record is {{Win\u2013loss record|w=4,818|l=5,302|t=6}} ({{winpct|4818|5302|6}}).

National League|exemption]] from the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. As part of the expansion, the American League added two expansion teams for the {{mlby|1961}} season\u2013the [[1961 Los Angeles Angels season|Los Angeles Angels]] and a new Washington Senators team.<!-- However, the new Senators were (and still are) considered an expansion team since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history.--> The new Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an [[1960 MLB Expansion Draft|expansion draft]]. The team played their [[1961 Washington Senators season|inaugural season]] at old [[Griffith Stadium]], then moved to the new [[District of Columbia Stadium]] in [[1962 Washington Senators season|1962]] under a ten-year lease.\n\n[[File:Richard Nixon throwing out opening pitch at Senators game, 1969.jpg|thumb|300px|right|U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] throwing the [[Opening Day]] [[ceremonial first pitch]] at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] on April 7, [[1969 Washington Senators season|1969]], with [[Ted Williams]] (left) and [[Bob Short]] (right, partially obscured by [[Ralph Houk]])]]\nFor most of their existence, the new Senators epitomized futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators: \"Washington: [[Henry Lee III#Post-war career|first in war, first in peace]] and ''still'' last in the American League.\" [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], an [[outfielder]]/[[first baseman]] from 1965 to 1972 known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles.\n\nThe concurrent rise of the nearby [[Baltimore Orioles]] to regular championship contenders (winning their first World Series in {{wsy|1966}}) certainly did not help the Senators draw crowds. Further expansion and re-alignment in 1969 did not do much to help the Senators either, since (unlike the [[National League (baseball)|National League]]) the AL owners elected to align their new divisions strictly based on geography. This arrangement placed both expansion teams (the [[Seattle Pilots]] and the [[Kansas City Royals]]) in the [[AL West]], while pitting last place Washington against the AL's five best teams in the [[AL East]]. Despite this, the Senators managed a winning season in [[1969 Washington Senators season|1969]] (their only winning record in the nation's capital) when [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Ted Williams]] managed the club to an 86\u201376 finish, good enough for fourth in the AL East.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1969 Washington Senators Statistics |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/WSA/1969.shtml |access-date=June 1, 2022 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref> \n\nOwnership changed hands several times during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision-making and planning. Following their brief success in 1969, owner [[Bob Short]] was forced to make many questionable trades to lower the debt he had incurred to pay for the team in late 1968; the purchase price was reported at $9.4&nbsp;million.<ref name=shbuynats>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=abVWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cekDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7359%2C1813874 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=R.E.

Years earlier, [[Charles O. Finley]], the owner of the [[Kansas City Athletics]], sought to relocate his baseball team to Dallas, but the idea was rebuffed and ultimately declined by the other AL team owners (the A's ultimately moved to [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland, California in 1968]]). Arlington's [[hole card]] was [[Turnpike Stadium]], a 10,000-seat park built in 1965 to house the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Spurs]] of the [[Texas League]]. However, it had been built to MLB specifications, and only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate major league crowds.\n\nVandergriff's offer of a multimillion-dollar down payment prompted Short to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, [[1971 Washington Senators season|1971]], American League owners voted 10\u20132 to allow the move of the franchise to Arlington for the [[1972 Texas Rangers season|1972 season]].<ref name=lwmtdfw>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gB9OAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Qe0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5070%2C2397226 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Owners let Washington move to Dallas\u2013Fort Worth |date=September 22, 1971 |page=16 |access-date=October 4, 2020 |archive-date=January 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102185710/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gB9OAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Qe0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5070%2C2397226 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Minot|first=George Jr.|title=Short Takes Senators to Texas|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 22, 1971}}</ref> Senators fans were livid, and enmity came to a head at the club's last game in Washington on Thursday, September&nbsp;30.

The team played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1\u20130 loss at the hands of the [[California Angels]], their 1961 expansion cousins. The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels, 5\u20131, for the club's first victory.\n\nIn 1974, the Rangers experienced their first winning season after finishing last in both 1972 and 1973. Under the ownership of [[Brad Corbett]], they finished second in the American League West with an 84\u201376 record, behind the eventual [[World Series]] champion [[Oakland Athletics]]. The [[1974 Texas Rangers season|1974 Rangers]] are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 100-loss seasons. [[Mike Hargrove]] was awarded [[American League Rookie of the Year]], [[Billy Martin]] was named [[AL Manager of the Year]], [[Jeff Burroughs]] won [[AL MVP]], and [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was named the [[Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year]] after winning 25 games, a club record to this day. The team posted winning records again from 1977 to 1979 but fell short of reaching the playoffs. The Rangers came very close to clinching a playoff spot in 1981, but wound up losing the first half of the AL West by one-and-a-half games to Oakland at the time of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. Texas went on to finish under .500 each season through 1985.\n\nThe Rangers faced an attendance problem for a few years in Texas, due in part to both the team's inconsistent performance and the oppressive heat and humidity that can encompass the area in the summer. Until the [[Florida Marlins]] arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the majors, with temperatures frequently topping {{convert|100|F|C}} throughout the summer. So the Rangers began playing most of their weekend games between May and September at night, a tradition that continued for years.\n\n====Valentine, Ryan, and Bush (1985\u20131994)====\n[[File:President George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Joe Morgan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|President [[George H. W. Bush]] with son, [[George W.

Bush (''far right'') owned the Rangers from 1989 to 1994]]\nManager [[Bobby Valentine]] became steward over an influx of talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of stellar young rookies such as [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]], [[Pete Incaviglia]], [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]], [[Bobby Witt]], and [[Edwin Correa]], the Rangers finished the season in second place with an 87\u201375 record, just five games behind the division champion Angels. The season marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in yet another last place finish in the West.\n[[File:Nolan Ryan Tiger Stadium 1990 CROP.jpg|left|thumb|[[Nolan Ryan]], Rangers pitcher from 1989 to 1993]]\nThe signing of 41-year-old star pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] prior to the 1989 season allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th [[strikeout]], 300th [[Win (baseball)|win]], and 6th and 7th [[no-hitter]]s with the Rangers. Despite powerful lineups including [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], Rub\u00e9n Sierra, [[Julio Franco]], and [[Rafael Palmeiro]] and a pitching staff that also included [[Charlie Hough]], Bobby Witt, [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], and [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]], Valentine's Rangers never finished above second place and he was relieved of his duties during the 1992 season.\n\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon [[Eddie Chiles]], sold the team to an investment group headed by [[George W. Bush]] for $89&nbsp;million.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-08-27-sp-855-story.html Los Angeles Times: \"Chiles Reaches Agreement on Sale of Rangers\"]  August 27, 1988</ref> While his own equity in the team was a small one ($500,000), Bush was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group.

Bush went on to be elected [[President of the United States]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]].\n\nDuring Bush's tenure, the Rangers and the City of Arlington decided to replace the aging Arlington Stadium with a new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193&nbsp;million, financed by Arlington residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 1991, on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named [[Choctaw Stadium]]).\n\nIn 1993, [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]] took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into mid-September; Nolan Ryan also retired after that season. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the AL West prior to the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]] which prompted commissioner [[Bud Selig]] to cancel the remainder of the season and the playoffs. On July 28, Kenny Rogers pitched the 12th [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in major league history in Arlington against the California Angels.\n\n====First division titles (1995\u20132000)====\n[[File:Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.jpg|thumb|left|[[Globe Life Park]] opened in 1994.]]\n\n[[Johnny Oates]] was hired as the Rangers' manager in 1995. Oates and company helped to bring home the 1996 AL Western Division Championship, the first division championship in franchise history. The first playoff series, 24 years after the franchise came to Texas, saw the Rangers lose to the New York Yankees, 3 games to 1. Oates was named AL Manager of the Year and [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]] was named AL MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters including Gonz\u00e1lez, [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]], and [[Rusty Greer]], but continued to struggle with pitching despite having [[Rick Helling]] and [[Aaron Sele]] on their roster. Oates led the team to consecutive AL West championships in 1998 and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, losing all six in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team that won three World Series in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams in the first round. The 1999 team was to be the last playoff-bound team until 2010. En route to a second-straight last-place finish, Oates resigned his position 28&nbsp;games into the 2001 season.\n\nIn 1998, venture capital billionaire [[Tom Hicks]] bought the team for $250&nbsp;million.<ref name=test>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html George W.

The move was controversial and is frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought that owner Tom Hicks was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle, and manager [[Jerry Narron]] was fired following the 2002 season and was replaced by seasoned manager [[Buck Showalter]]. The 2003 season signified the Rangers' fourth-straight last-place finish, and after a postseason fallout between Rodriguez and club management, the reigning AL MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]] and infield prospect [[Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1rias (baseball)|Joaquin Arias]].\n\nThe Rangers battled with the [[Anaheim Angels]] and Oakland Athletics for first place in the AL West for much of the 2004 season. [[Mark Teixeira]], Alfonso Soriano, [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], and [[Hank Blalock]] became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, with Young, Blalock, and Soriano being selected for the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2004 All-Star Game]]. Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2 for 3 with a three-run [[home run]]. Despite a late-season push, the Rangers ended up losing six of their final ten games and finished in third place behind the Angels and A's, a mere three games out of first place.\n\n====Making changes (2005\u20132009)====\n[[File:Nelson Cruz.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nelson Cruz]], Rangers outfielder from 2006 to 2013]]\n\nIn 2005, the Rangers again struggled to find consistency amid controversy and injuries. [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] stepped down as general manager following the 2005 season. [[Jon Daniels]] was promoted from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and one month, became the youngest general manager in major league history.\n\nDaniels and the Rangers front office were very active in acquiring new players before and during the 2006 season. New acquisitions included [[Brad Wilkerson]], [[Adam Eaton (pitcher)|Adam Eaton]], [[Kevin Millwood]], [[Carlos Lee]], and [[Nelson Cruz]]. Despite bolstering their roster, the Rangers' 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80\u201382 record and a third-place finish in the AL West. Buck Showalter was dismissed as manager after the season. The team hired Oakland third base coach [[Ron Washington]] as their next manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061105&content_id=1733731|title=Rangers select Washington to manage|first=T.R.|last=Sullivan|work=MLB.com|date=November 6, 2006|access-date=May 30, 2006}}{{dead link|date=October 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A change at manager was the first of several moves to strengthen the team in yet another busy offseason.

A number of roster moves before the 2007 trade deadline were the beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and the Far East. Daniels' objective was to field a legitimately competitive team by the 2010 season.\n[[File:Josh Hamilton.jpg|left|thumb|[[Josh Hamilton]], Rangers outfielder from 2008 to 2012]]\nThe Rangers began the 2008 season exceptionally well, headlined by newcomer [[Josh Hamilton]] who looked to be a threat to win the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], before fading off as the season wore on. During the All-Star festivities at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Hamilton crushed a first-round home run record in the 2008 [[Home Run Derby]] with 28. Hamilton hit another four in the second round and three during the final round, for a total of 35 home runs, but lost to the Twins' [[Justin Morneau]]. Four Rangers played in the All Star Game: Hamilton, [[Ian Kinsler]], [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]], and Michael Young, who would repeat his 2006 All-Star Game feat by driving in the winning run via a sac fly.\n\nThe Rangers finished the season with yet another sub-.500 record (79\u201383), yet ended the season second in the AL West, the club's best finish since 1999. The 2009 season saw the Rangers soar into playoff contention for the first time since 2004. Despite injuries to Josh Hamilton and [[Ian Kinsler]], the Rangers held first place in their division for long stretches of the summer before fading after September 1, losing the division to the Los Angeles Angels. The Rangers finished the season at 87\u201375, their first winning season since 2004 and good enough for second place in the AL West. Michael Young responded to his move to third base by posting one of his best offensive seasons ever while committing just nine errors and earning a sixth-straight All-Star appearance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/stats/_/id/4566/michael-young |title=Michael Young Stats \u2013 Texas Rangers \u2013 ESPN |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=October 19, 1976 |access-date=August 29, 2013 |archive-date=January 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102185732/https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/stats/_/id/4566/michael-young |url-status=live }}</ref> Josh Hamilton and [[Nelson Cruz]] were also named 2009 AL All-Stars.\n\n====Rangers Baseball Express, LLC====\nFollowing financial problems, including defaulting on a $525&nbsp;million loan,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finalternatives.com/node/7478 |title=Tom Hicks' Sports Group Defaults On $525 Million In Loans |publisher=FINalternatives |date=April 3, 2009 |access-date=August 29, 2013 |archive-date=October 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017000931/http://www.finalternatives.com/node/7478 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Tom Hicks]] and Hicks Sports Group reached an agreement to sell the Texas Rangers to group headed by Pittsburgh sports lawyer [[Chuck Greenberg (businessman)|Chuck Greenberg]] and Rangers team president Nolan Ryan for approximately $570&nbsp;million on January 22, 2010.<ref name=\"mlb.mlb.com\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100122&content_id=7958194&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex&partnerId=rss_tex Hicks' sale of Rangers finalized] ''MLB.com''</ref> Hicks also sold much of the land surrounding Rangers Ballpark to Greenberg and Ryan's group in a separate deal.\n\nHowever, one of HSG's principal lenders, Monarch Alternative Capital, opposed the sale on grounds that the proceeds would not fully repay the defaulted HSG notes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4309:brown-time-for-mlb-to-play-hardball-on-the-texas-rangers-sale&catid=26:editorials&Itemid=39 |title=Brown: Time for MLB to Play Hardball on the Texas Rangers Sale |publisher=Bizofbaseball.com |date=April 22, 2010 |access-date=August 29, 2013 |archive-date=February 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224203151/http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4309:brown-time-for-mlb-to-play-hardball-on-the-texas-rangers-sale&catid=26:editorials&Itemid=39 |url-status=live }}</ref> On April 21, Major League Baseball issued a statement declaring the Rangers' sale to be under the control of the Commissioner to expedite the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rangersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/04/mlb-statement-on-rangers-sale.html |title=MLB statement on Rangers sale : Texas Rangers Blog &#124; |work=The Dallas Morning News |publisher=Rangersblog.dallasnews.com |date=April 21, 2010 |access-date=August 29, 2013 |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003152417/http://rangersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/04/mlb-statement-on-rangers-sale.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |url=http://startelegramsports.typepad.com/foul_territory/2010/04/mlb-says-its-in-control-of-sale.html |title=Foul Territory: MLB says it's in control of sale |publisher=Startelegramsports.typepad.com |date=April 21, 2010 |access-date=August 29, 2013 |archive-date=January 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102185834/https://startelegramsports.typepad.com/foul_territory/2010/04/mlb-says-its-in-control-of-sale.html |url-status=live }}</ref> As the stalemate between HSG and its creditors continued, the Texas Rangers filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] on May 24.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2010/05/24/2010-05-24_arod_takes_a_hit_texas_rangers_file_for_bankrupcty_could_cost_yankees_alex_rodri.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=A-Rod takes a hit: Texas Rangers file for bankruptcy, could cost Yankees' Alex Rodriguez $25 million | first1=Bill | last1=Madden | first2=Corky | last2=Siemaszko | date=May 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\">{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2010/05/24/texas-rangers-owe-alex-rodriguez-249-million/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Texas Rangers Owe Alex Rodriguez $24.9 Million | first=Eric | last=Morath | date=May 24, 2010 | access-date=August 4, 2017 | archive-date=January 2, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102185738/https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-BANKB-12524 | url-status=live }}</ref> As of that date, the Rangers and HSG had an estimated debt of $575&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\"/> Much of the unsecured debt was owed in back salary.

Both the home white and road gray uniforms feature \"RangerS\" in red serif rounded letters with blue drop shadows (with a white star at the bottom of the \"R\"), and the back of the uniform featured red block letters for the player names and red block numbers with blue trim. Red, white and blue stripes adorn the collar and sleeves. The original cap is blue with a red brim, and has a white \"T\" trimmed in red emblazoned on it.\n\nIn 1975, the Rangers went with a two-button pullover design and changed the road uniform color to powder blue. The home uniform design remained mostly the same save for the blue trim on the player's name. However, the front of the road uniform was changed to \"TEXAS\" in red letters with white and blue trim, which was also used on the numbers. Player names became dark royal blue. This style was used for one season before the blue trim disappeared and the middle three letters became lowercase in the word \"TexaS\". Also in 1976, a left sleeve patch was added containing the Texas map and red star on a red, white and blue shield with \"RANGERS\" in red letters on top. For 1976 only, the patch featured \"1776\" and \"1976\" in white in commemoration of the [[United States Bicentennial]]. Names would be dropped from the uniform in 1980, but returned the following season, during which the uniforms returned to a traditional buttoned style and a new circular sleeve patch featuring the \"TR\" in red letters in front of a baseball and blue Texas map was added.\n\n===1983\u20131993===\nThis period saw the Rangers deemphasize red in favor of blue on their uniforms. The home white uniform now had \"RANGERS\" in uppercase letters, with the trim on the player names removed. The road uniform color was changed to a dark royal blue, and \"TEXAS\" was also featured in red-trimmed white uppercase letters. The \"TR\" patch minus the circle was moved to the left chest, and a road all-blue cap was unveiled featuring a red \"T\" trimmed in white. This design was used for one season. Then in 1984, the Rangers made slight tweaks to their uniforms, unveiling a red alternate uniform and going with a script \"Rangers\" in front. The sleeve patch, now featuring the script \"Rangers\" in red on a baseball and a blue Texas map, was added, and left chest numbers were also emblazoned.\n\nLate in 1985, the Rangers returned to wearing road gray uniforms. This design has \"TEXAS\" in blue block letters with white trim; the same color scheme was also used on the player's name and number. Both this uniform and the existing home uniform removed the collar and sleeve striping. In addition, the all-blue cap returned after a two-year absence, replacing the original red-brimmed blue cap. Both blue and red alternate uniforms were retired.\n\n===1994\u20132000===\nThe Rangers changed its uniforms in anticipation of moving to The Ballpark in Arlington. Red became the primary color and blue was relegated to accent color, and silver was also added. The home white uniforms featured red piping and \"RANGERS\" in red serif rounded letters with blue trim. That same color scheme was used on the player's name and number. The road gray uniforms featured red sleeve piping and \"TEXAS\" in red serif rounded letters with white trim; the player's name and number also adopted this color scheme. A new red cap was also unveiled, featuring a white \"T\" with a blue drop-shadow. Blue trim was later added on the road uniform letters. Starting in 1996, the Rangers sported a new sleeve patch. This patch is a blue diamond with silver pinstripes, and contained a silver star surrounded by a red circle that featured two baseballs and the full team name in white letters.\n\nFor the 2000 season, the Rangers kept their home uniforms, but the road uniforms were changed anew. Blue again became the dominant color on the road uniform letters, and a new all-blue cap was released, essentially the inverse of the all-red cap. A new blue alternate uniform was also released, featuring white letters with red and blue trim. A [[flag of Texas|Texas flag patch]] adorned the home and road uniforms.\n\n===2001\u20132008===\nStarting in 2001, the Rangers again went with blue as a dominant color, while also adding black as an accent color. Black drop shadows were added on the home and road uniform letters, as were silver accents on the blue alternate uniform. The home uniform brought back the left chest numbers but removed the chest piping, while the Texas flag patch was added on the blue alternate uniform. The Rangers wore three different caps during this period. For both home and road games, the Rangers sported either an all-blue cap or a black-brimmed blue cap with the \"T\" in white and red drop shadows, while for road games only, the all-blue cap with a red \"T\" on a white drop shadow was used.\n\nIn 2004, the Rangers added a white alternate sleeveless uniform, containing the red \"T\" with white trim and blue drop shadows in front, along with blue piping and blue letters with red trim. The chest number was moved to the right. In 2006, the Rangers added a gray road alternate sleeveless uniform, similar to their primary road uniform but with the addition of chest numbers and blue piping, and the absence of black drop shadows. Both sleeveless uniforms were paired with blue undershirts. The red \"T\" all-blue cap which was not worn in 2004 and 2005 was brought back to be worn with the road gray alternates. However, the black-brimmed blue cap was retired permanently.\n\n===2009\u20132019===\nIn 2009, the Rangers unveiled slight updates to their uniform design. The home uniform now featured \"TEXAS\" in blue letters with red and white trim along with black drop shadows. The chest numbers were also removed. In addition, the block letters and numbers added some pointed accents similar to the \"TEXAS\" wordmark. The Rangers also added a red home alternate uniform, which was essentially the inverse of their blue alternate uniform. This uniform also brought back the all-red cap which was last worn in 2000. Starting in 2014, the black drop shadows and silver accents were removed. While blue remained a primary color used on all road games and most home games, the Rangers would occasionally wear red accessories with the home white uniform.\n\n===2020\u2013present===\nAs in 1994, the Rangers changed their uniforms upon moving to a new ballpark, this time in Globe Life Field. The home white uniforms now featured a script \"Rangers\" wordmark in blue with white and red trim, and letters were blue with white trim and red drop shadows. As with the previous white uniform, this set is worn with either blue or red accessories. The road gray, red alternate, and blue alternate uniform remained mostly the same except for the updated letters and the addition of drop shadows. On the red alternate uniform, a blue-brimmed red cap with \"TX\" in front of a red Texas map in front was added as an alternate to the all-red cap. Also new was a powder blue alternate, featuring the \"Rangers\" script in white with royal blue trim and red drop shadows, and is paired with a powder blue cap with royal blue brim emblazoned with a white \"T\" on a red drop shadow. Unlike the other uniforms, the powder blue alternate does not have a corresponding batting helmet; instead, the royal blue batting helmet was used.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=T.R.|title=Rangers unveil 6 new uniforms for 2020|url=https://www.mlb.com/rangers/news/rangers-reveal-new-uniforms-for-2020|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=TexasRangers.com|date=December 4, 2019|access-date=December 5, 2019|archive-date=January 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102185708/https://www.mlb.com/rangers/news/rangers-reveal-new-uniforms-for-2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=Texas Rangers Unveil Uniform Information For 2020|url=https://www.mlb.com/rangers/press-release/press-release-texas-rangers-unveil-uniform-information-for-2020?t=rangers-press-releases|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=TexasRangers.com|date=December 4, 2019|access-date=December 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2023, due to MLB and Nike's new four-uniform plus [[City Connect]] limit, the Rangers' red uniform was retired.

Also that year, the Rangers unveiled their City Connect uniform. The cream and black uniform featured a mythical-like creature titled a Peagle, which represents the metro area's two minor league baseball teams before the arrival of the team, the [[Fort Worth Panthers]] and the [[Dallas Eagles]]. Along with the Peagle, the uniform also features a [[Typography|typographic]] \"TX\" on the hat and across the chest, as this is similar to the uniform of the Eagles.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rangers' City Connect jerseys honor DFW's rich baseball heritage |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/rangers-city-connect-jerseys |access-date=April 17, 2023 |website=MLB.com |language=en}}</ref> The City Connect uniform was met with mixed reception, with most criticism stemming from fans who disliked the uniform's design.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Texas Rangers fans disgusted by team's City Connect outfits: \"Must have had an elementary school contest on designing the uniforms\" |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/baseball/news-texas-rangers-fans-disgusted-team-s-city-connect-outfits-must-elementary-school-contest-designing-uniforms |access-date=April 28, 2023 |website=sportskeeda.com |date=April 17, 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Texas Rangers New City Connect Uniforms are Awful |url=https://sportstalk790.iheart.com/featured/chris-gordy/content/2023-04-18-the-texas-rangers-new-city-connect-uniforms-are-awful/ |access-date=April 28, 2023 |website=sportstalk790.iheart.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Mascot==\n[[File:Rangers Captain team mascot May 23 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Rangers Captain (May 2016)]]\nRangers Captain is the mascot for the Texas Rangers.

A sign just inside the left-field foul line is marked as 334 feet to honor Ryan. The power alleys, at 372 feet in left and 374 feet in right, respectively pay homage to the Rangers' first season in Arlington (1972) and first winning season (1974).<ref>{{cite web
