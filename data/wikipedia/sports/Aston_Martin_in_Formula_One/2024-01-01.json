World Championship|2024]]. The company first participated in Formula One during the [[1959 Formula One season|1959 season]] where they debuted the [[Aston Martin DBR4|DBR4]] chassis using their own engine but it failed to score any points. They continued to perform poorly through the [[1960 Formula One season|1960 season]], once again failing to score any points. As a result, Aston Martin decided to leave Formula One after 1960.\n\nA commercial rebranding of the [[Racing Point F1 Team]] resulted in the team's return as Aston Martin in {{F1|2021}}, utilising customer [[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains|Mercedes]] power units. In {{F1|2026}}, the team will begin using [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] power units as part of a works partnership with the Japanese manufacturer. The team, owned by [[Lawrence Stroll]], has [[Fernando Alonso]] and [[Lance Stroll]] as their race drivers beginning with the [[2023 Formula One World Championship|2023 season]]. The team is headquartered in [[Silverstone]] and has previously raced under various different names, starting with [[Jordan Grand Prix]] in {{F1|1991}}.\n\n==History==\n=== David Brown Corporation (1959\u20131960) ===\n{{See also|David Brown Ltd.}}\nAston Martin first entered Formula One with the [[Aston Martin DBR4|DBR4]], their first open-wheel racing car. The DBR4 was first built and tested in 1957 but did not make its Formula One debut until 1959. This delay was caused by the company prioritising the development of the [[Aston Martin DBR1|DBR1]] sports car, which went on to win the [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. By the DBR4's world championship debut at the [[1959 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch Grand Prix]], it had become outdated and struggled for pace against its competitors, with [[Carroll Shelby]] and [[Roy Salvadori]] qualifying 10th and 13th respectively out of 15.<ref name=\"DBR4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/17/Aston-Martin-DBR4.html|title=Aston Martin DBR4|website=ultimatecarpage.com|date=18 March 2016|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://database.motorsportmagazine.com/database/races/1959-dutch-grand-prix|title=1959 Dutch Grand Prix|website=motorsportmagazine.com|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref> Salvadori retired from the race in the early laps with an engine failure, with Shelby's car suffering the same fate later in the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-1959/55/dutch-grand-prix-a-brm-victory-at-last|title=1959 Dutch Grand Prix race report: Bonnier makes his mark|author=Denis Jenkinson|website=motorsportmagazine.com|date=7 July 2014 |access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Aston Martin DBR4 Mallory Park.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Aston Martin DBR4]] which was driven by [[Roy Salvadori]] and [[Carroll Shelby]].]]\nThe team's next entry came at the [[1959 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] where Salvadori surprised by qualifying in 2nd place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr080.html|title=British GP, 1959|website=grandprix.com|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref> Early in the race, one of Shelby's [[ignition magneto]]s failed, harming his car's pace.
