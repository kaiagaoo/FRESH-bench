Founded in {{mlby|1901}} as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the team's home [[baseball park|ballpark]] has been [[Fenway Park]] since {{mlby|1912}}. The \"Red Sox\" name was chosen by the team owner, [[John I.

In addition, they won the {{mlby|1904}} American League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]], but were not able to defend their [[1903 World Series]] championship when the [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] refused to participate in the [[1904 World Series]].\n\nThe Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league, defeating the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the first [[World Series]] in [[1903 World Series|1903]] and winning four more championships by 1918. However, they then went into one of the longest championship [[List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts|droughts]] in baseball history, dubbed the \"[[Curse of the Bambino]]\" after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox' sale of star player [[Babe Ruth]] to the rival [[New York Yankees]] two years after their World Series championship in 1918. The Sox endured an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Series championship in {{wsy|2004}}. The team's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history, including [[Enos Slaughter]]'s \"[[Slaughter's Mad Dash|mad dash]]\" in {{wsy|1946}}, the \"[[The Impossible Dream (1967)|Impossible Dream]]\" of {{wsy|1967}}, [[Carlton Fisk]]'s home run in {{wsy|1975}}, and [[Bill Buckner]]'s error in {{wsy|1986}}.

''Sox'' had been previously adopted for the [[Chicago White Sox]] by newspapers needing a headline-friendly form of ''Stockings'', as \"Stockings Win!\" in [[Large font|large type]] did not fit in a column.

Managed by [[Harry Wright]], Cincinnati adopted a uniform with white knickers and red stockings and earned the famous nickname, a year or two before hiring the first fully professional team in 1869. When the club folded after the 1870 season, Wright was hired by Boston businessman [[Ivers Whitney Adams]]<ref>From George V. Tuohey (1897). A History of the Boston Baseball Club: A concise and accurate history of Base Ball from its inception. Boston, Massachusetts: M. F. Quinn & Co. p. 64.</ref> to organize a new team in Boston, and he brought three teammates and the \"Red Stockings\" nickname along. (Most nicknames were then unofficial\u2014neither club names nor registered trademarks\u2014so the migration was informal.) The [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] won four championships in the five seasons of the new [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]], the first professional league.\n\nWhen a new Cincinnati club was formed as a charter member of the [[National League (baseball)|National League]] in 1876, the \"Red Stockings\" nickname was commonly reserved for them once again, and the Boston team was referred to as the \"Red Caps\". Other names were sometimes used before Boston officially adopted the nickname \"Braves\" in 1912; the club [[Boston Braves To Milwaukee|eventually left Boston for Milwaukee]] and is now playing in [[Atlanta]].\n\n[[File:BostonRedSox1908logo.svg|thumb|left|The Red Sox logo worn on uniforms in 1908, announcing the team's first official nickname]]In 1901, the upstart [[American League]] established a competing club in Boston. (Originally, a team was supposed to be started in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], but league ownership at the last minute removed that city from their plans in favor of the expansion Boston franchise.) For seven seasons, the AL team wore ''dark blue'' stockings and had no official nickname. They were simply \"Boston\", \"Bostonians\" or \"the Bostons\"; or the \"Americans\" or \"Boston Americans\" as in \"American Leaguers\", Boston being a two-team city. Their 1901\u20131907 jerseys, both home, and road, just read \"Boston\", except for 1902 when they sported large letters \"B\" and \"A\" denoting \"Boston\" and \"American.\" Newspaper writers of the time used other nicknames for the club, including \"Somersets\" (for owner [[Charles Somers]]), \"Plymouth Rocks\", \"Beaneaters\", the \"Collinsites\" (for manager [[Jimmy Collins]])\", and \"Pilgrims.\"\n\nFor years many sources have listed \"Pilgrims\" as the early Boston AL team's ''official'' nickname, but researcher Bill Nowlin has demonstrated that the name was barely used, if at all, during the team's early years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/boston_pilgrims_story.shtml |title=The Boston Pilgrims Never Existed |author=Bill Nowlin |work=Baseball Almanac}} First appeared in SABR's ''The National Pastime'' (No. 23) on page 71. Apparently \"Pilgrims\" originated with a writer for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' during 1906, and by 1907 it started to be retroactively applied to the 1903 club, even by Boston newspapers.</ref> The origin of the nickname appears to be a poem entitled \"The Pilgrims At Home\" written by Edwin Fitzwilliam that was sung at the 1907 home opener (\"Rory O'More\" melody).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrateboston.com/sports/baseball/bostonpilgrims.htm |title=The Boston Pilgrims Did Exist |publisher=Celebrateboston.com |access-date=October 31, 2013}}</ref> This nickname was commonly used during that season, perhaps because the team had a new manager and several rookie players. [[John I. Taylor]] had said in December 1907 that the Pilgrims \"sounded too much like homeless wanderers.\"\n\nThe National League club in Boston, though seldom called the \"Red Stockings\" anymore, still wore red trim. In 1907, the National League club adopted an all-white uniform, and the American League team saw an opportunity. On December 18, 1907, Taylor announced that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color. The 1908 uniforms featured a large icon of a red stocking angling across the shirt front. For 1908, the National League club returned to wearing red trim, but the American League team finally had an official nickname and remained the \"Red Sox\" for good.\n\nThe name is often [[List of baseball nicknames|shortened]] to \"Bosox\" or \"BoSox\", a combination of \"Boston\" and \"Sox\" (similar to the [[Chicago White Sox|\"ChiSox\"]] in Chicago or the minor league [[Worcester Red Sox|\"WooSox\"]] of Worcester, a minor league affiliate of Boston). Sportswriters sometimes refer to the Red Sox as the ''Crimson Hose''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.courant.com/colin_mcenroe_to_wit/2007/10/crimson-hose.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516201342/http://blogs.courant.com/colin_mcenroe_to_wit/2007/10/crimson-hose.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 16, 2016|title=Colin McEnroe at the Hartford Courant}}</ref> and ''the Olde Towne Team''. Recently, media have begun to call them the \"Sawx\" casually, reflecting how the word is pronounced with a [[New England English|New England accent]].

The right-field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams' left-handed swing, and are sometimes called \"Williamsburg.\" Before this addition, it was over {{convert|400|ft|m}} to right field. He served two stints in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a pilot and saw [[active duty]] in both World War II and the [[Korean War]], missing at least five full seasons of baseball. His book ''The Science of Hitting'' is widely read by students of baseball. He is currently the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, batting .406 in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/w/willite01.shtml |title=Ted Williams Statistics \u2014 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career, calling them \"The Knights of the Keyboard\", and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion.\n\nWith Williams, the Red Sox reached the [[1946 World Series]] but lost to the [[1946 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games in part because of the use of the \"Williams Shift\", a defensive tactic in which the shortstop moves to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field. Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game. His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier. Either way, in his only World Series, Williams gathered just five singles in 25 [[At bat|at-bats]] for a .200 average.\n\nThe Cardinals won the 1946 Series when [[Enos Slaughter]] scored the go-ahead run all the way from first base on a [[Hit (baseball)|base hit]] to left field. The throw from [[Leon Culberson]] was cut off by shortstop [[Johnny Pesky]], who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late. Some say Pesky hesitated or \"held the ball\" before he turned to throw the ball, but this has been disputed.\n\nAlong with Williams and Pesky, the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940s, including second baseman [[Bobby Doerr]] and center fielder [[Dom DiMaggio]] (the younger brother of [[Joe DiMaggio]]).\n\nThe Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in 1948 and 1949. In 1948, [[1948 Boston Red Sox season|Boston]] finished in a tie with [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]], and their loss to Cleveland in a [[one-game playoff]] ended hopes of an all-Boston World Series. Curiously, manager [[Joe McCarthy (baseball manager)|Joseph McCarthy]] chose journeyman [[Denny Galehouse]] to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom [[Mel Parnell]] was available to pitch. In 1949, the [[1949 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] were one game ahead of the [[1949 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], with the only two games left for both teams being against each other, and they lost both of those games.\n\nThe 1950s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox. After Williams returned from the Korean War in 1953, many of the best players from the late 1940s had retired or been traded. The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox' daily lineup \"Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs.\" [[Jackie Robinson]] was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park, however, owner Tom Yawkey did not want an African American player on his team. [[Willie Mays]] also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts. In 1955, [[Frank Malzone]] debuted at third base and Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in 1957, but there was little else for Boston fans to root for. Williams retired at the end of the 1960 [[1960 Major League Baseball season|season]], famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat as memorialized in the [[John Updike]] story \"Hub fans bid Kid adieu.\" The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an [[African American]] player when they promoted [[infielder]] [[Pumpsie Green]] from their AAA [[farm team]] in 1959.\n\n===1960s: Yaz and the Impossible Dream===\n{{Main|The Impossible Dream (1967)}}\n<!--No Source Information: [[File:Carl_yastrzemski.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Carl \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski]]-->\nThe 1960s also started poorly for the Red Sox, though 1961 saw the debut of [[Carl Yastrzemski|Carl \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski]], Williams' replacement in left field, who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching-rich decade.\n\nRed Sox fans know 1967 as the [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|season]] of the \"Impossible Dream.\" The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular [[Musical theatre|musical play]] \"[[Man of La Mancha]]\". 1967 saw one of the great pennant races in [[History of baseball|baseball history]] with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game. The BoSox had finished the 1966 [[1966 Major League Baseball season|season]] in ninth place, but they found new life with Yastrzemski as the team won the pennant to reach the [[1967 World Series]].  Yastrzemski won the American League Triple Crown (the most recent player to accomplish such a feat until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012), hitting .326 with 44 [[home run]]s and 121 [[runs batted in]]. He was named the league's Most Valuable Player, just one vote shy of a unanimous selection as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder [[C\u00e9sar Tovar]] first on his ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/y/yastrca01.shtml |title=Carl Yastrzemski Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=February 17, 2008}}</ref> But the Red Sox lost the series to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games.

He was struck just above the left [[Zygomatic bone|cheek bone]] by a fastball thrown by [[Jack Hamilton (baseball)|Jack Hamilton]] of the [[1967 California Angels season|California Angels]] on Friday, August 18, 1967, and sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision. Although he did have a productive season in 1970, he was never the same.\n\n===1970s: The Red Hat Era===\nAlthough the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s, they never finished higher than second place in their division. The closest they came to a divisional title was 1972 when they lost by a half-game to the [[1972 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. The start of the season was delayed by a players' strike, and the Red Sox had lost one more game to the strike than the Tigers had. Games lost to the strike were not made up. The Red Sox went to Detroit with a half-game lead for the final series of the season, but lost the first two of those three and were eliminated from the pennant race.\n\n====1975====\nThe Red Sox won the AL pennant in 1975. The [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|1975 Red Sox]] were as colorful as they were talented, with Yastrzemski and rookie outfielders [[Jim Rice]] and [[Fred Lynn]], veteran outfielder [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]], [[catcher]] [[Carlton Fisk]], and pitchers [[Luis Tiant]] and eccentric junkballer [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill \"The Spaceman\" Lee]]. Fred Lynn won both the American League [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award and the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] award, a feat which had never previously been accomplished, and was not duplicated until [[Ichiro Suzuki]] did it in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/roy_rol.shtml |title=Rookie of the Year Awards & Rolaids Relief Award Winners \u2014 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=October 31, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"oezowb\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/mvp_cya.shtml |title=Most Valuable Player MVP Awards & Cy Young Awards Winners \u2013 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=October 31, 2013}}</ref> In the [[1975 American League Championship Series]], the Red Sox swept the [[1975 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]].\n\n[[File:Carlton Fisk 1976.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carlton Fisk]], best known for his \"waving fair\" home run in Game 6 of the [[1975 World Series]]]]\nIn the [[1975 World Series]], they faced the heavily favored [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], also known as [[The Big Red Machine]]. Luis Tiant won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2. Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history. Down 6\u20133 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Red Sox [[pinch hitter]] [[Bernie Carbo]] hit a three-run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman [[Rawly Eastwick]] to tie the game. In the top of the 11th inning, [[right fielder]] Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a [[Joe Morgan]] line drive and doubled off [[Ken Griffey, Sr.|Ken Griffey]] at first base to preserve the tie. In the bottom of the 12th inning, Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball that sliced towards the left-field foul pole above the [[Green Monster]]. As the ball sailed into the night, Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory, seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul. The ball complied, and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7\u20136.\n\nThe Red Sox lost game 7, 4\u20133 even though they had an early 3\u20130 lead. Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a \"Leephus pitch\" or \"space ball\" to Reds first baseman [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street. The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning. Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, \"We won that thing 3 games to 4.\"\n\n====1978 pennant race====\nIn 1978, the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race. The Yankees were {{frac|14|1|2}} [[games behind]] the Red Sox in July, and on September 10, after completing a 4-game sweep of the Red Sox (known as \"The Boston Massacre\"), the Yankees tied for the divisional lead.\n\nOn September 16 the Yankees held a {{frac|3|1|2}} game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season, the Yankees' magic number to win the division was one\u2014with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the [[1978 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] clinching the division. However, [[1978 New York Yankees season|New York]] lost 9\u20132 and Boston won 5\u20130, forcing a one-game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday, October 2.\n\nThe most remembered moment from the game was [[Bucky Dent]]'s 7th inning three-run home run in off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster, giving the Yankees their first lead.<ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=145\u2013147}}</ref> The dejected Boston manager, [[Don Zimmer]], gave Mr. Dent a new middle name which lives on in Boston sports lore to this day, uttering three words as the ball sailed over the left-field wall: \"Bucky Fucking Dent!\" [[Reggie Jackson]] provided a solo home run in the 8th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees' 5\u20134 win, which ended with Yastrzemski popping out to [[Graig Nettles]] in foul territory with [[Rick Burleson]] representing the tying run at third. Although Dent became a Red Sox demon, the Red Sox got retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their manager during a series at Fenway Park.<ref name=BuckyDent>{{cite news|title=Dent Dumped by Yankees|date=June 7, 1990|author-link=Nick Cafardo|first=Nick|last=Cafardo|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=37|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/61640175.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+7%2C+1990&author=Nick+Cafardo%2C+Globe+Staff&pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=37&desc=DENT+DUMPED+BY+YANKEES|access-date=January 31, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715111312/https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/61640175.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+7,+1990&author=Nick+Cafardo,+Globe+Staff&pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=37&desc=DENT+DUMPED+BY+YANKEES|archive-date=July 15, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===1986 World Series and Game Six===\nCarl Yastrzemski retired after the 1983 season, during which the [[1983 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] finished sixth in the seven-team AL East, posting their worst record since 1966.\n\nHowever, in 1986, it appeared that the team's fortunes were about to change. The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, [[Don Baylor]] and [[Wade Boggs]]. [[Roger Clemens]] led the pitching staff, going 24\u20134 with a 2.48 [[Earned run average|ERA]], and had a 20-strikeout game<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/c/clemero02.shtml|title=Roger Clemens Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=February 17, 2008}}</ref> to win both the [[American League]] [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] and Most Valuable Player awards. Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since [[Vida Blue]] in 1971.<ref name=\"oezowb\" /> Despite spending a month and a half on the disabled list in the middle of the season, left-hander [[Bruce Hurst]] went 13\u20138, striking out 167 and pitching four shutout games. Boston sportswriters that season compared Clemens and Hurst to [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Sandy Koufax]] from the 1960s [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].\n\nThe [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, and faced the [[1986 California Angels season|California Angels]] in the [[1986 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two home games, taking a 3\u20131 lead in the series. With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5\u20132 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5. A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one. With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, [[Dave Henderson]] homered off [[Donnie Moore]] to put Boston up 6\u20135. Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the eleventh on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore. The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title.\n\nThe Red Sox faced a heavily favored [[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the [[1986 World Series]]. Boston won the first two games in [[Shea Stadium]] but lost the next two at Fenway, knotting the series at two games apiece. After Bruce Hurst recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5, the Red Sox returned to [[Shea Stadium]] looking to garner their first championship in 68 years. However, Game 6 became one of the most devastating losses in club history. After pitching seven strong innings, Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3\u20132 lead. Years later, Manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]] said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game, a claim Clemens denied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?id=1206543|title=ESPN: Page 2: Is Clemens the Antichrist?|work=ESPN}}</ref> The Mets then scored a run off [[relief pitcher|reliever]] and former Met [[Calvin Schiraldi]] to tie the score 3\u20133. The game went to extra innings, where the Red Sox took a 5\u20133 lead in the top of the 10th on a solo home run by Henderson, a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]].\n\nAfter recording two outs in the bottom of the 10th, a graphic appeared on the [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC telecast]] hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game and [[Bruce Hurst]] as Most Valuable Player of the World Series. A message even appeared briefly on the Shea Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as World Series champions. After so many years of abject frustration, Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory. With the count at two balls and one strike, Mets catcher [[Gary Carter]] hit a single. It was followed by singles by [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]] and [[Ray Knight]]. With [[Mookie Wilson]] batting, a wild pitch by [[Bob Stanley (baseball)|Bob Stanley]] tied the game at 5. Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first; the ball rolled through [[Bill Buckner]]'s legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second.\n[[File:Roger Clemens 1996.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Roger Clemens]] is the club's all-time strikeout (2,590), wins (192), and shutouts (38) leader.]]\nWhile Buckner was singled out as responsible for the loss, many observers\u2014as well as both Wilson and Buckner\u2014have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson probably would have still been safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out.\n\nMany observers questioned why Buckner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that [[Dave Stapleton (infielder)|Dave Stapleton]] had come in as a late-inning defensive replacement in prior series games. It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buckner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game. After falling behind 3\u20130, the Mets then won Game 7, concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were \"cursed.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Babe Ruth Curse Strikes Again|date=October 28, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|work=The New York Times|page=D33|author-link=George Vecsey}}</ref>\n\nThis World Series loss had a strange twist: Red Sox General Manager [[Lou Gorman]] was vice-president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983.<ref name=\"Gorman\"/> Working under Mets' GM [[Frank Cashen]], with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.<ref name=\"Gorman\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/sports/baseball/02gorman.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220101/https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/sports/baseball/02gorman.html |archive-date=January 1, 2022 |url-access=limited|title=Lou Gorman, Whose Red Sox Lost to Mets, Dies at 82|date=April 2, 2011|first=Bruce|last=Weber|newspaper=The New York Times|page=B8}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131991: Morgan Magic===\nThe [[1988 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] returned to the postseason in 1988.

The club immediately won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what was called ''Morgan Magic''. But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1988 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. The Most Valuable Player of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player [[Dennis Eckersley]], who saved all four wins for Oakland. Two years later, in 1990, the [[1990 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] again won the division and face the [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]] in the [[1990 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].

After the ALDS victory, the Red Sox lost the [[1999 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] to the Yankees, four games to one.

His #34 was retired by the club in 2017.]]\nDuring the 2003\u201304 offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher, [[Curt Schilling]], and a closer, [[Keith Foulke]]. Due to some midseason struggles with injuries, management shook up the team at the July 31 trading deadline as part of a four-team trade. The Red Sox traded the team's popular, yet oft-injured, shortstop [[Nomar Garciaparra]] and outfielder [[Matt Murton]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]], and received first baseman [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] from the [[Minnesota Twins]], and shortstop [[Orlando Cabrera]] from the [[Montreal Expos]]. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox acquired center fielder [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Following the trades, the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as \"the Idiots\", a term coined by Damon and Millar during the playoff push to describe the team's eclectic roster and devil-may-care attitude toward their supposed \"curse.\"\n\nBoston began the postseason by sweeping the [[American League West|AL West]] champion [[2004 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]] in the [[2004 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. In the third game of the series, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game and the series to advance to a rematch of the previous year's ALCS in the [[2004 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] against the [[2004 New York Yankees season|Yankees]]. The ALCS started very poorly for the Red Sox, as they lost the first three games (including a crushing 19\u20138 home loss in game 3). In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4\u20133 in the ninth with [[Mariano Rivera]] in to close for the Yankees. After Rivera issued a walk to Millar, Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base. He then scored on an RBI single by [[Bill Mueller]], sending the game into extra innings. The Red Sox went on to win the game 6\u20134 on a two-run home run by Ortiz in the 12th inning. The odds were still very much against the Sox in the series, but Ortiz also made the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of Game 5. The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in Game 6. Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game, famously making his sock appear bloody red. With it, Boston became the first team in MLB history to force a series-deciding Game 7 after trailing 3\u20130 in games. The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in Game 7 with a 10\u20133 victory over the Yankees. Ortiz began the scoring with a two-run homer. Along with his game-winning runs batted in during games 4 and 5, he was named ALCS Most Valuable Player. The Red Sox joined the [[1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1942 Toronto Maple Leafs]] and the [[1974\u201375 New York Islanders season|1975 New York Islanders]] as the only [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American professional sports]] teams in history at the time to win a best-of-seven games series after being down 3\u20130. (The [[2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers season|2010 Philadelphia Flyers]] and the [[2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings season|2014 Los Angeles Kings]] would later accomplish the feat).\n\nThe Red Sox swept the [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2004 World Series]]. The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series; [[Mark Bellhorn]] hit a game-winning home run off [[Pesky's Pole]] in game 1, and Schilling pitched another bloodied-sock victory in game 2, followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and [[Derek Lowe]]. It was the Red Sox' first championship in 86 years. Manny Ram\u00edrez was named [[World Series MVP]]. To add a final, surreal touch to Boston's championship season, on the night of Game 4 a [[October 2004 lunar eclipse|total lunar eclipse]] colored the moon red over [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their season, such as in December, when ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 [[Sportsman of the Year|Sportsmen of the Year]].\n\n====2007: World Series Championship====\n{{Main|2007 Boston Red Sox season|2007 World Series}}\n[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|right|thumb|2007 season final standing]]\n[[File:Boston Red Sox George W. Bush.jpg|thumb|right|Victorious Red Sox players being honored at the [[White House]] by President [[George W. Bush]]]]\nThe 2005 AL East was decided on the last weekend of the season, with the [[2005 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] coming to Fenway Park with a one-game lead in the standings. The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees, 95\u201367. However, a playoff was not needed, as the loser of such a playoff would still make the playoffs as a wild card team. As the Yankees had won the season series, they were awarded the division title, and the Red Sox competed in the playoffs as the wild card team. Boston failed to defend their championship, and was swept in three games by the eventual [[2005 World Series]] champion [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[2005 American League Division Series|first round]] of the playoffs. In 2006 [[David Ortiz]] broke [[Jimmie Foxx]]'s single-season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers. However, Boston failed to make the playoffs after compiling a 9\u201321 record in the month of August due to several injuries in the club's roster.\n\nTheo Epstein's first step toward restocking the team for 2007 was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history. On November 14, MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] superstar pitcher [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]]. Boston placed a bid of $51.1&nbsp;million to negotiate with Matsuzaka and completed a 6-year, $52&nbsp;million contract after they were announced as the winning bid.\n\nThe Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid-April and never relinquished their division lead. Initially, rookie second baseman [[Dustin Pedroia]] under-performed, hitting below .200 in April. Manager [[Terry Francona]] refused to bench him and his patience paid off as Pedroia eventually won the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|AL Rookie of the Year Award]] for his performance that season, which included 165 hits and a .317 batting average. On the mound, [[Josh Beckett]] emerged as the ace of the staff with his first 20-win season, as fellow starting pitchers Schilling, Matsuzaka, Wakefield and [[Juli\u00e1n Tav\u00e1rez]] all struggled at times. Relief pitcher [[Hideki Okajima]], another recent arrival from the NPB, posted an ERA of 0.88 through the first half and was selected for the All-Star Game. Okajima finished the season with a 2.22 ERA and 5 saves, emerging as one of baseball's top relievers. Minor league call-up [[Clay Buchholz]] provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a [[no-hitter]] in his second career start. The Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995.\n\nThe Red Sox swept the [[2007 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] in the [[2007 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. Facing the [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in the [[2007 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Red Sox fell in games 2, 3, and 4 before Beckett picked up his second victory of the series in game 5, starting a comeback. The Red Sox captured their twelfth American League pennant by outscoring the Indians 30\u20135 over the final three games. The Red Sox faced the [[2007 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] in the [[2007 World Series]], and swept the Rockies in four games. In Game 4, Wakefield gave up his spot in the rotation to a recovered [[Jon Lester]], who gave the Red Sox an impressive start, pitching {{frac|5|2|3}} shutout innings. Key home runs late in the game by third baseman [[Mike Lowell]] and pinch-hitter [[Bobby Kielty]] secured the Red Sox' second title in four years, as Lowell was named Most Valuable Player in the World Series.\n\n====2008\u20132012: Injuries and collapses====\nThe Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in Japan, where they defeated the [[2008 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the [[Tokyo Dome]]. On May 19, Jon Lester threw the 18th no-hitter in team history, defeating the [[2008 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] 7\u20130. Down the stretch, outfielder [[Manny Ramirez]] became embroiled in controversy surrounding public incidents with fellow players and other team employees, as well as criticism of ownership and not playing, which some claimed was due to laziness and nonexistent injuries. The front office decided to move the disgruntled outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline, shipping him to the Dodgers in a three-way deal with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] that landed them [[Jason Bay]] to replace him in left field.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/08/01/going_going_gone/|title=Going, going, gone|work=The Boston Globe|date=August 1, 2008}}</ref> With Ramirez gone, and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup, the Red Sox improved vastly and made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. The Red Sox defeated the [[2008 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] in the [[2008 American League Division Series|2008 ALDS]] three games to one. The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] in the [[2008 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. Down three games to one in the 5th game of the ALCS, Boston mounted a comeback from trailing 7\u20130 in the 7th inning to win 8\u20137.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=281016102 |title=Drew's game-winning hit keeps Red Sox alive in ALCS|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=October 16, 2008|access-date=October 17, 2008}}</ref><ref name=17alcs>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/sports/baseball/17alcs.html|title=Down by 7\u20130, Red Sox Force a Game 6|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=October 17, 2008|first=Jack|last=Curry|author-link=Jack Curry|date=October 17, 2008}}</ref> They tied the series at three games apiece with a Game 6 victory before losing Game 7, 3\u20131, thus becoming the eighth team in a row since 2000 to fail to repeat as World Series champions.\n\nThe Red Sox returned to postseason play in 2009 but were swept in the ALDS by the [[2009 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels]]. In 2010, they placed third in the division and failed to make the playoffs. In 2011, the [[2011 Boston Red Sox season#Collapse|Red Sox collapsed]], becoming the first team in MLB history to blow a 9-game lead in the division heading into September, going 7\u201320 in the final month and failing again to make the playoffs. In December 2011, [[Bobby Valentine]] was hired as a new manager. The 2012 season marked the centennial of [[Fenway Park]], and on April 20, past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park's anniversary. However, the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season. The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries, inconsistent play, and off-field news. They finished 69\u201393 for their first losing season since 1997 and their worst season since 1965.\n\n[[File:Massachusetts State House Red Sox Banner.JPG|thumb|The [[Massachusetts State House]] displaying a banner in honor of the Red Sox's [[2013 World Series]] appearance.

These acquisitions included veteran catcher [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]], [[Jonny Gomes]], [[Mike Napoli]] and [[Shane Victorino]]. While some questioned these players as \"re-treads\", it was clear that Cherington was trying to move past 2011\u20132012 by bringing in \"clubhouse players\". Essential to the turnaround, however, was the pitching staff. With ace veteran [[John Lackey]] coming off [[Tommy John surgery]] and both Jon Lester and [[Clay Buchholz]] returning to their prior form, this allowed the team to rely less on their bullpen. Everything seemed in danger of collapsing, however, when both [[closer (baseball)|closers]], [[Joel Hanrahan]] and [[Andrew Bailey (baseball)|Andrew Bailey]], went down early with season-ending injuries.
