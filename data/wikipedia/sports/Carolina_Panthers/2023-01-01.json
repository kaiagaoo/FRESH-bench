The Panthers compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL), as a member club of the league's [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC South|South]] division. The team is headquartered in [[Bank of America Stadium]] in [[Uptown Charlotte]]; the stadium also serves as the team's [[Home (sports)|home field]]. The Panthers are supported throughout the [[Carolinas]]; although the team has played its home games in Charlotte since 1996, they played their home games at [[Memorial Stadium (Clemson)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Clemson, South Carolina]] during its first season. The team hosts its annual [[training camp]] at [[Wofford College]] in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]. Along with the [[New England Patriots]], it is one of only two teams representing multiple states.\n\nThe Panthers were announced as the league's 29th franchise in 1993 and began playing in 1995 under the original owner and founder [[Jerry Richardson]]. The Panthers played well in their first two years, finishing {{Win\u2013loss record|w=7|l=9}} in 1995 (an all-time best for an NFL expansion team's first season) and 12\u20134 the following year, winning the [[NFC West]] before ultimately losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[Green Bay Packers]] in the NFC Championship Game. They did not have another winning season until 2003 when they won the [[NFC Championship Game]] and reached [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], losing 32\u201329 to the New England Patriots. After recording playoff appearances in 2005 and 2008, the team failed to record another playoff appearance until 2013, the first of three consecutive NFC South titles. After losing in the divisional round to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in 2013 and the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in 2014, the Panthers [[Super Bowl 50|returned to the Super Bowl in 2016]] but lost to the [[Denver Broncos]]. Since then, the team has appeared in the playoffs only once, in [[2017 Carolina Panthers season|2017]]. The team's five NFC South titles since the division's establishment in 2002 rank second only to the [[New Orleans Saints]].\n\nAs of 2022, the Carolina Panthers remain the newest club in the NFC.
