They formed the initial schedule of what came to be known much later as the \"PGA Tour\", with the addition of the [[PGA Championship]] in 1916. [[The Open Championship]] in the UK, the oldest golf tournament in the world founded in 1860, would become a PGA Tour event much later in 1995.

After four tournaments, and every fourth tournament thereafter until the [[Korn Ferry Tour Finals]], players are re-ranked according to their tour earnings on the season. However, the ranking position of players who are exempt from a \"reshuffle\" does not change.\n* Those who finish 2nd through 10th (including ties) are exempt until the third reshuffle of the following season (first 12 events).\n* The medalist (top finisher) has full playing privileges for the entire regular season, which carries with it automatic entry to the Tour Finals.\n\nSince 2013, 50 Korn Ferry Tour golfers earn privileges during the next PGA Tour season, which now begins the month after the Tour Finals. The top 25 money winners over the regular season (i.e., before the Tour Finals) receive PGA Tour cards, as do the top 25 money winners in the Finals. The priority position of all 50 golfers on the PGA Tour is based on money earned during the Tour Finals, except that the regular season money leader shares equal status with the Finals money leader. In addition, a golfer who wins three events on that tour in a calendar year earns a \"performance promotion\" (informally a \"battlefield promotion\") which garners PGA Tour privileges for the remainder of the year plus the following full season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2016/08/07/web-com-tour-battlefield-promotion-earn-it-88899/ |title=What is the Web.com Tour Battlefield Promotion and how do you earn it? |website=TheGolfNewsNet.com |access-date=January 24, 2019 |archive-date=January 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125020407/https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2016/08/07/web-com-tour-battlefield-promotion-earn-it-88899/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of each year, the top 125 in FedEx Cup points (top 125 on the money list before 2013) receive a tour card for the following season, which gives them exemption from qualifying for most of the next year's tournaments. However, at some events, known as invitationals, exemptions apply only to the previous year's top 70 players. Since 2013, players who are ranked between 126 and 200 in FedEx Cup points (and are not already exempt by other means) are eligible for entry in the Korn Ferry Tour Finals, where they can regain their PGA Tour privileges. Non-exempt players who finish 126th\u2013150th in the FedEx Cup but fail to regain their PGA Tour cards are given conditional PGA Tour status for the season and are fully exempt on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nWinning a PGA Tour event provides a tour card for a minimum of two years, with an extra year added for each additional win with a maximum of five years. Winning a [[World Golf Championships]] event, [[The Tour Championship]], the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]], or the [[Memorial Tournament]] provides a three-year exemption. Winners of the [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]], [[The Players Championship]], and the [[FedEx Cup]] earn a five-year exemption. Other types of exemptions include lifetime exemptions for players with twenty wins on the tour; one-time, one-year exemptions for players in the top fifty on the career money earnings list who are not otherwise exempt; two-time, one-year exemptions for players in the top twenty-five on the career money list; and medical exemptions for players who have been injured or are going through a family crisis, which give them an opportunity to regain their tour card after a period out of the tour. In 2015, the PGA Tour added a clause which would freeze an exemption for those required to perform military service in their native countries in response to South Korea's [[Bae Sang-moon]] having to leave the Tour for that reason. Once a player wins a PGA Tour event, he will have at minimum past champion status should he fail to retain PGA Tour privileges.\n\nNon-members can play their way into the PGA Tour by finishing the equivalent or better of 125th in FedEx Cup points. Those who fail but fall within the top 200 in current season points are eligible for the Korn Ferry Tour Finals. During the season, non-members can earn Special Temporary Member status by exceeding the equivalent of 150th in the previous season's FedEx Cup. Special Temporary Members receive unlimited sponsor exemptions, while non-members are limited to seven per season and twelve total events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2018/04/22/pga-tour-special-temporary-membership-it-what-means-109311/|title=PGA Tour Special Temporary Membership: How to get it, what it means|website=Thegolfnewsnet.com|access-date=February 23, 2022|archive-date=July 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220702013704/https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2018/04/22/pga-tour-special-temporary-membership-it-what-means-109311/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to other major league sports, there is no rule that limits PGA Tour players to \"men only\".

However, monies raised for charities derive from the tournaments' positive revenues (if any), and not any actual monetary donation from the PGA Tour, whose purse monies and expenses are guaranteed. The number of charities which receive benefits from PGA Tour, PGA Tour Champions and Korn Ferry Tour events is estimated at over 2,000.

While it considered invoking an option to opt out of its broadcast television contracts in 2017, the PGA Tour ultimately decided against doing so. [[Golf Channel]] (which, since the [[Acquisition of NBC Universal by Comcast|acquisition of NBC Universal by Golf Channel owner Comcast]], is a division of NBC Sports) has served as the pay television rightsholder of the PGA Tour since 2007. Under the contracts, CBS broadcasts weekend coverage for an average of 20 events per-season, and NBC broadcasts weekend coverage for an average of 10 events per-season. Golf Channel broadcasts early-round and weekend morning coverage of all events, as well as weekend coverage of events not broadcast on terrestrial television, and primetime encores of all events.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2011/09/pga-tour-signs-new-9-year-agreements-with-nbc-cbs-165940/ |title=PGA Tour Signs New 9-Year Agreements With NBC & CBS |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=2011-09-01 |work=Deadline |access-date=2018-11-18 |df=mdy-all |archive-date=November 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119091917/https://deadline.com/2011/09/pga-tour-signs-new-9-year-agreements-with-nbc-cbs-165940/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/pga-tour-opts-to-continue-its-relationship-with-cbs-nbc |title=PGA Tour opts to continue its relationship with CBS, NBC |last=Wacker |first=Brian |magazine=Golf Digest |date=September 3, 2017 |access-date=2018-11-18 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/6917164/pga-tour-signs-nine-year-tv-rights-extension-cbs-nbc |title=PGA Tour signs 9-year extension with networks |publisher=ESPN |date=September 1, 2011 |access-date=2018-11-18 |df=mdy-all |archive-date=November 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119091934/http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/6917164/pga-tour-signs-nine-year-tv-rights-extension-cbs-nbc |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn March 9, 2020, the PGA Tour announced that it had reached an agreement to renew its contracts with CBS and NBC, which expired after the 2020\u201321 season, through 2030, maintaining most of the existing broadcast arrangements, but with the rights to the final three events of the FedEx Cup playoffs now alternating between CBS and NBC annually.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/SB-Blogs/Newsletter-Media/2019/12/16.aspx|title=SBJ Media: PGA Tour, Mountain West Get New Rights Deals|website=Sports Business Daily|access-date=2019-12-17|archive-date=December 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217032639/https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/SB-Blogs/Newsletter-Media/2019/12/16.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/media/cbs-nbc-re-pga-tour-9-year-63-billion-deal/2243056|title=CBS, NBC re-up with the PGA Tour in a 9-year, $6.3&nbsp;billion deal|date=2020-03-09|website=Advertising Age|language=en|access-date=2020-03-09|archive-date=April 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200411190209/https://adage.com/article/media/cbs-nbc-re-pga-tour-9-year-63-billion-deal/2243056|url-status=live}}</ref> A notable change in production under the new contract is that the PGA Tour now controls the on-site production and infrastructure for all media partners, although each individual broadcaster continues to employ their own on-air talent and personnel.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dachman |first=Jason |date=2022-01-25 |title=It's a New Era for CBS Sports Golf as PGA Tour Takes Over Onsite Facilities |url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2022/01/25/its-a-new-era-for-cbs-sports-golf-as-pga-tour-takes-over-onsite-facilities/ |access-date=2022-01-31 |website=Sports Video Group |archive-date=January 31, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220131042007/https://www.sportsvideo.org/2022/01/25/its-a-new-era-for-cbs-sports-golf-as-pga-tour-takes-over-onsite-facilities/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nTournaments typically featured in NBC's package include marquee events such as [[The Players Championship]], and the biennial [[Presidents Cup]] event.

In the past, this has threatened to make the last {{frac|2|1|2}} months of the season anticlimactic, as some of the very top players competed less from that point on. In response, the PGA Tour has introduced a new format, the [[FedEx Cup]]. From January through mid-August players compete in \"regular season\" events and earn FedEx Cup points, in addition to prize money. At the end of the regular season, the top 125 FedEx Cup points winners are eligible to compete in the \"playoffs\", four events taking place from mid-August to mid-September. The field sizes for these events are reduced from 125 to 100 to 70 and finally the traditional 30 for the Tour Championship. Additional FedEx Cup points are earned in these events. At the end of the championship, the top point winner is the season champion. To put this new system into place, the PGA Tour has made significant changes to the traditional schedule.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:FedexCup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The logo of the FedEx Cup]] -->\nIn 2007, [[The Players Championship]] moved to May so as to have a marquee event in five consecutive months. The [[Tour Championship]] moved to mid-September, with an international team event ([[Ryder Cup]] or [[Presidents Cup]]) following at the end of September. The schedule was tweaked slightly in both 2008 and 2009. After the third FedEx Cup playoff event, the [[BMW Championship (PGA Tour)|BMW Championship]], the Tour takes a full week off. In 2008, the break came before the Ryder Cup, with the Tour Championship the week after that. In 2009, the break was followed by the Tour Championship, with the Presidents Cup taking place two weeks after that.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe Tour continues through the fall, with the focus on the scramble of the less successful players to earn enough money to retain their tour cards. A circuit known as the [[PGA Tour Fall Series|Fall Series]], originally with seven tournaments but now with four, was introduced in 2007. In its inaugural year, its events were held in seven consecutive weeks, starting the week after the Tour Championship. As was the case for the FedEx Cup playoff schedule, the Fall Series schedule was also tweaked in 2008 and 2009. The first 2008 Fall Series event was held opposite the Ryder Cup, and the Fall Series took a week off for the Tour Championship before continuing with its remaining six events.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe Fall Series saw major changes for 2009, with one of its events moving to May and another dropping off the schedule entirely. It returned to its original start date of the week after the Tour Championship. Then, as in 2008, it took a week off, this time for the Presidents Cup. It then continued with events in three consecutive weeks, took another week off for the HSBC Champions (now elevated to World Golf Championships status), and concluded the week after that.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe Fall Series was reduced to four events, all held after the Tour Championship, for 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-12-03 |title=Tour releases 2011 schedule |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/golf/news/article-golftalkcentral-tour-releases-2011-schedule |access-date=2024-05-02 |website=NBC Sports |language=en-US}}</ref> This followed the move of the [[Viking Classic]] into the regular season as an alternate event.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n2007 saw the introduction of a tournament in Mexico, an alternate event staged the same week as the [[WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/info/company/story/9163568 |title=PGA Tour to conduct official-money event in Mexico |publisher=PGA Tour |date=January 13, 2006 |access-date=May 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108160330/http://www.pgatour.com/info/company/story/9163568/ |archive-date=January 8, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A tournament in Puerto Rico was introduced in 2008 as an alternate event staged opposite the [[WGC-CA Championship]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n===Tournaments===\nThe [[2013 PGA Tour|2013 season]], which was the last before the tour transitioned to a schedule spanning two calendar years, had 40 official-money events in 38 weeks, including three alternate events played the same week as a higher-status tournament.

With the change to an October-to-September season, several of the former Fall Series events will now open the season. The Tour also sanctions two events in Asia during that part of the year:\n* The [[CIMB Classic]], a limited-field event held in Malaysia and the Tour's first sanctioned event in Southeast Asia.

The geography of the tour is determined by climate. It starts in Hawaii in January and spends most of its first two months in California and [[Arizona]] during what is known as the \"West Coast Swing\" and then moves to the American Southeast for the \"Southern Swing\". Each swing culminates in a significant tour event. In April, tour events begin to drift north. The summer months are spent mainly in the Northeast and the Midwest, and in the fall (autumn) the tour heads south again.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn most of the regular events on tour, the field is either 132, 144 or 156 players, depending on time of year (and available daylight hours). All players making the cut earn money for the tournament with the winner usually receiving 18% of the total purse.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn 2008, the PGA Tour Policy Board approved a change in the number of players that will make the cut. The cut will continue to be low 70 professionals and ties, unless that results in a post-cut field of more than 78 players. Under that circumstance, the cut score will be selected to make a field as close to 70 players as possible without exceeding 78. Players who are cut in such circumstances but who have placed 70th or worse will get credit for making the cut and will earn official money and FedEx Cup points. This policy affected two of the first three events with cuts, the [[Sony Open in Hawaii]] and the [[Buick Invitational]]. In late February, the Policy Board announced a revised cut policy, effective beginning with the [[Honda Classic]]. The new policy calls for 36-hole cut to the low 70 professionals and ties and, if that cut results in more than 78 players, a second 54-hole cut to the low 70 professionals and ties. Those who do not survive the 54-hole cut were designated as MDF (made the cut, did not finish).<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.pgatour.com/news/2008/02/26/cut.html |title=PGA Tour Policy Board makes immediate changes to cut policy |publisher=PGA Tour |date=February 28, 2008 |access-date=August 30, 2013}}</ref> For the 2020 season, the cut line was reduced to 65 plus ties and eliminated the 54-hole cut.\n\nIn the event that the PGA Tour cannot guarantee four rounds of play, the PGA Tour can shorten an event to 54 holes. A 54-hole event is still considered official, with full points and monies awarded. Any tournament stopped before 54 holes can be completed is reverted to the 36-hole score and the win is considered unofficial, notably [[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]] at the [[2005 PGA Tour|2005]] [[Nissan Open]].\n\n===Priority ranking system===\nThe PGA Tour maintains a priority ranking system that is used to select the fields for most tournaments on tour.

Ordered by money won in career.\n\nSome tournaments deviate from this system; for example, the [[Phoenix Open]] has only five sponsor exemptions and three Monday qualifying spots, while invitational tournaments such as the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]], [[Memorial Tournament]], and [[Dean & DeLuca Invitational]] have completely different eligibility categories.\n\n===Event categories===\n;[[Men's major golf championships|Majors]]: The four leading annual events in world golf are the Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, The (British) Open Championship, and the PGA Championship. These events each automatically receive 100 OWGR points.\n;[[World Golf Championships]] (WGC): A set of events co-sanctioned by the [[International Federation of PGA Tours]] which attract the leading golfers from all over the world, including those who are not members of the PGA Tour. The [[WGC-HSBC Champions|HSBC Champions]] was made a WGC event in 2009.\n;Unique: Two tournaments rate as unique, for different reasons:\n*The [[Sentry Tournament of Champions]], the first tournament of the calendar year, has a field consisting of winners from the previous season's competition only. This results in a field much smaller than any other tournament except for [[The Tour Championship]], with no cut after 36 holes of play. \n*[[The Players Championship]] is the only event, apart from the majors and the World Golf Championships, which attracts entries from almost all of the world's elite golfers. It is the designated OWGR flagship event for the PGA Tour and awards 80 OWGR points to its winner. Only major championships can be awarded more OWGR points. For purposes of the [[FedEx Cup]] standings, The Players has had an identical point allocation to that of the majors since the Cup was instituted in [[2007 PGA Tour|2007]]. \n[[File:PGA Tour's FedEx Cup new.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The FedEx Cup, presented to the winner of the season-ending playoffs]]\n;Playoff event: The final three events of the season (four from 2007 to 2018) are the [[FedEx Cup]] playoffs. The top 125 players on the points list are eligible for the first event and the field size decreases to The Tour Championship with 30 players.\n[[File:Ryder Cup at the 2008 PGA Golf Show new.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Ryder Cup, contested in even-numbered years between teams from Europe and the United States]]\n;Team: A United States team of 12 elite players competes in the [[Ryder Cup]] and the [[Presidents Cup]] in alternate years. The Ryder Cup, pitting a team of U.S. golfers against a European team, is arguably the highest profile event in golf, outranking the majors. The Presidents Cup, which matches a team of U.S. golfers against an international team of golfers not eligible for the Ryder Cup, is less well established, but is still the main event of the week when it is played. There is no prize money in these events, so they are irrelevant to the money list, but an immense amount of pride rides on the results.\n;Regular: Routine weekly tour events. The \"regular\" events vary somewhat in status, but this is fairly subjective and not usually based on the size of the purse. Some of the factors which can determine the status of a tournament are:\n*Its position in the schedule, which influences the number of leading players that choose to enter.\n*Its age and the distinction of its past champions.\n*The repute of the course on which it is played.\n*Any associations with \"legends of golf\". Six events in particular have such associations (four of these are invitational events):\n**The [[AT&T Byron Nelson]], named after [[Byron Nelson]], was until 2007 the only current event named after a PGA Tour golfer.\n**The [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]], formerly the Bay Hill Invitational, closely identified with [[Arnold Palmer]] and played at a resort he owned.\n**The [[Genesis Invitational]], identified with [[Tiger Woods]] through his foundation as of 2020.\n**The [[Charles Schwab Challenge]], identified with [[Ben Hogan]].\n**The [[Memorial Tournament]], founded by [[Jack Nicklaus]], played on a course he designed, and annually honoring a selected \"legend\".\n;Invitational: These events are similar to the regular ones, but have a slightly smaller field and do not follow the normal PGA Tour exemption categories. Invitational tournaments include the [[Genesis Invitational]], the [[Charles Schwab Challenge]], the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]], the [[RBC Heritage]], the [[Memorial Tournament]]. The tournaments usually have an association with a golf legend, or in the case of the RBC Heritage, a famous course. The table below illustrates some of the notable features of the exemption categories for these events:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qualifying.pgatourhq.com/static-assets/uploads/2017-18_pga_tour_handbookregs_final.pdf|title=2017\u201318 PGA Tour Player Handbook & Tournament Regulations|access-date=July 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711234615/https://qualifying.pgatourhq.com/static-assets/uploads/2017-18_pga_tour_handbookregs_final.pdf|archive-date=July 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Overview of PGA Tour events\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=2|Tournament\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=2|Field<br />size\n!scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=2|Exemptions based on<br />FedEx Cup standings\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=2|Sponsor<br />exemptions\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=2|Method of filling field\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" |Previous year\n!scope=\"col\" |Current\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"| [[Genesis Invitational]]\n| 120 || Top 125 || Top 10 || 8 || Current FedEx Cup standings\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"| [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]]\n| 120 || Top 70 || Top 70 || 18 || Current FedEx Cup standings\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"| [[RBC Heritage]]\n| 132 || Top 125 || Top 10 || 8 || Standard exemption categories\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"| [[Charles Schwab Challenge]]\n| 120+ || Top 80 || Top 80 || 12 || Current FedEx Cup standings\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"| [[Memorial Tournament]]\n| 120 || Top 70 || Top 70 || 14 || Alternating current and previous year's<br />FedEx Cup standings\n|}\n;Alternate: Events which are played in the same week as a higher status tournament (either a WGC or the Open Championship) and therefore have weakened fields and reduced prize money. They are often considered an opportunity for players who would not qualify for certain events due to their world rankings, positions on the FedEx Cup points list, or position on the Tour's priority list to move up more easily or have an easier attempt at a two-year exemption for winning a tournament. Because of their weaker fields, these events usually receive the minimum amount of world ranking points reserved for PGA Tour events (24 points) and fewer FedEx Cup points than most tournaments (300 points instead of 500). Alternate event winners also do not earn Masters invitations. Fields for alternate events have 132 players. These events have 12 unrestricted sponsor exemptions, four more than the regular events.\n;Fall Series (defunct): Prior to the 2013 season, the PGA Tour included a fall series consisting of those events after the final playoff event of the FedEx Cup season (The Tour Championship) through the end of the calendar year. These events provided extra opportunities for players to retain their cards by finishing within the top 125 of the money list. Since fall 2013 (the 2014 season), the events held in the fall have opened the tour season, and receive full FedEx Cup points allocations and Masters invitations\n;{{anchor|ChallengeSeason}}<!--[[Challenge Season]] Redirects here-->Challenge Season: There are also a number of events which are recognized by the PGA Tour, but which do not count towards the official money list. Most of these take place in the off season (November and December). This slate of unofficial, often made-for-TV events (which have included the [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]], the [[Wendy's 3-Tour Challenge]], the [[Franklin Templeton Shootout]], the [[Skins Game (PGA Tour)|Skins Game]], etc.) is referred to as the \"Challenge Season\" or more commonly as the \"Silly Season\".\n\n===Changes since the 2013 season===\n{{Update|section|date=July 2018}}\nOn March 20, 2012, the tour announced radical changes to the tour's season and qualifying process.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7714944/pga-tour-changes-schedule-qualifying-process |title=PGA Tour announces changes |publisher=ESPN |date=March 21, 2012 |access-date=March 23, 2012 |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323024458/http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7714944/pga-tour-changes-schedule-qualifying-process |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Harig 2012-03-21\">{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7712436/decoding-pga-tour-scheduling-changes-2012-season |title=Decoding tour's schedule changes |first=Bob |last=Harig |publisher=ESPN |date=March 21, 2012 |access-date=March 23, 2012 |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323055659/http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7712436/decoding-pga-tour-scheduling-changes-2012-season |url-status=live }}</ref> Further details of these changes relating to the Fall Series were announced on June 26,<ref name=\"Fall Series full points\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.pgatour.com/news/2012/06/26/fedexcuppoints.html |title=Fall Series events to offer full FedExCup points |publisher=PGA Tour |date=June 26, 2012 |access-date=August 30, 2013}}</ref> with the remaining details announced on July 10.<ref name=Elling>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/golf/blog/eye-on-golf/19552949/pga-tour-finalizes-controversial-makeover-as-qualifying-school-gone-after-six-decade-run |title=PGA Tour finalizes controversial makeover as Qualifying School gone after six-decade run |first=Steve |last=Elling |work=CBS Sports: Eye on Golf |date=July 10, 2012 |access-date=July 10, 2012 |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712033637/http://www.cbssports.com/golf/blog/eye-on-golf/19552949/pga-tour-finalizes-controversial-makeover-as-qualifying-school-gone-after-six-decade-run |url-status=live }}</ref> One of the final details received a minor tweak, effective for the 2013 season only, on September 11.<ref name=\"AP consistency\">{{cite news |url=http://www.pgatour.com/news/2012/09/11/notebookap.html |title=Notes: Consistency becomes even more important in 2013 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=PGA Tour |date=September 11, 2012 |access-date=August 30, 2013 |archive-date=September 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918231618/http://www.pgatour.com/news/2012/09/11/notebookap.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nFirst, the 2013 season was the last to be conducted entirely within a calendar year.

Through 2012, the top 125 players on the money list at the end of the PGA Tour season retained their tour cards. For the 2013 season only, the top 125 players on ''both'' the money list and the FedEx Cup points list at the end of the FedEx Cup regular season in August retained their cards.<ref name=\"AP consistency\"/> The tour also said that it would decide at a later time whether to keep this aspect of the qualifying system in place in future seasons.<ref name=\"AP consistency\"/> Otherwise, the planned move by the tour to have the top 125 players on the FedEx Cup points list retain their tour cards took effect with the 2014 season. The next 75 players on the points list, along with the top 75 on the money list of the Korn Ferry Tour at the end of that tour's regular season, are eligible to play a series of three tournaments in September known as the [[Web.com Tour Finals|Korn Ferry Tour Finals]]. The Finals field, however, is not expected to consist of all 150 players, as some of the PGA Tour players will be exempt by other criteria, such as a tournament win in the previous two years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/8147517/top-25-webcom-tour-assured-getting-pga-card-new-system-does-away-q-school |title=Top 25 assured of PGA Tour card |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=July 10, 2012 |access-date=July 11, 2012 |archive-date=July 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711162945/http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/8147517/top-25-webcom-tour-assured-getting-pga-card-new-system-does-away-q-school |url-status=live }}</ref> A total of 50 PGA Tour cards for the next season is awarded at the end of the Finals.

Before 2013, neither event had full PGA Tour status despite being sanctioned by the Tour. Wins in the CIMB Classic were not classified as official PGA Tour wins, and HSBC Champions victories were official wins only for current PGA Tour members. Money earned in these events did not count as official PGA Tour earnings for any purpose.\n\n==== PGA Tour University ====\nIn June 2020, the PGA Tour announced the creation of PGA Tour University, a scheme to create pathways for collegiate golfers to join development tours operated by the PGA Tour. At its start, it planned to award [[Korn Ferry Tour]] cards to the top five collegiate golfers in the United States, and playing status on the [[PGA Tour Canada]], [[PGA Tour Latinoam\u00e9rica]], or [[PGA Tour China]] to the golfers ranked no. 6 through 15. The eligibility for these rankings was limited to seniors, as an incentive to encourage the top golfers to stay in college.<ref>{{cite news |date=2020-06-01 |title=What is PGA Tour University?

Those 6th through 10th are conditionally exempt on the [[Korn Ferry Tour]], fully exempt on PGA Tour Americas, and earn entry into the second stage of Q School. Players ranked 2nd to 5th are fully exempt on the Korn Ferry Tour, can earn unlimited PGA Tour sponsor exemptions, and are entered into the final stage of PGA Tour Q School. The top player is fully exempt on the PGA Tour for the remainder of the current season and all of the next season.
