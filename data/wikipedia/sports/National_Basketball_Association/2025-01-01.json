The [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award|Sixth Man of the Year Award]] is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The [[NBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player Award]] is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year Award]] is awarded to the league's best defender. The [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|Coach of the Year Award]] is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team.

Additionally, ''[[Sporting News]]'' awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year Award]] to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.\n\nThe postseason teams are the [[All-NBA Team]], the [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive Team]], and the [[NBA All-Rookie Team|All-Rookie Team]]; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable.

Seeds are awarded in strict order of regular season record (with a tiebreaker system used as needed).\n\nHaving a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed typically means a team faces a weaker opponent in the first round. The team in each series with the better record has home-court advantage, including the First Round.\n\nThe league began using its current format, with the top eight teams in each conference advancing regardless of divisional alignment, in the 2015\u201316 season. Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners.<ref>{{cite news |title=NBA to seed playoff teams in each conference by record |url=http://www.nba.com/2015/news/09/08/nba-playoff-seeding-change-ap.ap/ |agency=Associated Press |publisher=National Basketball Association |date=September 8, 2015 |access-date=July 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the first- and eighth-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the fourth- and fifth-seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the second- and seventh-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the third- and sixth-seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the [[NBA Finals]] followed a 2\u20133\u20132 pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5.<ref>{{cite news |title=NBA owners change Finals format to 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 |url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/10/23/nba-board-of-governors-format-change.ap |agency=Associated Press |publisher=National Basketball Association |date=October 23, 2013 |access-date=April 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515022449/http://www.nba.com/2013/news/10/23/nba-board-of-governors-format-change.ap/ |archive-date=May 15, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the [[NBA Finals]] and is held annually in June (sometimes, the series will start in late May).
