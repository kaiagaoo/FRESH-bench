On November 1, 1946, in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, the [[Toronto Huskies]] hosted the [[New York Knicks|New York Knickerbockers]] at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in a game the NBA now refers to as the first game played in NBA history.<ref name=\"firstgame\">{{cite web|title=History of Basketball in Canada|url=http://www.nba.com/canada/History_of_Basketball_in_Canad-Canada_Generic_Article-18023.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=March 8, 2002|access-date=December 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024035057/http://www.nba.com/canada/History_of_Basketball_in_Canad-Canada_Generic_Article-18023.html|archive-date=October 24, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first basket was made by [[Ossie Schectman]] of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the [[American Basketball League (1925\u201355)|American Basketball League]] (ABL) and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist [[Baltimore Bullets (1944\u201354)|Baltimore Bullets]] moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion [[Minneapolis Lakers]] won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948\u201349 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.<ref name=encyc>{{cite book|title=The Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia|publisher=Villard Books|date=1994|page=34|isbn=0-679-43293-0}}</ref>\n\nOn August 3, 1949, the remaining NBL teams\u2013Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo\u2013merged into the BAA. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed to the present National Basketball Association, even though the merged league retained the BAA's governing body, including [[Maurice Podoloff]] as president.<ref name=encyc/> To this day, the NBA claims the BAA's history as its own. It now reckons the arrival of the NBL teams as an expansion, not a merger, and does not recognize NBL records and statistics.<ref>{{cite web |title=NBA's bogus birthday sweeps Syracuse's contributions under the confetti (Editorial Board Opinion, Video) |url=https://www.syracuse.com/opinion/2021/11/nbas-bogus-birthday-sweeps-syracuses-contributions-under-the-confetti-editorial-board-opinion-video.html |website=syracuse |access-date=December 30, 2021 |date=November 28, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nba-is-born |title=NBA is born |work=History |access-date=July 29, 2010}}</ref> as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and [[Arsenal|armories]]. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1954\u201355, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the [[New York Knicks]], [[Boston Celtics]], [[Philadelphia Warriors]], [[Minneapolis Lakers]], [[Rochester Royals]], [[Fort Wayne Pistons]], [[Milwaukee Hawks]], and [[Syracuse Nationals]], all of which remain in the league today, although the latter six all did eventually relocate. The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks had shifted from the [[Quad Cities|Tri-Cities]] to [[Milwaukee]] in 1951, and later shifted to [[St. Louis]] in 1955.

Center [[Wilt Chamberlain]] entered the league with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s, setting new single-game records in scoring ([[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game|100]]) and rebounding (55). [[Russell\u2013Chamberlain rivalry|Russell's rivalry with Chamberlain]] became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of American team sports.\n\n[[File:Wilt Chamberlain Bill Russell 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bill Russell]] defending against [[Wilt Chamberlain]] in 1966.]]\n\nThe 1960s were dominated by the Celtics. Led by Russell, Cousy, and Auerbach, Boston won eight straight championships in the NBA from 1959 to 1966. This championship streak is the longest in NBA history. They did not win the title in [[1966\u201367 NBA season|1966\u201367]], but regained it in the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1967\u201368 season]] and repeated in [[1968\u201369 NBA season|1969]]. The domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Championship Wins|url=https://www.nba.com/celtics/history/championships|website=Celtics.com|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|access-date=December 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThrough this period, the NBA continued to evolve with the shift of the [[Minneapolis Lakers]] to Los Angeles, the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] to San Francisco, the [[Syracuse Nationals]] to [[Philadelphia]] to become the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], and the [[St. Louis Hawks]] moving to [[Atlanta]], as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises. The Chicago Packers (now [[Washington Wizards]]) became the ninth NBA team in 1961. From 1966 to 1968, the league expanded from 9 to 14 teams, introducing the [[Chicago Bulls]], [[Seattle SuperSonics]] (now [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]), [[San Diego Rockets]] (who moved to [[Houston]] four years later), [[Milwaukee Bucks]], and [[Phoenix Suns]].\n\nIn 1967, the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war. The NBA landed the most important college star of the era, [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] (then known as Lew Alcindor). However, the NBA's leading scorer, [[Rick Barry]], jumped to the ABA, as did four veteran referees\u2014[[Norm Drucker]], [[Earl Strom]], John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.<ref>{{cite book|last=Salzberg|first=Charles|title=From Set Shot to Slam Dunk|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8032-9250-5|page=203}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, [[Alan Siegel]], who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's [[Major League Baseball logo]] a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB's. It incorporates the silhouette of [[Jerry West]], based on a photo by Wen Roberts. The NBA would not confirm that a particular player was used because, according to Siegel, \"They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. It's become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they don't necessarily want to identify it with one player.\" The iconic logo debuted in 1971 (with a small change to the typeface on the NBA wordmark in 2017) and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Jerry|title=That iconic NBA silhouette can be traced back to him|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/27/sports/la-sp-crowe-20100427|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429022209/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/27/sports/la-sp-crowe-20100427|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 29, 2010|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 27, 2010|access-date=May 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including [[Julius Erving]] of the [[Virginia Squires]], in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates. The NBA expanded rapidly during this period. From 1966 to 1974, the NBA grew from nine franchises to 18. In 1970, the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and [[Buffalo Braves]] (now the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]) all made their debuts expanding the league to 17.<ref>{{cite web|title=1970\u201371 SEASON OVERVIEW|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19701971.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|access-date=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119020355/http://www.nba.com/history/season/19701971.html|archive-date=November 19, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The New Orleans Jazz (now in [[Utah Jazz|Utah]]) came aboard in 1974 bringing the total to 18.

Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the [[NBA G League]]. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.\n\nDuring the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the [[strength of schedule]] will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the [[National Football League|NFL]] or [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).\n\nThe NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day.<ref name=Christmas>{{cite news|last=Schuhmann|first=John|title=Knicks, Kobe and more part of Christmas Day lore|url=http://www.nba.com/2009/news/features/john_schuhmann/12/17/numbers.christmas/index.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=December 17, 2009|access-date=December 27, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202114508/http://www.nba.com/2009/news/features/john_schuhmann/12/17/numbers.christmas/index.html|archive-date=December 2, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The league has been playing [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|games]] regularly on the holiday since 1947,<ref name=ChristmasMatchups>{{cite news|title=Christmas Tradition|newspaper=The Riverside (Ca.)

Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the top vote-getters in each conference are named captains. Fan votes determine the rest of the allstar starters. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, the top vote-getters in each conference draft their own team from a player pool of allstars. The top vote-getter in the league earns first pick and so forth. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a [[NBA All-Star Game MVP|Game MVP award]]. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the [[Rising Stars Challenge]] (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the [[NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge|Skills Challenge]], where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the [[Three Point Contest]], where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals in a given time; and the [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.\n\nShortly after the All-Star break is the [[trade deadline]], which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NBA Trading Deadline Trades Since 1987|url=http://www.nba.com/history/deadline_deals.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|access-date=January 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109033255/http://www.nba.com/history/deadline_deals.html|archive-date=November 9, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for [[List of National Basketball Association general managers|general managers]].\n\nAround the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, postseason teams. The [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award|Sixth Man of the Year Award]] is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The [[NBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player Award]] is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year Award]] is awarded to the league's best defender. The [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|Coach of the Year Award]] is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, ''[[Sporting News]]'' awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year Award]] to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.\n\nThe postseason teams are the [[All-NBA Team]], the [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive Team]], and the [[NBA All-Rookie Team|All-Rookie Team]]; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.<ref>{{cite web |title=Year-by-year NBA All-Rookie Teams |url=https://www.nba.com/news/history-all-rookie-teams |website=NBA.com |access-date=December 27, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Year-by-year NBA All-Defensive Teams |url=https://www.nba.com/news/history-all-defensive-team |website=NBA.com |access-date=December 27, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Playoffs==\n{{Main|NBA playoffs}}\nThe NBA playoffs begin in April after the conclusion of the regular season with the top eight teams in each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, competing for the league's championship title, the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]]. Seeds are awarded in strict order of regular season record (with a tiebreaker system used as needed).\n\nHaving a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round. The team in each series with the better record has home-court advantage, including the First Round. Before the league changed its playoff determination format for the 2006\u201307 season, this meant that, for example, if the team that received the sixth seed had a better record than the team with the third seed (by virtue of a divisional championship), the sixth seed would have home-court advantage, even though the other team had a higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home-court advantage in every series it plays. For example, in 2006, the [[Denver Nuggets]] won 44 games and captured the Northwest Division and the third seed. Their opponent was the sixth-seeded [[Los Angeles Clippers]], who won 47 games and finished second in the Pacific Division. Although Denver won its much weaker division, the Clippers had a home-court advantage and won the series in 5.\n\nThe playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the first- and eighth-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the fourth- and fifth-seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the second- and seventh-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the third- and sixth-seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the [[NBA Finals]] followed a 2\u20133\u20132 pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBA owners change Finals format to 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/10/23/nba-board-of-governors-format-change.ap|agency=Associated Press|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=October 23, 2013|access-date=April 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515022449/http://www.nba.com/2013/news/10/23/nba-board-of-governors-format-change.ap/|archive-date=May 15, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the [[NBA Finals]] and is held annually in June. The winner of the NBA Finals receives the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]]. Each player and major contributor\u2014including coaches and the general manager\u2014on the winning team receive a championship ring. In addition, the league awards the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]] to the best performing player of the series.\n\nThe league began using its current format, with the top eight teams in each conference advancing regardless of divisional alignment, in the 2015\u201316 season. Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBA to seed playoff teams in each conference by record|url=http://www.nba.com/2015/news/09/08/nba-playoff-seeding-change-ap.ap/|agency=Associated Press|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=September 8, 2015|access-date=July 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Championships==\n{{Main|List of NBA champions}}\nThe [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Boston Celtics]] have won the most championships with each having 17 [[NBA Finals]] wins.

National Basketball Association broadcasters}}\nAs one of the major sports leagues in North America, the NBA has a long history of partnerships with television networks in the United States. The NBA signed a contract with [[DuMont Television Network]] in its eighth season, the [[1953-54 NBA season|1953\u201354 season]], marking the first year the NBA had a national television broadcaster. Similar to the [[National Football League]], the lack of television stations led to [[NBC]] taking over the rights from the [[1954-55 NBA season|1954\u201355 season]] until April 7, 1962\u2013NBC's first tenure with the NBA. Currently in the U.S., the NBA has a contract with [[ESPN]] (and [[American Broadcast Company|ABC]]) and [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] through the 2024\u201325 season. Games that are not broadcast nationally are usually aired over [[regional sports network]]s specific to the area where the teams are located.\n\n==International competitions==\nThe National Basketball Association has sporadically participated in international club competitions. From 1987 to 1999 an NBA team played against championship club teams from Asia, Europe and South America in the [[McDonald's Championship]]. This tournament was won by the NBA invitee every year it was held.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/olybb/news/story?id=3754278 |title=New club basketball championship to debut in 2010 |date=December 9, 2008 |publisher=ESPN |access-date=June 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Ticket prices and viewership demographics==\nIn 2022, an average ticket cost $77.75.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-05-08 |title=Team Market Report Publishes NBA Fan Cost Index; Slight Increase Reported |url=https://sportslawexpert.com/2022/05/08/team-market-report-publishes-nba-fan-cost-index-slight-increase-reported/ |access-date=2022-10-01 |website=Sports Law Expert}}</ref> Depending on the market and stage of the season\u2014preseason, regular season, postseason\u2014a ticket can range from $10 to $70,000.{{Efn|During the [[2019 NBA Finals]] between the [[Toronto Raptors]] and [[Golden State Warriors]], two courtside tickets were sold for $69,287.21 each at [[Oracle Arena]].}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=May |first=Jeffrey |date=2021-11-24 |title=How much are NBA tickets?
