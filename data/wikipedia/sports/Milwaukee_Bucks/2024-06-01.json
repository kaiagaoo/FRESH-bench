Abdul-Jabbar and Antetokounmpo have been named the NBA's [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] while playing for the Bucks, for a total of five MVP awards. They both are also the only players to win [[NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]] for the franchise.

In October, the Bucks played their first NBA regular-season game against the [[Chicago Bulls]] before a [[Milwaukee Arena]] crowd of 8,467. As is typical with expansion teams, the Bucks' first season ([[1968\u201369 NBA season|1968\u201369]]) was a struggle. Their first victory came in their sixth game as the Bucks beat the [[Detroit Pistons]] 134\u2013118; they won only 26 more games in their first year. That year, the Bucks' record earned them a coin flip against their expansion cousins, the [[Phoenix Suns]], to see who would get the first pick in the upcoming draft. It was considered a foregone conclusion that the first pick in the draft would be [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Lew Alcindor]] of [[UCLA]]. The Bucks won the coin flip, but had to win a bidding war with the [[Brooklyn Nets|New York Nets]] of the upstart [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) to secure him.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/it-took-a-hustler-a-native-son-a-priests-blessing-and-a-city-hungry-for-sports-to-bring-the-bucks-to-milwaukee/ar-AALO4xT|title = It took a hustler, a native son, a priest's blessing and a city hungry for sports to bring the Bucks to Milwaukee|website = [[MSN]]|access-date = November 19, 2021|archive-date = November 19, 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211119145122/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/it-took-a-hustler-a-native-son-a-priests-blessing-and-a-city-hungry-for-sports-to-bring-the-bucks-to-milwaukee/ar-AALO4xT|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n===1969\u20131975: The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar era===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 150\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 1974.jpeg\n| image2 = Oscar Robertson Bucks.jpeg\n| caption1 = During his six seasons with the Bucks, [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] averaged 30.4 points and 15.3 rebounds per game.\n| caption2 = [[Oscar Robertson]] was a key member of the Championship-winning [[1970\u201371 Milwaukee Bucks season|1970\u201371 Milwaukee Bucks]]\n| caption_align = center\n| footer = \n| footer_align = centre\n| alt1 = \n}}\n\nWith the addition of Alcindor, the Bucks finished with a 56\u201326 record in [[1969\u201370 NBA season|1969\u201370]], second-best in the league behind the [[New York Knicks]]. Not only was this a near-reversal of their inaugural season, but the 29-game improvement was the best in league history \u2013 a record which would stand for ten years until the [[Boston Celtics]] jumped from 29 wins in [[1978\u201379 NBA season|1978\u201379]] to 61 in [[1979\u201380 NBA season|1979\u201380]]. The Bucks defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in five games in the Eastern Conference semifinals, only to be dispatched in five by the Knicks in the Eastern finals. Alcindor was a runaway selection for [[NBA Rookie of the Year]].\n\n[[1970\u201371 NBA season|The following season]], the Bucks traded for [[Cincinnati Royals]] guard [[Oscar Robertson]] to complement Alcindor. Subsequently, the Bucks, now in the Western Conference, finished 66\u201316, the second-most wins in NBA history at the time, and still a franchise record. During the regular season, the Bucks recorded a then-NBA record [[List of National Basketball Association longest winning streaks|20-game win streak]]. Posting a 12\u20132 record in the playoffs, they won their first NBA championship on April 30, 1971, by sweeping the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]] in four games. By winning the championship in only their third season, the Bucks became one of the fastest true expansion teams in North American professional sports history to win a league championship.\n\nThe Bucks remained a powerhouse for the first half of the 1970s. In 1972, Alcindor, who had already privately converted to Islam and changed his name, publicly announced his name change to [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. The Bucks reached the division/conference finals for the third year in a row, but lost to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in six games. In 1973, they recorded their third consecutive 60-win season, the first NBA team to do so, but injuries resulted in an early playoff exit. The Bucks were back in the [[1974 NBA Finals]] against the Celtics. In game six of the series, Abdul-Jabbar made his famous \"[[Hook shot|sky hook]]\" shot in a classic double-overtime victory. However, the Bucks then lost in game seven, and did not return to the NBA Finals until 2021.\n\nAs the 1974\u20131975 season began, Abdul-Jabbar suffered a hand injury and the Bucks got off to a 3\u201313 start. After his return, other injuries befell the team, sending them to the bottom of their division with a 38-44 record. When the season ended, Abdul-Jabbar announced that he no longer wished to play for the Bucks and wanted to play in a larger market, either Los Angeles or New York. After the front office was unable to convince him to stay, the Bucks obliged Abdul-Jabbar's request by trading him to the Lakers on June 16, 1975, for [[Elmore Smith]], [[Junior Bridgeman]], [[Brian Winters]], and [[David Meyers (basketball)|David Meyers]]. The trade triggered a series of events that led to a change in the team's ownership. Minority owner and cable television executive [[Jim Fitzgerald (businessman)|Jim Fitzgerald]] opposed the trade and wanted to sell his stock. Although Fitzgerald was the team's largest single shareholder, he did not own enough stock to control the team.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\n===1976\u20131979: Post-Abdul-Jabbar era; \"Green 'n Growing\"===\nAfter the deal, the Bucks had several seasons in transition, but most of these players would go on to help the team. After being sold to Fitzgerald and several partners in 1976, the Bucks would enter into another era of greatness. It began with [[Don Nelson]] who became head coach in November 1976 after [[Larry Costello]] abruptly resigned. In the 1977 draft, the Bucks had three first-round picks and drafted [[Kent Benson]], [[Marques Johnson]] and [[Ernie Grunfeld]]. Johnson would become a staple in the Bucks for years to come. Rookie [[Sidney Moncrief]] made his debut in 1979. Don Nelson went on to win two [[NBA Coach of the Year]] awards with the Bucks, both during seasons where the team won division titles, in 1983 and 1985.\n\nOn October 18, 1977, Abdul-Jabbar, playing with the Lakers, punched Benson during a game. Abdul-Jabbar broke his hand in the process.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walton Injury Opens Door for Bullets|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19771978.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314045723/http://www.nba.com/history/season/19771978.html|archive-date=March 14, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Benson had been aggressive under the boards and Abdul-Jabbar, a [[martial arts]] [[blackbelt (martial arts)|blackbelt]], snapped. Abdul-Jabbar was fined $5,000 by the NBA and missed the next 20 games. Meanwhile, Benson never played as aggressively again and the Bucks traded him to the [[Detroit Pistons]] in 1980 for veteran center [[Bob Lanier]] to fill in the hole left by the departure of Abdul-Jabbar. They then won the [[Midwest Division (NBA)|Midwest Division]] title in 1980. After losing to Seattle in the semi-finals, the Bucks moved to the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]]'s [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]].\n\n===1979\u20131990: The Sidney Moncrief era===\nThere, they would win six straight division titles and have .500 seasons for the next 11 years. Within those years, the Bucks became perennial Eastern Conference contenders, primarily due to the strong play of Moncrief, [[Marques Johnson]], [[Paul Pressey]], [[Junior Bridgeman]] and the arrival of [[Craig Hodges]], [[Terry Cummings]], [[Ricky Pierce]] and [[Jack Sikma]] from trades with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and [[Seattle SuperSonics]] respectively. However, the Bucks were unable to make it to the NBA Finals again, being eliminated by either the Celtics or the [[Philadelphia 76ers|Sixers]] each time.\n\nFor much of the 1970s, the Bucks' colors were forest green, deep red and white. In 1978, they added various shades of green to the uniforms, and in 1985, they eliminated red from the team colors.\n\nNoteworthy for the 1980s Bucks is that in [[1983 NBA playoffs|1983]] they became the first, and until [[2003 NBA playoffs|2003]], only team in NBA history to sweep the [[Boston Celtics]] in a best-of-seven playoff series, being the first team to meet and defeat [[Michael Jordan]] in [[1985 NBA playoffs|a playoff series]] (during Jordan's rookie year), and hosting [[Julius Erving]]'s final NBA game in the [[1987 NBA playoffs]], which would see the Bucks advancing with a game five first-round playoff victory.\n\n====Ownership and arena changes====\nIn 1985, Fitzgerald and his partners (one of which was Stuart Shadel) decided to sell the Bucks. Fitzgerald was having health problems and some of his investors wanted to get out, and he was reeling from the failure of [[Sportsvue]], a pioneering regional sports network\u2013a failure that came in part because Milwaukee itself was not wired for cable. By then, Milwaukee Arena was the smallest arena in the NBA, and the city did not want to build a new one. Milwaukee businessman and future U.S. Senator [[Herb Kohl]] bought the Bucks after fears that out-of-town investors could buy the team and move it out of Milwaukee. Before the transaction was complete, broadcaster [[Lloyd Pettit]] and his wife, [[Jane Bradley Pettit]], announced they were donating a new arena called the [[BMO Harris Bradley Center|Bradley Center]]. In 2003, after considering selling the team, Kohl announced that he had decided against selling the Bucks to [[Michael Jordan]] and would \"continue to own them, improve them and commit them to remaining in Wisconsin\".\n\nOn May 21, 2012, the [[naming rights]] of the Bradley Center were sold to [[BMO Harris Bank]], a division of [[Bank of Montreal]]. BMO Harris had merged with Milwaukee-based [[M&I Bank]] a year earlier. After the heirs to the Bradley fortune gave their approval, the arena was renamed the \"BMO Harris Bradley Center\".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Milwaukee's Bradley Center Becomes the BMO Harris Bradley Center As Local \"Champions of the Community\" Come Forward to Support Jane Bradley Pettit's Gift|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/milwaukees-bradley-center-becomes-bmo-harris-bradley-center-local-champions-community-come-f|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=May 21, 2012|access-date=October 3, 2015|archive-date=January 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107053702/http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/milwaukees-bradley-center-becomes-bmo-harris-bradley-center-local-champions-community-come-f|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131998: The period of struggles===\nFor most of the 1990s, the Bucks franchise was mired in mediocrity under coaches [[Frank Hamblen]], [[Mike Dunleavy, Sr.|Mike Dunleavy]], and [[Chris Ford]]. They would make the playoffs only three times during the 1990s, winning only one playoff game. From 1991 through 1998, the Bucks suffered a franchise-record seven straight losing seasons. During this period, the Bucks drafted [[Glenn Robinson]] with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and in 1996 acquired rookie [[Ray Allen]] in a draft-day trade with the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. Both players would have prominent roles in the Bucks' resurgence during the late 1990s. At the [[1998 NBA draft]], the Bucks made a trade that would come back to haunt them for years. At the draft, the Bucks selected [[Dirk Nowitzki]] with the ninth overall pick, but traded him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in exchange for [[Robert Traylor]]. Many rank this as one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, as Nowitzki would go onto a 21-season career with the Mavericks, winning a championship in [[2011 NBA Finals|2011]] while being named Finals MVP in the process, along with winning the NBA MVP award in 2007. Meanwhile, Traylor would spend just two seasons with the Bucks before joining the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].\n\nAfter the franchise's 25th anniversary in 1993, the Bucks overhauled their logo and uniforms. The colors were green, purple, and silver. The old logo, which featured a cartoonish deer, was replaced in favor of a more realistic one. The primary color scheme was altered as well, when red was supplanted by purple. Purple road uniforms replaced the former green away uniforms.\n\nIn 1997, the Bucks sent all-star forward [[Vin Baker]] in a three-team trade to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], and they would acquire [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] guard [[Terrell Brandon]] and forward [[Tyrone Hill]]. They also traded their 10th overall pick [[Danny Fortson]], guard [[Johnny Newman]], and center [[Joe Wolf]] to the [[Denver Nuggets]] for center [[Ervin Johnson]]. The 1997\u201398 Bucks finished their season with a 36\u201346 record, failing to make the playoffs for the seventh consecutive time.\n\n===1998\u20132003: The Big Three era; \"Let It Fly\"===\nAfter a decade of dwelling near the bottom of the NBA's standings, the Bucks looked to add credibility to their basketball operations. In 1998, the team hired veteran coach [[George Karl]], who had reached the [[NBA Finals]] with the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. Under the leadership of Karl and general manager [[Ernie Grunfeld]], and with the steady addition of talent such as [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] and [[Sam Cassell]], the Bucks developed into an elite team in the Eastern Conference. The nucleus of the \"big three\"\u2014consisting of [[Ray Allen]], Cassell, and Robinson\u2014along with Karl, created a successful renaissance era in Milwaukee. The team reached its zenith in 2000\u20132001, winning 52 games and their first division title in 15 years. The Bucks reached the 2001 Eastern Conference Finals by defeating the Charlotte Hornets. They lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games to the 76ers. This era became known for many Bucks fans as the \"Let It Fly\" era, due to the high-scoring offense of the team, personified by the shooting of Robinson and Allen.\n\nAfter coming within one game of an NBA Finals appearance in 2001, the Bucks sought to make key off-season player additions to put the team in the NBA Finals. Behind the strong encouragement of George Karl, the Bucks acquired forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]] at the beginning of the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]]. On paper, this move made the Bucks the team to beat in the East. However, Mason battled with his weight and had a tough time finding his role.<ref>{{cite web|last=Markus|first=Don|title=Jury still out on Mason as plus/minus for Bucks|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-11-18/sports/0111180209_1_anthony-mason-milwaukee-bucks-karl|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=November 18, 2001|access-date=November 18, 2001|archive-date=April 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430002147/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-11-18/sports/0111180209_1_anthony-mason-milwaukee-bucks-karl|url-status=live}}</ref> The Bucks, who at the season's midway point were the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, went into a swoon in February and March. The collapse culminated with a loss to the [[Detroit Pistons]] on the final night of the season, which eliminated the Bucks from the playoffs and gave the division to the Pistons. The fallout created tension between Karl and the players, resulting in a trade of [[Glenn Robinson]] to Atlanta (for [[Toni Kuko\u010d]] and a 2003 first-round draft pick, used to select [[T. J. Ford]]).\n\nDuring the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]], the Bucks traded Ray Allen and backup Ronald \"Flip\" Murray to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] for [[Gary Payton]] and [[Desmond Mason]]. The trade allowed emerging star [[Michael Redd]] to see increased playing time, and with Payton in the backcourt, they finished the season with a 42\u201340 record. The Bucks made the playoffs, but lost in the first round to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in six games. That offseason, team leaders [[Sam Cassell]] and Ervin Johnson were traded to Minnesota (for [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]]). Payton left via free agency, after playing only 28 games for the Bucks. Karl's tenure also ended after the season. Within a one-year period, the team had lost the coach and players most responsible for the team's success during that era.\n[[File:Toni Kukoc.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Toni Kuko\u010d]] playing for the Bucks.]]\n\n===2003\u20132009: The Michael Redd era===\n[[File:ReddBucks.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Michael Redd playing for the Bucks.]]\nUnder the direction of new general manager [[Larry Harris (basketball)|Larry Harris]], the Bucks struggled with inconsistency and injury for the next six years. During that period, they reached the playoffs twice, first under coach [[Terry Porter]] in [[2004 NBA playoffs|2004]] and then under [[Terry Stotts]] in [[2006 NBA playoffs|2006]]. In both instances, they were defeated by the [[Detroit Pistons]] in five games.

Bogut struggled with both inconsistency and injuries in his first four years in Milwaukee, but over time became a key contributor to the Bucks.\n\nIn 2006, the team finished 40\u201342, last in their division, 24 games behind Detroit, but still made the playoffs in a season where every team in their division did. They were paired as the eighth seed versus the 64\u201318 conference-leading Pistons. They won game three at home, but lost the other four in a 4\u20131 series loss.\n\nAlso in March, the Bucks announced that they would not renew general manager [[Larry Harris (basketball)|Larry Harris]]'s contract, which was to expire in June. In April, the Bucks hired John Hammond, formerly vice-president of basketball operations for the Pistons, as their new general manager,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucks name John Hammond General Manager|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/hammond_named_general_manager_080411.html?rss=true|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=April 11, 2008|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225045344/http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/hammond_named_general_manager_080411.html?rss=true|archive-date=December 25, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> giving the Milwaukee team a fresh director recently associated with success.\n\nAlso in April, the Bucks announced that [[Larry Krystkowiak]], the third and final head coach hired by Larry Harris, had been relieved of his duties. [[Scott Skiles]], formerly of the [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Phoenix Suns]], became head coach.\n\nOn June 26, 2008, the Bucks acquired [[Richard Jefferson]] from the [[New Jersey Nets]] in a trade for 2007 first-round draft pick [[Yi Jianlian]] and [[Bobby Simmons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/draft2008/news/story?id=3462210|title=Nets send top scorer Jefferson to Bucks for Yi, Simmons|date=June 26, 2008|publisher=ESPN|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-date=October 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023172735/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/draft2008/news/story?id=3462210|url-status=live}}</ref> Later that day, the Bucks selected West Virginia's [[Joe Alexander (basketball)|Joe Alexander]] with the eighth pick of the NBA draft.

Midway through the season, Bucks' general manager [[John Hammond (basketball)|John Hammond]] traded [[Hakim Warrick]] to the [[Chicago Bulls]], and acquired [[John Salmons]]. In a Bucks uniform, Salmons averaged a team-leading 19.9 points per game. The play of Jennings, along with the improvement of Andrew Bogut, the improved [[Ersan \u0130lyasova]], and the Salmons trade, catapulted the team to be a playoff contender. At the beginning of the season, the Bucks had low playoffs expectations; they had not been in four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegasinsider.com/nba/scoreboard/previews/76ers-@-bucks.cfm/date/03-24-10|title=NBA Previews for the Philadelphia 76ers vs. Milwaukee Bucks Matchup|publisher=Vegas Insider|date=March 24, 2010|access-date=April 25, 2015|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192102/http://www.vegasinsider.com/nba/scoreboard/previews/76ers-@-bucks.cfm/date/03-24-10|url-status=live}}</ref> In October, the Bucks quickly fell behind the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in the Central Division, but Milwaukee ultimately clinched a playoff berth on April 6, 2010, with a road win over the [[Chicago Bulls]]. It was during that time that the phrase ''\"Fear the Deer\"'' started, most likely by ESPN commentator [[John Anderson (sportscaster)|John Anderson]]. It was quickly adopted on message boards and within Andrew Bogut's Squad 6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/business/89079357.html|title='Fear the Deer' is catching on|author=Don Walker|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-date=June 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626114352/http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/business/89079357.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=May 2019 |title=Where did \"Fear The Deer\" come from anyway? |url=https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/bucks-fear-the-deer-history |access-date=May 4, 2022 |website=OnMilwaukee |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605131318/https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/bucks-fear-the-deer-history |archive-date=June 5, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> The slogan rang well with Bucks fans, who started bringing signs with the phrase to games. The slogan became the team's battle cry in the NBA playoffs. The Bucks finished the regular season with a record of 46\u201336. The Bucks clinched the sixth seed and were eliminated in a seven-game series against the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. It was the farthest Milwaukee had gotten in the post-season since [[2001 NBA playoffs|2001]]. The Bucks' short playoff run was also in part due to Bogut suffering a broken arm after making an awkward fall after a dunk in a late-season game, thus ending his season. In the 2010\u201311 season, the Bucks finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, just out of reach of the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010-2011 DIVISION STANDINGS|url=http://www.nba.com/standings/2010/team_record_comparison/conferenceNew_Std_Div.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|access-date=May 16, 2013|archive-date=May 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530092257/http://www.nba.com/standings/2010/team_record_comparison/conferenceNew_Std_Div.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith Bogut sidelined for the rest of the season and [[Stephen Jackson]] and head coach [[Scott Skiles]] not seeing eye-to-eye, the Bucks decided to trade both players. On March 13, 2012, 48 hours before the trade deadline, the Bucks traded Bogut and Jackson to the [[Golden State Warriors]] in exchange for [[Monta Ellis]], [[Ekpe Udoh]], and [[Kwame Brown]].\n\nBefore the [[2012 NBA draft]], the Bucks sent a first-round pick, [[Shaun Livingston]], [[Jon Brockman]], and [[Jon Leuer]] to the Houston Rockets for a first-round pick and [[Samuel Dalembert]]. In the 2012 draft, the Bucks selected [[Doron Lamb]] and [[John Henson (basketball)|John Henson]].\n\nAfter 32 games of the 2012\u201313 season, the Bucks fired Skiles, their coach since 2008. Jim Boylan was announced as the interim head coach and led the Bucks to a 22\u201328 record to finish the season at 38\u201344. The Bucks qualified as the eighth seed, where they were quickly swept 4\u20130 by the reigning, and eventual champions, the [[Miami Heat]].\n\n===2013\u2013present: The Giannis Antetokounmpo era===\n[[File:Giannis Antetokoummpo (31669417562).jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Giannis Antetokounmpo]]]]\n\n====2013\u20132014: under Larry Drew====\n[[Jim Boylan]] was relieved of his coaching duties and ex-Atlanta Hawks coach [[Larry Drew]] was hired. On June 27, 2013, the Bucks chose Greek forward [[Giannis Antetokounmpo]] with the 15th overall pick of the [[2013 NBA draft]]. They also brought in [[O. J. Mayo]], [[Carlos Delfino]], [[Zaza Pachulia]], and [[Gary Neal]] as well as seeing [[Monta Ellis]] opt-out of the final year of his contract. The Bucks also agreed to sign-and-trade Brandon Jennings to the [[Detroit Pistons]] in exchange for [[Brandon Knight (basketball)|Brandon Knight]], [[Khris Middleton]], and [[Viacheslav Kravtsov]]. The Bucks later extended their contract with [[Larry Sanders (basketball)|Larry Sanders]] with a four-year, $44 million contract and traded [[Ish Smith]] and Kravtsov to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for [[Caron Butler]]. By the start of the 2013\u201314 season, the Bucks only had four players on their roster from the previous season. The season itself was a struggle, as the Bucks finished with the worst record in the league at 15\u201367, the worst record in team history.\n\nOn April 16, 2014, long-time Bucks owner Herb Kohl agreed to sell a majority interest of the team to New York-based billionaires [[Wes Edens]], and [[Marc Lasry]] for $550 million, but Kohl retained a significant minority interest in the team.

The Bucks then went on a stretch from January 24 to February 20, where they went 10\u20132. The Bucks beat the Sacramento Kings on February 11 for their 30th win of the year, and also became the first-ever NBA team to double their win total from the previous season before the All-Star Break.\n\nOff the court, the Bucks made several changes to their roster, releasing Larry Sanders after several off-court incidents that led to multiple suspensions. On February 19, in the final minutes of the trade deadline, the Bucks became part of a 3-way deal with the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns, sending Brandon Knight, who was in the final year of his contract, to the Suns, and receiving reigning Rookie of the Year [[Michael Carter-Williams]], [[Miles Plumlee]], and [[Tyler Ennis (basketball)|Tyler Ennis]]. The Bucks also lost expected superstar Jabari Parker to a season-ending knee injury on December 15 in a game against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nOn January 25, the NBA passed the '[[Jay-Z]] Rule', prohibiting ownership groups from consisting of more than 25 individuals, and also mandating that no ownership interest in a team be smaller than 1%.

When the 2016\u201317 season began, the Bucks were without Khris Middleton, who suffered a torn hamstring during a practice. Even so, the Bucks remained competitive, staying around .500 for the first half of the season, with both Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker leading the offense. While Parker missed making the All-Star team, Giannis was voted in as a starter, becoming the first Bucks All-Star since Michael Redd in 2004. In January, the Bucks slumped, though fans anticipated a turnaround with Middleton's return on February 8 against the Miami Heat. In the same game, however, Parker tore his ACL for the second time in 3 seasons, ending his season. Even so, Middleton's return still sparked a turnaround in March. During the month, the Bucks went 14\u20134, putting the team back in the thick of the playoff race. On April 8, 2017, the Bucks beat the Philadelphia 76ers 90\u201382, clinching the Bucks a playoff spot. On April 10, the Bucks beat the Charlotte Hornets 89\u201379 to clinch only the third winning season for the Bucks since 2001.

The word \"Bango\" was originally coined by [[Eddie Doucette]], the longtime play-by-play announcer for the Bucks. Doucette used the word whenever a Bucks player connected on a long-range basket. It was often used for sharpshooter [[Jon McGlocklin]]. When it came time for the Bucks to choose a name for their new mascot, the name \"Bango\" won the contest.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Adam |title=Milwaukee Bucks History: The Bango Origin Story |url=https://behindthebuckpass.com/2016/09/14/milwaukee-bucks-history-bango-origin-story/ |website=behindthebuckpass.com |access-date=October 29, 2018 |date=September 14, 2016 |archive-date=October 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030090903/https://behindthebuckpass.com/2016/09/14/milwaukee-bucks-history-bango-origin-story/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nBango has been the Bucks' official mascot since October 18, 1977, which was Milwaukee's home opener of the [[1977\u201378 NBA season|1977\u201378 season]]. In addition to the date being Bango's home debut, the game itself pitted Milwaukee against former Bucks center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and his [[Los Angeles Lakers]] at the [[Milwaukee Arena]]. Bango's original outfit only consisted of a green wool sweater with a \"B\" on the front, similar to the buck featured on the team logo. Since the 1990s, Bango now wears a Bucks uniform with the number 68, referring to the franchise's inaugural season of 1968. Bango has worked hard to become popular with Bucks fans throughout the state of Wisconsin over the years, appearing at schools, parades, and festivals as a goodwill ambassador for the team. His high-flying acrobatic layups, daring rebounds, and other entertaining antics still play an important role in energizing Bucks fans at the [[Fiserv Forum]]. Since 2001, Bango has also made perennial appearances at the [[NBA All-Star Game]].\n\nAt the 2009 All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, Arizona, Bango suffered an injury during a mascot-participative skit. While standing on one basket's rim, Bango's right leg slipped through the hoop, and he fell on the rim. He then slipped further and fell through the basket entirely. Bango tore his ACL due to the fall and was unable to perform for the remainder of the 2008\u201309 season, periodically making appearances at games in a wheelchair. A video of Bango's injury at the 2009 Mascot Challenge was uploaded onto [[YouTube]] shortly after the incident occurred.<ref name=\"bucky\">Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/f_VdySnHsJY Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090308100742/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_VdySnHsJY Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_VdySnHsJY|title=NBA mascot hits halfcourt shot off another mascot|via=YouTube|date=February 18, 2009|access-date=May 16, 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nDuring game four of the 2009\u201310 [[2010 NBA Playoffs#(3) Atlanta Hawks vs. (6) Milwaukee Bucks|first-round playoff series between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Atlanta Hawks]], Bango successfully performed a back-flip dunk from the top of a 16-foot ladder, a feat similar to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]' mascot [[Squatch]]'s feat during a March 19, 2008, game between the [[SuperSonics]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]].\n\nBango has also dunked the ball while in a human hamster wheel in 2012 and made a behind-the-back half-court shot in New Orleans at the NBA All-Star game.  In 2010 Bango was named Mascot of the Year, and later in 2011 was awarded, Most Awesome Mascot\", by Cartoon Network. Bango has also made many television appearances. He appeared in an ESPN commercial with Brandon Jennings in 2011, and then appeared in another ESPN commercial with Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2018. In 2013, Bango was featured on a Hulu original documentary series called, ''Behind the Mask''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nba.com/bucks/entertainment/bango|title=Bango|website=Milwaukee Bucks|language=en|access-date=April 3, 2020|archive-date=May 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200522182656/https://www.nba.com/bucks/entertainment/bango|url-status=live}}</ref> This documentary featured the trials and tribulations of sports mascots.

The white uniform featured \"Bucks\" in green serifed letters with red trim and block numbers, while the green uniform has \"Milwaukee\" in white serifed letters with red trim. Both sets have the deer head logo on the left leg. The Bucks would bring back the green uniform in the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]], and the white uniform in the [[2017\u201318 NBA season|2017\u201318 season]] as part of the league's \"Classic\" uniform series.\n\nPrior to the [[1971\u201372 NBA season|1971\u201372 season]], the letters on the white uniform changed to red with green trim, with \"Bucks\" now taking a block letter style. They kept the original green uniform until 1973, when it was modified to feature a script \"Milwaukee\" in red with white trim and numbers below the left chest. Both sets removed the deer head logo on the shorts.\n\nIn the [[1975\u201376 NBA season|1975\u201376 season]], the Bucks' white uniform changed to feature a script \"Bucks\" lettering and numbers on the left chest. The green uniform brought back the block \"Milwaukee\" lettering and centered numbers but kept the red base and white trim. The striping on the shorts was also modified.\n\n===1977\u20131993===\nCoinciding with the debut of [[Robert Indiana]]'s iconic [[UW\u2013Milwaukee Panther Arena|MECCA]] court in the [[1977\u201378 NBA season|1977\u201378 season]], the Bucks redesigned their uniforms. It now featured side stripes of kelly, lime and hunter green (a.k.a. the \"Irish Rainbows\"). Both the hunter green and white uniforms featured the streamlined \"Bucks\" lettering from the team logo and block lettering. They removed the color red prior to the [[1985\u201386 NBA season|1985\u201386 season]], while lime green was promoted to accent color.\n\n===1993\u20132006===\nThe Bucks changed their logo and uniforms for the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]]. Green was relegated to trim color in favor of purple, while silver was added as an accent color. The original white uniform featured the letters in green with silver and purple trim, while the purple uniform featured letters in white with green and silver trim. In the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]], the uniforms were tweaked to include the alternate antler logo on the waist along with extended side stripes. Letters on the purple uniform were now silver with green and white trim. The purple uniform from this era would be reused in the [[2022\u201323 NBA season|2022\u201323 season]] as part of the \"Classic\" edition series.\n\n{| align=right\n|{{Basketball kit\n| align = right\n| pattern_b = _milwaukeebucks90s_road\n| pattern_s = _milwaukeebucks90s_road\n| body = ffffff\n| shorts = ffffff\n| title = 1995\u201399 Uniform\n}}\n|}\n\nIn the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]] the Bucks unveiled a hunter green alternate uniform. The script \"Bucks\" lettering was in white fading to silver and purple and numbers were in white with green and purple trim. The uniform featured the graphic [[deer]] logo on the right side. They were retired after the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]]. It would be resurrected for the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]] during Hardwood Classics Nights, to updated uniform standards.\n\nAccording to former NBA creative director Tom O'Grady, the Bucks' purple and green color scheme was inspired by a mysterious [[FedEx]] package that O'Grady received in 1992, containing a dark green cap and purple shirt with the logo of the [[Wimbledon Championships]], and a handwritten letter by then-Bucks general manager [[Mike Dunleavy Sr.]]\n\n===2006\u20132015===\n[[File:BucksWordmark.png|right|thumb|150px|Milwaukee Bucks wordmark, 2006\u20132015.]]\nThe uniforms were changed again for the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]]. The new home uniform was white with [[hunter green]] stripes on the sides. Inside each green stripe is a thinner red stripe that splits into two stripes near the shoulders. The numbers are green with a red outline. Milwaukee had two road uniforms as part of this set. The primary one was hunter green and a similar design to the home uniform with white numbers with a silver highlight and red outline. Both uniforms jerseys said \"BUCKS\" across the chest in beveled block letters, the 'B' and 'S' slightly larger than the rest of the letters. A secondary road uniform was introduced in the [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309 season]]. Consisting of red jersey and shorts, it was made to resemble the 1968\u201373 uniforms. It says \"Milwaukee\" in white and silver writing, along with the numbers. The uniform set was tweaked for the [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2014\u201315 season]], with the addition of a gold tab commemorating their 1971 championship and the move of the NBA logo to the back. The 'Bucks' lettering was tweaked to make all the letters the same height.\n\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, hints were made by the Bucks that their logo and uniforms were going to be redesigned. For one home game, it was anticipated that new uniforms were going to be revealed with [[Safety orange|hunter orange]] replacing red as the secondary color. It turned out to be an April Fool's joke, though the Bucks did announce that a new logo and colors would be revealed on April 13, 2015.<ref name=\"BucksIdentity\" />\n\n===2015\u2013present===\nOn April 13, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled new primary and secondary logos, as well as a new color scheme. The new branding will take effect beginning with the 2015\u201316 NBA season. The Bucks' new official colors are Good Land green (a reference to \"Milwaukee\" being supposedly based on an Algonquian word meaning \"The Good Land\"), Cream City cream (based on Milwaukee's old nickname of \"the [[Cream City brick|Cream City]]\", which came from the cream-colored bricks that were used for constructing many of Milwaukee's buildings back during the late 19th century), Great Lakes blue, black, and white.<ref name=\"BucksIdentity\" />\n\n[[File:Milwaukee Bucks wordmark 2015-current.png|right|thumb|150px|Milwaukee Bucks wordmark, 2015\u2013present.]]\n\nOn June 6, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled their new home and road uniforms, to be worn beginning with the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]]. The new uniforms remained white at home and green on the road, but red is now replaced by cream. The 'Milwaukee' city name also returned to the road uniforms for the first time since 1976. In addition, the jerseys feature a unique color block pattern on the sides, titled the \"Cream City Rainbow\". The pattern consists of the team's new colors of green, cream, royal blue and black, which the Bucks described as an homage to the \"Irish Rainbow\" design of the 1980s. Blue was also included inside the collar, representing Milwaukee and Wisconsin's \"blue collar\" citizens, while the inscription \"Fear the Deer\" was written on the bottom left upside down. The back collar features a small gold tab above the NBA logo, commemorating the Bucks' [[1971 NBA Finals|1971]] and [[2021 NBA Finals|2021]] NBA championships.<ref>{{cite press release|title=BUCKS UNVEIL NEW HOME AND ROAD UNIFORMS|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-unveil-new-home-and-road-uniforms|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=June 6, 2015|access-date=October 4, 2015|archive-date=October 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021232946/http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-unveil-new-home-and-road-uniforms|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New Uniforms|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/uniforms|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=June 6, 2015|access-date=October 4, 2015|archive-date=October 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001113457/http://www.nba.com/bucks/Uniforms|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn October 3, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled a new black alternate uniform.

In conjunction with the unveiling of the uniform, dubbed the \"Fear the Deer uniform\", the team also unveiled a new alternate court design, a first in NBA history. The team planned to wear the black alternate uniform and play on the alternate court design for at least four home games during the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Bucks Announce 'Fear the Deer' Nights Featuring Alternate Uniforms and an Alternate Court|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-announce-fear-deer-nights-featuring-alternate-uniforms-and-alternate-court|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=October 3, 2015|access-date=October 5, 2015|archive-date=October 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005015845/http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-announce-fear-deer-nights-featuring-alternate-uniforms-and-alternate-court|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's new protocol for uniforms, with each team allotted 5 different uniform sets, the Bucks added to their regular home (now \"Association\" white) and road (now \"Icon\" green) uniforms, as well as their alternate black (\"Statement\") uniforms. For their retro uniform, the Bucks went with a replica version of their inaugural home uniforms from 1968 to 1970, as part of the Bucks celebrating their 50th season in the NBA. In addition, the Bucks were also given new \"City\" uniforms, conceived by Nike as a way of commemorating each of the NBA teams' city history and pride. The \"City\" uniforms, dubbed \"Cream City\" uniforms, featured cream-colored jerseys and shorts, with the \"Cream City Rainbow\" running horizontally along the front of the uniform, with the Bucks logo in the middle. The \"Cream City Rainbow\" was also on the shorts, shaped in an \"M\" on both sides that are part of the regular Bucks' uniform design.\n\nFor the 2018\u201319 season, Milwaukee's \"City\" uniform will pay homage to Robert Indiana's famous MECCA court, featuring yellow, beige and red as base colors and light blue and forest green on the hem of the shorts. \"Bucks\" is written vertically on the right while the number is on the left; both are in forest green with lime green trim. The Bucks would also wear an \"Earned\" uniform by virtue of qualifying in the 2018 playoffs; this uniform is essentially the \"City\" uniform but with the visual elements of red with green stripes, inspired from the 1977\u20131985 \"Irish Rainbow\" home uniform.\n\nThe Bucks made slight updates to the black \"Statement\" uniform prior to the 2019\u201320 season. It was essentially a black version of the team's 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniform, with the exception of the \"Fear the Deer\" insignia on the beltline and near the jock tag.\n\nThe Bucks' 2019\u201320 \"City\" uniform again used a cream base, this time with a stylized \"Cream City\" wordmark in front. Blue, cream and green stripes run through the piping while a giant \"M\" insignia is featured on the shorts. These uniforms are a nod to the team\u2019s fondness of the cream-colored brick buildings which surround the city of Milwaukee.\n\nThe 2020\u201321 Bucks \"City\" uniform used three shades of Great Lakes Blue as its base color. The uniform was a nod to Milwaukee's meaning as \"the gathering place by the water\" due to the city's location at the confluence of the [[Milwaukee River|Milwaukee]], [[Menomonee River|Menomonee]] and [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River tributary)|Kinnickinnic]] rivers flowing into [[Lake Michigan]].\n\nAs in 2019, the Bucks were given an \"Earned\" uniform after making the [[2020 NBA playoffs|2020 playoffs]]. This design, with a predominantly green base, featured \"Bucks,\" the uniform number and piping in white with black trim, and stylized antlers on each side.\n\nThe 2021\u201322 Bucks \"City\" uniform combined different elements of each of the Bucks' different uniform designs during their history, as part of the NBA's 75th season celebration. The jersey is white, with arched block letters, similar to their first uniforms. The sides featured the different shades of green from the team's \"Irish Rainbow\" uniform, as well as one line of blue from their current \"Cream City Rainbow\". Down the rest of the side of the jersey is purple, from the team's uniforms of the late 1990s, early 2000s.\n\nStarting with the 2022\u201323 season, the green \"Earned\" uniform worn in 2021 became the basis of the team's new black \"Statement\" uniform. Also during the season, the Bucks' \"City\" uniform paid homage to the Bronzeville neighborhood, featuring a blue base, cream trim and rainbow side stripes of black, blue, cream and green. The team chose replicas of their 2000\u201301 purple road uniforms for their \"Classic\" uniform.\n\nFor the 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform, the Bucks wore a blue-based uniform with cream and green accents; the cream curving stripes surrounding the blue \"Milwaukee\" wordmark were meant to represent the Fiserv Forum architecture. The design was inspired by the fans that flood the neighborhood in Deer District, and were represented by light blue speckles.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n''List of the last five seasons completed by the Bucks.

Bucks games produced by Bally Sports are also carried on the [[Bally Sports app]] within the team's broadcast territory.\n\nPrior to the Bally Sports Wisconsin exclusivity, the Bucks split their television broadcasts between Fox Sports Wisconsin (which through various incarnations have televised Bucks games since 1996) and [[WVTV-DT2|WCGV]] (Channel 24) from 1999 to 2007, and prior that, [[WVTV]] (Channel 18) was the over-the-air partner from 1994 to 1999. WCGV also previously carried Bucks games from 1988 to 1994, and WVTV again, this time from 1976 to 1988; these two stations are currently owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], who also own [[Bally Sports]]. During each station's tenures as the over-the-air TV home of the Bucks, the telecasts consisted of almost exclusively road games; very few Bucks home games on either station were televised through the years, as the Bucks were one of the last NBA teams to televise home games regularly. The Bucks, along with their respective TV partners, co-produced and distributed the over-the-air telecasts to stations throughout Wisconsin.\n\nIn the franchise's early years, Bucks games were carried on then-[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WITI-TV|WITI]] (Channel 6), from 1968 to 1971, and on then-[[CBS]] affiliate [[WISN-TV]] (Channel 12) from 1971 to 1976; both respective runs also coincided with NBA coverage already carried by their networks at the time: [[NBA on ABC|ABC]] (1965\u20131973) and [[NBA on CBS|CBS]] (1973\u20131990). The two stations swapped networks in March 1977, with WISN since remaining with ABC, and WITI switching from CBS to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in December 1994.\n\nUntil his 2021 retirement, [[Jim Paschke]] was the team's television play-by-play announcer since 1986, with former Buck [[Jon McGlocklin]] providing [[color commentary]] for the team from 1976 to 2018. From 2015 to 2018, veteran announcer [[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]] called selected games alongside Paschke on a rotating basis. During that time, former Buck [[Marques Johnson]] also was in the booth for selected games, but became the new permanent color commentator for the 2018\u201319 season when the team moved to the [[Fiserv Forum]]. Veteran sportscaster [[Eddie Doucette]] served as the team's original play-by-play voice, working in that capacity from 1968 to 1984; he also called selected Bucks games on WITI, WISN-TV, and during most of WVTV's first tenure with the Bucks. He and McGlocklin also co-founded the [[MACC Fund|Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer (MACC) Fund]] in 1976, which raises money to help cancer research. In 2021, the team named [[Lisa Byington]] as their new television play-by-play announcer, making her the first woman to be the lead TV play-by-play announcer for a team in any of the four men's professional leagues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milwaukee Bucks Name Lisa Byington as Television Play-By-Play Announcer|url=https://www.nba.com/bucks/news/milwaukee-bucks-name-lisa-byington-television-play-play-announcer|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=September 15, 2021|access-date=September 15, 2021|archive-date=September 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210915204032/https://www.nba.com/bucks/news/milwaukee-bucks-name-lisa-byington-television-play-play-announcer|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn the radio side the team has been carried by [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] (620/103.3) and throughout the state on the [[Milwaukee Bucks Radio Network]] (which is sponsored by BMO Harris) for most of the team's history.
