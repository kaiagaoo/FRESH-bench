The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as N\u00fa\u00f1ez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Rom\u00e1rio]] and [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] rather than meeting their demands.<ref name=\"fcbarcelona4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_4.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121204143800/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_4.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 December 2012 |title=History part IV |publisher=FC Barcelona |access-date=15 March 2010 }}</ref><ref>Ball, Phil p. 85</ref>\n\nOn 16 May 1979, the club won its first [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] by beating [[Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf]] 4\u20133 in [[Basel]] in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling ''blaugrana'' fans.

The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in [[skinheads]], who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from [[liberalism]] to [[fascism]], which caused division within the group and a sudden support for N\u00fa\u00f1ez's presidency.<ref>Spaaij, Ram\u00f3n pp. 291\u2013292</ref> Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.<ref>Spaaij, Ram\u00f3n p. 293</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], Barcelona signed the English top scorer [[Gary Lineker]], along with goalkeeper [[Andoni Zubizarreta]], but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team.

Retrieved 29 August 2010.</ref> During the dictatorships of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and especially [[Francoist Spain|Francisco Franco]], all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto ''M\u00e9s que un club'' (''English: More than a club'') because of its alleged connection to [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]] as well as to [[progressivism|progressive]] beliefs.<ref>Ball, Phil p. 88</ref>\n\nThere's an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939\u201375) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid|Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n]] and [[Real Madrid CF|Madrid FC]] (that recovered its ''royal'' name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed ''CF Barcelona'' succeed as \"Spanish team\" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid weren't particularly successful, winning two [[Copa del Rey|Copa del General\u00edsimo]] titles and a [[Copa Eva Duarte]]; Barcelona claimed three [[List of Spanish football champions|league titles]], one Copa del General\u00edsimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11\u20131 home win against Barcelona in the [[1943 Copa del General\u00edsimo|Copa del General\u00edsimo]], where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of [[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]] to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u (footballer)|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]]'s \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernab\u00e9u, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Franco's forces]], saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.realmadrid.com/en/about-real-madrid/history/presidents/santiago-bernabeu|title=SANTIAGO BERNAB\u00c9U 1943\u00b71978|work=Real Madrid C.F.|publisher=realmadrid.com|access-date=1 July 2022|archive-date=16 August 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220816230029/https://www.realmadrid.com/en/about-real-madrid/history/presidents/santiago-bernabeu|url-status=live}}</ref> These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. [[Fernando Maria Castiella]], who served as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Spain)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had.\" Franco died in 1975, and the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] soon followed. Under his rule, [[List of Real Madrid CF records and statistics#Honours|Real Madrid had won]] 14 league titles, 6 Copa del General\u00edsimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 [[Latin Cup]]s and 1 [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]].

Di St\u00e9fano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for [[Club Deportivo Los Millonarios|Los Millionarios]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Colombia]], during a players' strike in his native [[Argentina]]. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di St\u00e9fano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Mu\u00f1oz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di St\u00e9fano play the 1953\u201354 and 1955\u201356 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954\u201355 and 1956\u201357 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di St\u00e9fano moved to ''Los Blancos'', signing a four-year contract.

On November 28, 1988, in celebration of the club's centenary, the song was performed by Catalan singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat at the end of the festival at the Camp Nou stadium. Since the 2008\u201309 season, \"Cant del Bar\u00e7a\" has been featured on the official Barcelona jerseys.\n\nEl Cant del Bar\u00e7a is turned on before Barcelona games take place at the Camp Nou, especially during matches against Real Madrid and just before the start of the meeting. The song is also often played for supporters and fans to cheer, chant and celebrate the victory.\n\n== Stadium ==\n{{Main|Camp de la Ind\u00fastria|Camp de Les Corts|Camp Nou}}\n\n[[File:LesCortes1939.jpg|left|thumb|[[Camp de Les Corts]] in 1939.

After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950.
