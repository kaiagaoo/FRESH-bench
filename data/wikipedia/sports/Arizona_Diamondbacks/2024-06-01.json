The Diamondbacks compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member of the [[National League (baseball)|National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West Division]]. The franchise was established on March 9, 1995, and began play in [[1998 Major League Baseball expansion|1998]] as an [[expansion team]]. The team plays its home games at [[Chase Field]]. Along with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], the Diamondbacks are one of the newest teams in MLB and are the youngest team to win the [[World Series]].\n\nAfter a fifth-place finish in their inaugural season, the Diamondbacks made several off-season acquisitions, including future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Randy Johnson]], who won four consecutive [[Cy Young Award]]s in his first four seasons with the team. In [[1999 Arizona Diamondbacks season|1999]], Arizona won 100 games and their first division championship. In [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2001]], they won the [[2001 World Series|World Series]] over the three-time defending champion New York Yankees, becoming the fastest expansion team in major league history to win the World Series and the first and only [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|men's major professional sports team]] in the State of Arizona to win a championship. \n\nFrom 1998 to 2023, the Diamondbacks have an overall record of {{Win\u2013loss record|w=1,998|l=2,112}} ({{winpct|1,998|2,112}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Arizona Diamondbacks Team History & Encyclopedia |url=https://www.baseballreference.com/teams/ARI/index.shtml |website=Baseball Reference |access-date=May 27, 2020 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main article|History of the Arizona  Diamondbacks}}\n{{See also|1998 Major League Baseball expansion}}\n\nOn March 9, 1995, Phoenix was awarded an expansion franchise to begin play for the {{mlby|1998}} season. A $130 million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball and on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were voted into the National League.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baseball Expansion Teams Put in Leagues|date=January 17, 1997|newspaper=Southeastern Missourian}}</ref> The Diamondbacks' first major league game was played against the [[Colorado Rockies]] on March 31, [[1998 Arizona Diamondbacks season|1998]], at Bank One Ballpark. The [[Baseball park|ballpark]] was renamed Chase Field in 2005, as a result of [[Bank One Corporation]]'s merger with [[JPMorgan Chase|JPMorgan Chase & Co.]]\n\nSince their debut, the Diamondbacks have won two [[Wild Card Series]], five NL West division titles, two NL pennants, and the [[2001 World Series]].\n\nThey later became the fastest expansion franchise in baseball history to win a World Series. The Diamondbacks defeated the Yankees in Game 7 during the 2001 postseason. \n\nAfter beating the Philadelphia Phillies 4\u20132 in Game 7 of the [[2023 National League Championship Series|2023 NLCS]] at [[Citizens Bank Park]] in Philadelphia, the Arizona Diamondbacks returned to the World Series for the first time since 2001 \u2013 against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] on October 27, 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dotson |first=Kevin |date=October 25, 2023 |title=Arizona Diamondbacks headed to the World Series after beating Phillies for the National League pennant |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/sport/mlb-diamondbacks-phillies-nlcs-spt/index.html |access-date=October 26, 2023 |website=CNN |language=en |archive-date=October 26, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231026193654/https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/sport/mlb-diamondbacks-phillies-nlcs-spt/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\nThey lost the series 4\u20131 at home in Arizona on November 1, 2023.\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n\n===1998\u20132006===\n[[File:Stephen Randolph (35688752701) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Uniform design from late 1990s through mid-2000s]]\nThe Diamondbacks' original colors were purple, black, teal and copper.<ref name=\"purplesedonared\">{{cite press release|title=D-backs shed their skin after unveiling new uniforms, colors on runway|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/ari/y2006/m11/d08/c1737471.jsp|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|date=November 8, 2006|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711034345/http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/ari/y2006/m11/d08/c1737471.jsp|archive-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Their logo was an italicized block letter \"A\" with a diamond pattern, with the crossbar represented by a snake's tongue. This period saw the Diamondbacks wear several uniform combinations.\n\nAt home, the Diamondbacks wore cream uniforms with purple pinstripes. The primary sleeved uniform, worn from 1998 to 2000, featured the full team name (\"Diamond\" and \"Backs\" stacked together) in front and chest numbers. The alternate sleeveless version contained the \"A\" logo on the right chest, and was paired with purple undershirts. Before the 2001 season, the sleeved uniform was changed to feature the \"A\" logo. In all three uniforms, player names were teal with purple trim, and numbers were purple with white with teal trim.\n\nThe Diamondbacks' primary road gray uniform also had purple pinstripes. The first version featured \"Arizona\" in purple with white and teal trim along with black drop shadows, with chest numbers added. Player names were in purple with white trim, and numbers were teal with white and purple trim. In 2001, the uniform became sleeveless with black undershirts, and the lettering scheme was changed to purple with white, copper and black accents.\n\nThe alternate home purple uniform featured \"Arizona\" in teal with white and copper trim and black drop shadows. The letters were rendered in teal with copper and white trim, but were changed to copper with teal and white trim after only one season. This set was worn until 2002.\n\nThe alternate road black uniform featured the \"A\" logo on the right chest, while letters were purple with white trim and numbers were teal with white and purple trim. A zigzag pattern of teal, copper and purple was featured on the sleeves. In 2001, the uniform was changed to feature \"Arizona\" in front. The letters became purple with white and copper trim.\n\nThe Diamondbacks initially wore four different cap versions. The primary home cap is all-purple, while the road cap is black with a teal brim. They also wore a cream cap with purple brim, and a teal cap with purple brim. All designs featured the primary \"A\" logo. In 1999, the road cap became all-black and contained the alternate \"D-snake\" logo rendered in copper. Also, the teal and cream alternate caps were dropped.\n\nThe left sleeve of all four uniforms contained the snake logo with the full team name until the 2004 season, when it became exclusive to the road black uniform.\n\n===2007\u20132015===\nThe franchise unveiled new uniforms and colors of Sedona red, Sonoran sand and black on November 8, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=D-backs unveil new colors, new look|url=http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/1737540/|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|date=November 8, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221160830/http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/1737540/|archive-date=February 21, 2015|access-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[red]] shade is named for the [[sandstone]] [[canyon]] at [[Red Rock State Park]] near [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], while the [[beige]] (sand) shade is named for the [[Sonoran Desert]].<ref name=\"purplesedonared\"/> A sleeve patch was added featuring a lowercase \"d\" and \"b\" configured to look like a snake's head.<ref name=\"purplesedonared\"/> The team also kept the \"D\" logo, which was slightly altered and put on an all-red cap to be used as their game cap. They kept the \"A\" logo with the new colors applied to it, with a solid black cap used as the alternate cap. Arizona's updated color scheme bore a striking resemblance to the [[Houston Astros]]' color scheme (brick red, sand and black) that the Astros used until 2012, as well as the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]], whose adoption of those colors predated the Diamondbacks by four years.\n\nThe white home uniform featured \"D-Backs\" in red with sand and black trim. The road gray uniform featured \"Arizona\" in red with sand and black trim. Player names were red with black trim while numbers were black with red trim.\n\nThe alternate red uniform contained \"D-Backs\" in sand with red and black trim, with player names in sand with black trim and numbers in black with sand trim.\n\nThere were two versions of the alternate black uniform. One design has the alternate \"A\" logo on the right chest, while the other has \"Arizona\" written in red with black and sand trim. The latter was introduced in 2013 as a tribute to the victims of the [[Yarnell Hill Fire]]. On both uniforms, player names were sand with red trim, and numbers in red with sand trim.\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Tony Pe\u00f1a (pitcher)|Tony Pe\u00f1a]] (left) in the 2007\u20132015 home uniform; [[Chris Burke (baseball)|Chris Burke]] (2nd from left) in the 2007\u20132015 road uniform; [[A.

They also unveiled eight different uniform combinations, including two separate home white and away grey uniforms. One major difference between the two sets is that the non-teal uniforms feature a snakeskin pattern on the shoulders, while the teal-trimmed uniforms include a charcoal/grey snakeskin pattern on the back. Arizona also kept the throwback pinstriped sleeveless uniforms from their 2001 championship season for use during Thursday home games.<ref name=\"DbacksUnis2016\">{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=D-backs wow with cutting-edge new uniforms|url=https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/news/arizona-diamondbacks-unveil-new-uniforms/c-158802040|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=Dbacks.com|date=December 3, 2015|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711032508/https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/news/arizona-diamondbacks-unveil-new-uniforms/c-158802040|archive-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2016 Uniforms|url=https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/history/uniforms/2016|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|date=December 3, 2015|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711034347/https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/history/uniforms/2016|archive-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Axisa|first=Mike|title=Look: Diamondbacks unveil seven new uniforms for 2016|url=https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/look-diamondbacks-unveil-seven-new-uniforms-for-2016/|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=December 4, 2015|access-date=September 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909142925/https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/look-diamondbacks-unveil-seven-new-uniforms-for-2016/|archive-date=September 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nStarting with the 2020 season, the Diamondbacks made slight redesigns to their uniforms. The snakeskin patterns were removed while the teal-trimmed grey uniforms were retired. The team also reverted to a standard grey uniform after wearing a darker shade on the previous set. Two home white uniforms remain in use: the primary Sedona Red and the alternate teal. They would also wear two black uniforms: one with the primary \"A\" logo on the left chest and the other with \"Los D-Backs\" trimmed in teal. Three cap designs were also unveiled, all with a black base: the primary \"A\" cap, the teal-trimmed \"snake\" cap (paired exclusively on the teal alternates), and the sand-trimmed \"snake\" cap with red brim (paired exclusively on the Sedona Red alternates). The [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] swoosh logo is also placed on the right chest near the shoulder.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=D-backs unveil 'cleaner' uniforms for 2020|url=https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/news/d-backs-make-changes-to-2020-uniforms|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=DBacks.com|date=November 8, 2019|access-date=July 31, 2023|quote=\"Again, talking about brand, our primary colors are Sedona Red, Sonoran Sand and black,\" Maxey said.|archive-date=April 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405094208/https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/news/d-backs-make-changes-to-2020-uniforms|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2022, the Diamondbacks introduced a red \"A\" cap with black brim.\n\nIn 2021, the Diamondbacks were one of seven teams to wear Nike \"City Connect\" uniforms. The design is primarily sand and has \"Serpientes\" in black script lettering emblazoned in front. The first \"S\" in \"Serpientes\" was shaped to resemble a [[rattlesnake]]. The right sleeve has the [[flag of Arizona]] patch recolored to the Diamondbacks' red, sand and black scheme, and the left sleeve has the \"A\" logo recolored to black and sand. Numerals are in red. The cap is primarily sand with black brim and has the \"A\" logo in black and sand; the regular batting helmet is used with the uniform. Initially, the Diamondbacks wore white pants with this uniform, but has since switched to sand pants.<ref>{{cite web|title=D-Backs City Connect uniforms|url=https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/fans/city-connect|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|access-date=May 19, 2022|archive-date=May 19, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220519051602/https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/fans/city-connect|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBefore the 2023 season, the Diamondbacks promoted the alternate white uniform with teal accents to its primary home uniform and retired the previous Sedona Red white uniform. This is due to a new Nike rule that limits teams to four regular uniforms plus the \"City Connect\" uniform.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=Dbacks |number=1628549742539194368 |date=February 23, 2023 |title=Look good. |access-date=March 29, 2023}}</ref>\n\n===Since 2024===\nComing off their second World Series appearance in {{wsy|2023}}, the Diamondbacks unveiled refreshed uniform designs starting in 2024. Turquoise returned full-time as an accent color on all uniforms along with Sedona red and black, but sand was removed except on the \"City Connect\" uniform. The home uniform is now a cream base with black piping, featuring the \"A\" logo on the left chest. The road grey uniform with black piping featured \"Arizona\" in Sedona red with teal and black outlines. The alternate black uniform with teal piping shared the same features as the home uniform. The alternate Sedona red uniform incorporated the full \"Diamondbacks\" wordmark in black with teal and Sedona red outlines, along with teal numbers trimmed in black on the left chest. All uniforms featured the snake head alternate logo on either sleeve, with the sponsor logo ([[Avnet]] since 2023) on the other sleeve.
