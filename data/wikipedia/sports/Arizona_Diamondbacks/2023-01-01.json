The Diamondbacks compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West]] division. The franchise was established as an [[expansion team]] and began play in [[1998 Major League Baseball expansion|1998]]. The team plays its home games at [[Chase Field]], formerly known as Bank One Ballpark. Along with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], the Diamondbacks are one of the newest teams in MLB.\n\nAfter a fifth-place finish in their inaugural season, the Diamondbacks made several off-season acquisitions, including future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Randy Johnson]], who won four consecutive [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young Awards]] in his first four seasons with the team. In [[1999 Arizona Diamondbacks season|1999]], Arizona won 100 games and their first division championship. In [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2001]], they won the [[2001 World Series|World Series]] over the three-time defending champion New York Yankees, becoming the fastest expansion team in major league history to win the World Series, and the only major professional sports team in the state of Arizona to win a championship. \n\nFrom 1998 to 2022, the Diamondbacks have an overall record of 1,914-2,034 ({{winpct|1,914|2,034}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Arizona Diamondbacks Team History & Encyclopedia |url=https://www.baseballreference.com/teams/ARI/index.shtml |website=Baseball Reference|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main article|History of the Arizona  Diamondbacks}}\n{{See also|1998 Major League Baseball expansion}}\n\nOn March 9, 1995, Phoenix was awarded an expansion franchise to begin play for the {{mlby|1998}} season. A $130 million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball and on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were officially voted into the National League.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baseball Expansion Teams Put in Leagues|date=January 17, 1997|newspaper=Southeastern Missourian}}</ref> The Diamondbacks' first major league game was played against the [[Colorado Rockies]] on March 31, [[1998 Arizona Diamondbacks season|1998]], at Bank One Ballpark. The [[Baseball park|ballpark]] was renamed Chase Field in 2005, as a result of [[Bank One Corporation]]'s merger with [[JPMorgan Chase|JPMorgan Chase & Co.]]\n\nSince their debut, the Diamondbacks have won five NL West division titles, one NL pennant, one Wild Card game, and the [[2001 World Series]].\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n\n===1998\u20132006===\n[[File:Stephen Randolph (35688752701) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Uniform design from late 1990s through mid-2000s]]\nThe Diamondbacks' original colors were purple, black, teal and copper.<ref name=\"purplesedonared\">{{cite press release|title=D-backs shed their skin after unveiling new uniforms, colors on runway|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/ari/y2006/m11/d08/c1737471.jsp|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|date=November 8, 2006|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711034345/http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/ari/y2006/m11/d08/c1737471.jsp|archive-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Their first logo was an italicized block letter \"A\" with a diamond pattern, and the crossbar represented by a snake's tongue. This period saw the Diamondbacks wear various uniform combinations.\n\nAt home, the Diamondbacks wore cream uniforms with purple pinstripes. The primary sleeved uniform, worn from 1998 to 2000, featured the full team name (\"Diamond\" and \"Backs\" stacked together) in front and chest numbers. The alternate sleeveless version contained the \"A\" logo on the right chest, and was paired with purple undershirts. Before the 2001 season, the sleeved uniform was changed to feature the \"A\" logo. In all three uniforms, player names were teal with purple trim, and  numbers were purple with white with teal trim.\n\nThe Diamondbacks' primary road gray uniform also contained purple pinstripes. The first version featured \"Arizona\" in purple with white and teal trim along with black drop shadows. Chest numbers were also added. Player names were in purple with white trim, and numbers were teal with white and purple trim. In 2001, the uniform became sleeveless with black undershirts, and the lettering scheme was changed to purple with white, copper and black accents.\n\nThe alternate home purple uniform featured \"Arizona\" in teal with white and copper trim and black drop shadows. Originally the letters were rendered in teal with copper and white trim, but was changed to copper with teal and white trim after only one season. This set was worn until 2002.\n\nThe alternate road black uniform initially featured the \"A\" logo on the right chest, while letters were in purple with white trim and numbers in teal with white and purple trim. A zigzag pattern of teal, copper and purple was also featured on the sleeves. In 2001, the uniform was changed to feature \"Arizona\" in front. Letters were now purple with white and copper trim.\n\nThe Diamondbacks initially wore four different cap versions. The primary home cap is all-purple, while the road cap is black with a teal brim. They also wore a cream cap with purple brim, and a teal cap with purple brim. All designs featured the primary \"A\" logo. In 1999, the road cap became all-black and contained the alternate \"D-snake\" logo rendered in copper. Also, the teal and cream alternate caps were dropped.\n\nThe left sleeve of all four uniforms initially contained the snake logo with the full team name, but became only exclusive to the road black uniform after the 2003 season.\n\n===2006\u20132015===\nThe franchise unveiled new uniforms and colors of Sedona red, Sonoran sand and black on November 8, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=D-backs unveil new colors, new look|url=http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/1737540/|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|date=November 8, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221160830/http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/1737540/|archive-date=February 21, 2015|access-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[red]] shade is named for the [[sandstone]] [[canyon]] at [[Red Rock State Park]] near [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], while the [[beige]] (sand) shade is named for the [[Sonoran Desert]].<ref name=\"purplesedonared\"/> A sleeve patch was added featuring a lowercase \"d\" and \"b\" configured to look like a snake's head.<ref name=\"purplesedonared\"/> The team also kept the \"D\" logo, which was slightly altered and put on an all-red cap to be used as their game cap. They also kept the \"A\" logo with the new colors applied to it, with a solid black cap used as the alternate cap. Arizona's updated color scheme bore a striking resemblance to the [[Houston Astros]]' then-current color scheme (brick red, sand and black) that the latter used until 2012, as well as the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]], whose adoption of said colors predate the Diamondbacks by four years.\n\nThe white home uniform featured \"D-Backs\" in red with sand and black trim. The road gray uniform featured \"Arizona\" in red with sand and black trim. Player names were red with black trim while numbers were black with red trim.\n\nThe alternate red uniform  contained \"D-Backs\" in sand with red and black trim, with player names in sand with black trim and numbers in black with sand trim.\n\nThere were two versions of the alternate black uniform. One design has the alternate \"A\" logo on the right chest, while the other has \"Arizona\" written in red with black and sand trim. The latter was introduced in 2013 as a tribute to the victims of the [[Yarnell Hill Fire]]. On both uniforms, player names were sand with red trim, and numbers in red with sand trim.\n\n===2016\u2013present===\n[[File:Archie Bradley (48052890923) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Current uniform design (2016\u2013present)]]\nPrior to the 2016 season, the  Diamondbacks reincorporated teal into its color scheme while keeping Sedona Red, Sonoran Sand and black. They also unveiled eight different uniform combinations, including two separate home white and away grey uniforms. One major difference between the two sets is that the non-teal uniforms feature a snakeskin pattern on the shoulders, while the teal-trimmed uniforms include a charcoal/grey snakeskin pattern on the back. Arizona also kept the throwback pinstriped sleeveless uniforms from their 2001 championship season for use during Thursday home games.<ref name=\"DbacksUnis2016\">{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=D-backs wow with cutting-edge new uniforms|url=https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/news/arizona-diamondbacks-unveil-new-uniforms/c-158802040|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=Dbacks.com|date=December 3, 2015|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711032508/https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/news/arizona-diamondbacks-unveil-new-uniforms/c-158802040|archive-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2016 Uniforms|url=https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/history/uniforms/2016|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|date=December 3, 2015|access-date=July 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711034347/https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/history/uniforms/2016|archive-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Axisa|first=Mike|title=Look: Diamondbacks unveil seven new uniforms for 2016|url=https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/look-diamondbacks-unveil-seven-new-uniforms-for-2016/|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=December 4, 2015|access-date=September 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909142925/https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/look-diamondbacks-unveil-seven-new-uniforms-for-2016/|archive-date=September 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nStarting with the 2020 season, the Diamondbacks made slight redesigns to their current uniforms. The snakeskin patterns were removed while the teal-trimmed grey uniforms were retired. The team also reverted to a standard grey uniform after wearing a darker shade on the previous set. Two home white uniforms remain in use: the primary Sedona Red and the alternate teal. They would also wear two black uniforms: one with the primary \"A\" logo on the left chest and the other with \"Los D-Backs\" trimmed in teal. Three cap designs were also unveiled, all with a black base: the primary \"A\" cap, the teal-trimmed \"snake\" cap (paired exclusively on the teal alternates), and the sand-trimmed \"snake\" cap with red brim (paired exclusively on the Sedona Red alternates). The [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] swoosh logo is also placed on the right chest near the shoulder.<ref name=\"GilbertDbacks\" /> In 2022, the Diamondbacks introduced a red \"A\" cap with black brim.\n\nIn 2021, the Diamondbacks were one of seven teams to wear Nike \"City Connect\" uniforms. The design is primarily sand and has \"Serpientes\" in black script lettering emblazoned in front. The first \"S\" in \"Serpientes\" was shaped to resemble a [[rattlesnake]]. The right sleeve has the [[flag of Arizona]] patch recolored to the Diamondbacks' current red, sand and black scheme, and the left sleeve has the \"A\" logo recolored to black and sand. Numerals are in red. The cap is primarily sand with black brim and has the \"A\" logo in black and sand; the regular batting helmet is used with the uniform. Initially, the Diamondbacks wore white pants with this uniform, but has since switched to sand pants.<ref>{{cite web|title=D-Backs City Connect uniforms|url=https://www.mlb.com/dbacks/fans/city-connect|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Dbacks.com|access-date=May 19, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Regular season home attendance==\n[[File:Chase Field, July 3, 2021.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Chase Field]]]]\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"width:300px; font-size:90%; border:2px solid #C41E3A;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; font-size:larger;\"\n| colspan=5 style=\"{{Baseball primary style|Arizona Diamondbacks}};\"|'''Home Attendance'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ARI/attend.shtml |title=Arizona Diamondbacks Attendance, Stadiums, and Park Factors |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref>\n|- style={{Baseball secondary style|Arizona Diamondbacks}};\"\n| '''Year''' || '''Total attendance''' || '''Game average''' || '''League rank'''\n|-\n| [[1998 Arizona Diamondbacks season|1998]]\n| 3,610,290\n| 44,571\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[1999 Arizona Diamondbacks season|1999]]\n| 3,019,654\n| 37,280\n| 5th\n|-\n| [[2000 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2000]]\n| 2,942,251\n| 36,324\n| 6th\n|-\n| [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2001]]\n| 2,736,451\n| 33,783\n| 9th\n|-\n| [[2002 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2002]]\n| 3,198,977\n| 39,494\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2003 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2003]]\n| 2,805,542\n| 34,636\n| 5th\n|-\n| [[2004 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2004]]\n| 2,519,560\n| 31,106\n| 8th\n|-\n| [[2005 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2005]]\n| 2,059,424\n| 25,425\n| 12th\n|-\n| [[2006 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2006]]\n| 2,091,685\n| 25,823\n| 14th\n|-\n| [[2007 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2007]]\n| 2,325,249\n| 28,707\n| 12th\n|-\n| [[2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2008]]\n| 2,509,924\n| 30,987\n| 11th\n|-\n| [[2009 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2009]]\n| 2,128,765\n| 26,281\n| 11th\n|-\n| [[2010 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2010]]\n| 2,056,697\n| 25,391\n| 13th\n|-\n| [[2011 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2011]]\n| 2,105,432\n| 25,993 \n| 12th\n|-\n| [[2012 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2012]]\n| 2,177,617\n| 26,884\n| 13th\n|-\n| [[2013 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2013]]\n| 2,134,895\n| 26,357\n| 14th\n|-\n| [[2014 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2014]]\n| 2,073,730\n| 25,602\n| 14th\n|-\n| [[2015 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2015]]\n| 2,080,145\n| 25,681\n| 12th\n|-\n| [[2016 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2016]]\n| 2,036,216\n| 25,138\n| 11th\n|-\n| [[2017 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2017]]\n| 2,134,375\n| 26,350\n| 11th\n|-\n| [[2018 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2018]]\n| 2,242,695\n| 27,688\n| 9th\n|-\n| [[2019 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2019]]\n| 2,135,510\n| 26,364\n| 12th\n|-\n| [[2020 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2020]]\n| 0\n| 0\n| N/A\n|-\n| [[2021 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2021]]\n| 1,043,010\n| 12,877\n| 13th\n|-\n| [[2022 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2022]]\n| 1,605,199\n| 19,817\n| 12th\n|}\n\n==Radio and television==\nThe primary television play-by-play voice for the team's first nine seasons of play was [[Thom Brennaman]], who also broadcast baseball and [[college football]] games nationally for [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox Television]].
