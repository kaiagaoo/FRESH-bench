The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract, are required to be in a six-month testing pool prior to competition. (3) No doping violation is handed down to newly signed UFC fighters who voluntarily disclose the use of a prohibited substance prior to testing. (4) \"In-competition\" testing begins at noon on the weigh-in day and ends one hour after a fighter clears a post-fight medical for non-selected post-fight testing. For fighters who are subjected to post-fight testing the in-competition testing ends after any post-fight testing is done.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmaimports.com/2017/03/usada-drug-testing-policies-loosen-up-for-ufc-fighters-heres-the-update/| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211018/http://mmaimports.com/2017/03/usada-drug-testing-policies-loosen-up-for-ufc-fighters-heres-the-update/| archive-date=2021-10-18|title=USADA Drug Testing Policies Loosen Up For UFC Fighters, Here's The Update|date=March 29, 2017|website=MMA Imports|language=en-US|access-date=May 17, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/11/16740288/ufc-usada-loophole-secret-exemptions-from-drug-testing-peds-steroids| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211018/https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/11/16740288/ufc-usada-loophole-secret-exemptions-from-drug-testing-peds-steroids| archive-date=2021-10-18|title=UFC-USADA loophole could be letting chosen athletes avoid testing in secret|last=Kidd|first=Iain|date=December 11, 2017|website=Bloody Elbow|access-date=May 17, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-and-usada-make-significant-changes-to-anti-doping-policy| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211018/https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-and-usada-make-significant-changes-to-anti-doping-policy| archive-date=2021-10-18|title=UFC and USADA make significant changes to anti-doping policy|date=February 17, 2017|website=FoxSports|language=en-US|access-date=May 17, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, it was indicated no announcements would be made on fighters who have been flagged for a potential doping violation until the entire adjudication processes are conducted with the results of the potential doping violation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lowkickmma.com/ufc-makes-major-changes-to-usada-drug-testing-policy/| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211018/https://www.lowkickmma.com/ufc-makes-major-changes-to-usada-drug-testing-policy/| archive-date=2021-10-18|title=UFC Makes Major Changes To USADA Drug-Testing Policy|last1=Drahota|first1=Mike|last2=MMA|first2=LowKick|date=September 29, 2018|website=LowKickMMA.com|language=en-US|access-date=May 17, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmanytt.com/ufc/ufc-and-usada-make-major-change-to-anti-doping-policy-going-forward/| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211018/https://www.mmanytt.com/ufc/ufc-and-usada-make-major-change-to-anti-doping-policy-going-forward/| archive-date=2021-10-18|title=UFC and USADA Make Major Change to Anti-Doping Policy Going Forward|date=September 29, 2018|website=MMAnytt.com|language=en-US|access-date=May 17, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref> This came after several cases of fighters, such as [[Anderson Silva]], Junior dos Santos, [[Josh Barnett]] and [[Cris Cyborg]], being flagged for potential doping violations, but cleared after they were proved of unintentional use of [[performance enhancing drug]]s (usually in the form of contaminated supplements).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/9/29/17918010/ufc-changes-policy-on-when-it-announces-failed-drug-tests| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211018/https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/9/29/17918010/ufc-changes-policy-on-when-it-announces-failed-drug-tests| archive-date=2021-10-18|title=UFC changes policy on when it announces failed drug tests|work=MMA Fighting|access-date=September 29, 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> On November 25, 2019, news surfaced that the UFC and USADA had revised their policies, providing a list of certified supplements that will not lead to sanctions should contaminated samples occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-usada-anti-doping-policy-changes-announced| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211018/https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-usada-anti-doping-policy-changes-announced| archive-date=2021-10-18|title=UFC, USADA address contaminated supplements issue with 'significant changes' to anti-doping policy|author=Simon Head|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=November 25, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In January 2021, USADA announced that marijuana would no longer be included in the list of banned substances and they would not penalize any fighter for testing positive for it either before, during, or after a fight.

In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC 263]] marked the first time in UFC history that a non-title bout other than the main-event was scheduled for 5 rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\n==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===\n\n[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] [[Upset (competition)|upsets]] [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\".

Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211018/http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay| archive-date=2021-10-18|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|access-date=December 3, 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the idea of the ranking and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1\u20135 fights, 6\u201310 fights, 11\u201315 fights, and 16\u201320 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211018/http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay| archive-date=2021-10-18|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|access-date=April 20, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015.

Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters.

Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers a serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend themselves)\n**doctor stoppage (a ringside doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman/cornerwoman signals defeat for their own fighter)\n**forfeit (a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no-contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\n===Judging criteria===\n\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\n===Fouls===\n\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to the excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200 lb) and lightweight (200 lb and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of neck and head, and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five-minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard.

Lightweight becomes known as [[Welterweight (MMA)|welterweight]], middleweight becomes [[Light Heavyweight (MMA)|light heavyweight]], and a new [[Middleweight (MMA)|middleweight]] class is introduced at 185 pounds.

In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds.
