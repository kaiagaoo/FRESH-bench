This persistent lack of success led to poor relations between the fanbase and the chairman, the managers, and even some individual players.\n\nMoratti later became a target of the fans, especially when he sacked the much-loved coach [[Luigi Simoni]] after a few games into the 1998\u201399 season, five days after Inter have defeated Real Madrid 3\u20131 at San Siro in Champions League group stage with two goals from [[Roberto Baggio]], and having just received the Italian manager of the year award for 1998 the day before being dismissed.\nThat season despite 4 coaches changes Inter reached Champions League quarter Finals when it will be eliminated from Manchester United that would go on to win the trophy that year; Inter failed to qualify for any European competition for the first time in seven years, finishing in eighth place.\n\n[[File:Jerseys of Ronaldo, Zanetti, Zamorano & Figo.jpg|thumb|Jerseys of [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] (number 10), [[Iv\u00e1n Zamorano|Zamorano]] (one plus eight) and [[Lu\u00eds Figo|Figo]] (seven) in the San Siro museum]]\n\nIn the previous seasons in 1996-1997 Inter reached for third time Uefa Cup final losing this time at penalty in Giuseppe Meazza against [[Schalke 04]] with [[Roy Hodgson]] that resigned shortly afterwards, instead in 1997-1998 under Simoni Inter had won his third [[UEFA Cup]] defending in Paris final Lazio 3\u20130 with goals from [[Ivan Zamorano]], Zanetti and Ronaldo, and nearly won Serie A title, with many controversial referee decisions culminated in the decisive match against Juventus in Turin with Inter behind only 1 point with 4 games left, when referee didn't concede a penalty on [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and after few seconds conceded a penalty for Juventus, that generated a turmoil on the pitch and a big scandal, with president Moratti that left the building shortly afterwards.\n\n[[File:San Siro Museum, Milan( Ank Kumar, Infosys) 02.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|[[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]'s first season with Inter ended with 34 goals scored in 47 matches.]]\n\nThe following season, 1999\u20132000, Moratti appointed former Juventus manager [[Marcello Lippi]], and signed players such as [[Angelo Peruzzi]], [[Laurent Blanc]] and [[Clarence Seedorf]] from Real Madrid, together with other former Juventus players Vieri and [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]] and sold important players like [[Diego Simeone]], [[Youri Djorkaeff]] and [[Gianluca Pagliuca]]. The team came close to their first domestic success since 1989 when they reached the [[Coppa Italia]] final, only to be defeated by Lazio, in a match remembered for the second severe injury to the right knee of Ronaldo, who was returning after five months of inactivity, and which would keep him out for more than a year and a half.\n\nInter's misfortunes continued the following season, losing the [[2000 Supercoppa Italiana]] match against Lazio 4\u20133, after initially taking the lead through new signing [[Robbie Keane]]. They were also eliminated in the preliminary round of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] by Swedish club [[Helsingborgs IF|Helsingborgs]], with [[\u00c1lvaro Recoba]] missing a crucial late penalty. Lippi was sacked after only a single game of the new season following Inter's first ever Serie A defeat to [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]]. [[Marco Tardelli]], chosen to replace Lippi, failed to improve results, and is remembered by Inter fans as the manager who lost 6\u20130 in the city derby against Milan.\n\nIn 2002 with new coach [[Hector Cuper]], the acquisition of the second most expensive goalkeeper in the world at that time [[Francesco Toldo]] and the return after injury of Ronaldo in pair with Vieri, not only did Inter manage to make it to the UEFA Cup semi-finals, but were also only 45 minutes away from capturing the ''Scudetto'' when they needed to maintain their one-goal advantage away to Lazio. Inter were 2\u20131 up after only 24 minutes. Lazio equalised during first half injury time, and then scored two more goals by Simeone and [[Simone Inzaghi]] in the second half to secure victory that saw Juventus win the championship, Roma ended second and Inter third. After brilliant performances and have won 2002 World Cup with Brazil, Ronaldo demanded and ottened to be sold to [[Real Madrid]] for \u20ac45 million, and was replaced by [[Hernan Crespo]] from Lazio for \u20ac40 million, Seedorf was sold to AC Milan and [[Fabio Cannavaro]] was acquired from Parma.\n\nThe next season Inter finished as league runners-up with Vieri that was top scorer of [[2002\u201303 Serie A|Serie A]] with 24 goals in 23 matches, while Crespo set a new record for [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League first group stage|UCL Group stage]] with 8 goals in 6 matches but missed almost the rest of the season for a severe injury in January.

Politically, one group (Irriducibili) of Inter Ultras are right-wing and this group has relations with the Lazio ultras.
