Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1965 European Cup Final|final]] held at home, from a Jair goal, and then again beat Independiente in the Intercontinental Cup, becoming the first European team to win two times in a row the competition.

During the 1970s and the 1980s, Inter also added two to its Coppa Italia tally, in 1977\u201378 and 1981\u201382.\n\n[[Hansi M\u00fcller]] (1975\u20131982 VfB Stuttgart, 1982\u20131984 Inter Milan) and [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] (1974\u20131984 Bayern Munich, 1984\u20131987 Inter Milan) played for Inter Milan. Led by the German duo of [[Andreas Brehme]] and [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]], and Argentine [[Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz]], Inter captured the 1989 Serie A championship. Inter were unable to defend their title, despite adding fellow German [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] to the squad and winning their first [[1989 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa Italiana]] at the start of the season.\n\n===Mixed fortunes (1991\u20132004)===\nThe 1990s was a lackluster period. While their great rivals Milan and [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] were achieving success both domestically and in Europe, Inter enjoyed little success in the domestic league standings, their worst coming in [[1993\u201394 Serie A|1993\u201394]] when they finished just one point out of the relegation zone. Nevertheless, they achieved some European success, with three [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] victories, in 1991, 1994 and 1998.\n\nWith [[Massimo Moratti]]'s takeover from [[Ernesto Pellegrini]] in 1995, Inter twice broke the [[World football transfer record|world record transfer fee]] in this period ([[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]19.5&nbsp;million for [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] from Barcelona in 1997 and \u00a331&nbsp;million for [[Christian Vieri]] from [[SS Lazio|Lazio]] two years later).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smyth|first1=Rob|title=Ronaldo at 40: Il Fenomeno's legacy as greatest ever No 9, despite dodgy knees|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/17/ronaldo-40-birthday-brazil-greatest-ever-striker|work=The Guardian|date=17 September 2016|access-date=7 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907161434/https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/17/ronaldo-40-birthday-brazil-greatest-ever-striker|archive-date=7 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the 1990s remained the only decade in Inter's history, alongside the 1940s, in which they did not win a single Serie A championship. This persistent lack of success led to  poor relations between the fanbase and the chairman, the managers, and even some individual players.\n[[File:Jerseys of Ronaldo, Zanetti, Zamorano & Figo.jpg|thumb|Jerseys of [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] (number 10), [[Iv\u00e1n Zamorano|Zamorano]] (one plus eight) and [[Lu\u00eds Figo|Figo]] (seven) in the San Siro museum]]\n\nMoratti later became a target of the fans, especially when he sacked the much-loved coach [[Luigi Simoni]] after a few games into the 1998\u201399 season, having just received the Italian manager of the year award for 1998 the day before being dismissed. That season, Inter failed to qualify for any European competition for the first time in almost ten years, finishing in eighth place.\n\nThe following season, Moratti appointed former Juventus manager [[Marcello Lippi]], and signed players such as [[Angelo Peruzzi]] and [[Laurent Blanc]], together with other former Juventus players Vieri and [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]]. The team came close to their first domestic success since 1989 when they reached the [[Coppa Italia]] final, only to be defeated by Lazio.\n\nInter's misfortunes continued the following season, losing the [[2000 Supercoppa Italiana]] match against Lazio 4\u20133, after initially taking the lead through new signing [[Robbie Keane]]. They were also eliminated in the preliminary round of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] by Swedish club [[Helsingborgs IF|Helsingborgs]], with [[\u00c1lvaro Recoba]] missing a crucial late penalty. Lippi was sacked after only a single game of the new season following Inter's first ever Serie A defeat to [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]]. [[Marco Tardelli]], chosen to replace Lippi, failed to improve results, and is remembered by Inter fans as the manager who lost 6\u20130 in the city derby against Milan. Other members of the Inter \"family\" during this period who suffered were the likes of Vieri and [[Fabio Cannavaro]], both of whom had their restaurants in Milan vandalised after defeats to the ''Rossoneri''.\n\nIn 2002, not only did Inter manage to make it to the UEFA Cup semi-finals, but were also only 45 minutes away from capturing the ''Scudetto'' when they needed to maintain their one-goal advantage away to Lazio. Inter were 2\u20131 up after only 24 minutes. Lazio equalised during first half injury time, and then scored two more goals in the second half to secure victory that saw Juventus win the championship. The next season, Inter finished as league runners-up and also reached the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League#Semi-finals|2002\u201303 Champions League]] semi-finals against Milan, losing on the [[away goals rule]].\n\n===Comeback and unprecedented treble (2004\u20132011)===\n[[File:Consegna Coppa Italia.

The more commonly used name, ''San Siro'', is the name of [[San Siro (district)|the district where it is located]]. San Siro has been the home of Milan since 1926, when it was privately built by funding from Milan's chairman at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took {{frac|13|1|2}} months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Inter, when they were accepted as joint tenant.\n\nThe first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Inter beat Milan 6\u20133 in a friendly match. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1\u20132 to [[Sampierdarenese]]. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations. A major structural renovation was made for the [[2016 UEFA Champions League Final]] while another one took place in late 2021 to host the [[UEFA Nations League]] final.

At the same time during [[Silvio Berlusconi]] reign, Milan fans were viewed as belonging to the centre-right.\n\nThe traditional [[ultras]] group of Inter is ''Boys San''; which are one of the oldest Italian ultras groups, being founded in 1969. Politically, one group (Irriducibili) of Inter Ultras are right-wing and this group has relations with the Lazio ultras. As well as the main group (apolitical) of ''Boys San'', there are five more significant groups: ''Viking'' (apolitical), ''Irriducibili'' (right-wing), ''Ultras'' (apolitical), ''Brianza Alcoolica'' (apolitical) and ''Imbastisci'' (left-wing).\n\nInter's most vocal fans gather in the Curva Nord, or north curve of the San Siro. This longstanding tradition has led to the Curva Nord being synonymous with the club's most die-hard supporters, who unfurl banners and wave flags in support of their team.\n[[File:Inter vs Milan - 1915 - Coppa Gazzetta dello Sport.jpg|thumb|300px|Scene of a Derby della Madonnina in 1915]]\n\nInter have several rivalries, two of which are highly significant in [[Italian football]]; firstly, they participate in the intracity ''[[Derby della Madonnina]]'' with [[AC Milan|Milan]]; the rivalry has existed ever since Inter splintered off from Milan in 1908.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The name of the derby refers to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] atop the [[Milan Cathedral]]. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the match. [[Flare]]s are commonly present, but they also led to the abandonment of the second leg of the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League|2004\u201305 Champions League]] quarter-final matchup between Milan and Inter on 12 April, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan keeper [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]] on the shoulder.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4432047.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Milan game ended by crowd trouble|date=25 July 2007|access-date=23 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205192237/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4432047.stm|archive-date=5 February 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe other principal rivalry is with Juventus; matches between the two clubs are known as the ''[[Derby d'Italia]]''. Up until the [[2006 Italian football scandal]], which saw Juventus relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs never to have played below Serie A. In the 2000s, Inter developed a rivalry with [[AS Roma|Roma]], who finished as runners-up to Inter in all but one of Inter's five ''Scudetto''-winning seasons between 2005\u201306 and 2009\u201310.
