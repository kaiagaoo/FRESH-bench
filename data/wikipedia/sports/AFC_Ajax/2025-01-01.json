Ajax later also played in the [[Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam)|Olympic Stadium]] built for the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] hosted in [[Amsterdam]]. This stadium, designed by [[Jan Wils]], is known in Dutch as {{Lang|nl|het Olympisch Stadion}}. In 1934, Ajax moved to [[De Meer Stadion]] in east Amsterdam, close to the location of Het Houten Stadion. It was designed by architect and Ajax-member [[Jordanus Roodenburgh|Daan Roodenburgh]], who had also designed the club's first stadium. It could accommodate 29,500 spectators and Ajax continued to play there until 1996. For big European and national fixtures, the club would often play at the Olympic Stadium, which could accommodate about twice the number of spectators.\n\nIn 1996, Ajax moved to a new home ground in the southeast of the city known as the Amsterdam Arena, since 2018 known as the [[Johan Cruyff Arena]]. This stadium was built by the Amsterdam city authority at a cost of $134 million. The stadium is capable of holding 55,865 spectators. The Arena has a retractable roof and set a trend for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the Arena earned a reputation for a terrible grass pitch caused by the removable roof that, even when open, takes away too much sunlight and fresh air. During the 2008\u201309 season, ground staff introduced an artificial lighting system that finally reduced this problem considerably.\n\nThe much-loved De Meer Stadion was torn down and the land was sold to the city council. A residential neighbourhood now occupies the area. The only thing left of the old stadium are the letters \"AJAX\", which nowadays is in place on the fa\u00e7ade of the entrance at the Johan Cruyff Arena and a replica of the letters are at [[Sportpark De Toekomst|De Toekomst]], near the Johan Cruyff Arena.\n\n==Crest and colours==\n\n===Crest===\nIn 1900, when the club was founded, the emblem of Ajax was just a picture of an Ajax player. The crest was slightly altered following the club's promotion to the top division in 1911 to match the club's new outfits. In 1928, the club logo was introduced with the head of the [[Greeks|Greek]] hero [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]]. The logo was once again changed in 1990 into an abstract version of the previous one.

Under manager [[Jack Kirwan]], however, the club earned promotion to the top flight of Dutch football for the first time in 1911 (then the ''Eerste Klasse'' or 'First Class', later named the {{Lang|nl|Eredivisie|italic=no}}), Ajax was forced to change its colours because [[Sparta Rotterdam]] already had exactly the same outfit. Special kits for away fixtures did not exist at the time and according to football association regulations the newcomers had to change their colours if two teams in the same league had identical uniforms.

won in 1972, however UEFA only sanctioned the UEFA Super Cup for the first time in 1973 so the 1972 edition was an unofficial one. Played against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], winners of the 1971\u201372 European Cup Winners' Cup, it went ahead as 'a celebration of the Centenary of Rangers F.C.' (see below) because [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] was serving a one-year ban at the time, imposed by UEFA for the misbehaviour of its fans. That victory meant Ajax had won every tournament (5 in total) they entered that year, a feat [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] achieved in 1967 (with 6 trophies), [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 2009 (6 trophies), and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern]] in 2020 (also 6 trophies).\n\n===Other trophies===\nAjax have won numerous [[Exhibition game|friendly]] tournaments, unsanctioned by UEFA or FIFA, including the [[Amsterdam Tournament]], [[Bruges Matins (football)|Bruges Matins Trophy]], [[Trofeo Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]], [[Eus\u00e9bio Cup]], [[Ted Bates (footballer)#Ted Bates Trophy|Ted Bates Trophy]], Jalkapalloturnaus and [[Chippie Polar Cup]] (''for a complete list, see: [[list of AFC Ajax honours]]'').\n\n===Club Awards===\n*'''[[World Soccer (magazine)|''World Soccer'' World Team of the Year]]''' : '''1'''\n:: 1995\n*'''[[France Football European Team of the Year|''France Football'' European Team of the Year]]''' : '''4'''\n:: 1969, 1971, 1972, 1973\n*'''Dutch Sports Team of the Year''' : '''5'''\n:: 1968, 1969, 1972, 1987, 1995<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nocnsf.nl/nocnsf.nl/olympische-droom/verkiezingen/sportploeg-van-het-jaar |title=Sportploeg van het Jaar |publisher=NOCNSF.nl |access-date=3 August 2013 |archive-date=21 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521204255/http://www.nocnsf.nl/nocnsf.nl/olympische-droom/verkiezingen/sportploeg-van-het-jaar |url-status=live }}</ref>\n*'''Sports Team of the Year''' : '''1'''\n:: 1990\n*'''[[International Federation of Football History & Statistics#The World's Best Club|IFFHS The World's Club Team of the Year]]''' : '''1'''\n:: 1992\n*'''Dick van Rijn Trophy''' : '''1'''\n:: 1995\n*'''[[Amsterdam Sportsman of the year|Amsterdam Sportsteam of the year]]''': '''3'''\n:: 2011, 2013, 2014<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.rtvnh.nl/sport/129705/Ellen+van+Dijk+sportvrouw+Amsterdam,+Ajax+sportploeg | title = Ellen van Dijk sportvrouw Amsterdam, Ajax sportploeg | publisher = rtvnh.nl | date = 17 December 2013 | access-date = 17 December 2013 | language = nl | archive-date = 17 December 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224602/http://www.rtvnh.nl/sport/129705/Ellen+van+Dijk+sportvrouw+Amsterdam,+Ajax+sportploeg | url-status = live }}</ref>\n*'''ING Fair Play Award''' : '''2'''\n:: 2013, 2014<ref>[http://knvb.nl/nieuws/29413/ajax-wint-ing-fair-play-prijs ''Ajax wint ING Fair Play-prijs''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506070441/http://knvb.nl/nieuws/29413/ajax-wint-ing-fair-play-prijs |date=6 May 2014 }}, website knvb.nl (14 May 2013)</ref><ref>[https://archive.today/20140505183151/http://www.knvb.nl/nieuws/34805/ajax-winnaar-ing fair-play-prijs ''Ajax winnaar ING Fair Play-prijs''], website knvb.nl (5 May 2014)</ref>\n*'''Fair Play Cup''' : '''1'''\n:: 1995\n*'''[[FIFA Club of the Century]]''' : shared 5th place\n:: 20th Century\n*'''[[kicker (sports magazine)#Kicker Sportmagazin Club of the Century|''kicker Sportmagazin'' Club of the Century]]''': 2nd place\n:: 20th Century\n*'''Best Dutch club after 50 years of professional football''' : '''1'''\n:: 2004<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ajax.nl/Ajax-Nieuws/Ajax-nieuwsarchief/Ajax-nieuwsartikel/Ajax-beste-club-betaald-voetbal.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130805053927/http://www.ajax.nl/Ajax-Nieuws/Ajax-nieuwsarchief/Ajax-nieuwsartikel/Ajax-beste-club-betaald-voetbal.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 August 2013 |title=Ajax beste club betaald voetbal |publisher=Ajax.nl |access-date=3 August 2013 }}</ref>\n*'''Football shirt of the Year''' : '''Ajax away shirt by adidas'''\n:: [[2013\u201314 AFC Ajax season|2013\u201314]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voetbalshirtvanhetjaar.com/|title=Football shirt of the year|publisher=Subside Sports|access-date=17 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411194721/http://www.voetbalshirtvanhetjaar.com/|archive-date=11 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*'''The Four-Four-Two Greatest Club Side Ever''' : '''Ajax (1965\u20131973)'''\n:: 2013<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inthestands.co.uk/featured/the-four-four-two-greatest-club-side-ever-list.html|title=The Four-Four-Two Greatest Club Side Ever List|publisher=In The Stands|access-date=15 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205212935/http://www.inthestands.co.uk/featured/the-four-four-two-greatest-club-side-ever-list.html|archive-date=5 February 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*'''VVCS Best Pitch of the Year''' : '''1'''\n:: 2012\n\n==Honorary club members==\nAjax have a total of 50 honorary club members, from people who have been invested within the club's administrative engagements, to committed players who have excelled in the athletic department.
