Originally, Hunt chose [[Columbia blue]] and [[Orange (colour)|orange]] for the Texans' uniforms, but [[Bud Adams]] chose Columbia blue and scarlet for his [[Houston Oilers]] franchise.<ref name=\"Uniform History\" /> Hunt reverted to red and gold for the Texans' uniforms, which even after the team relocated to Kansas City, remain as the franchise's colors to this day.<ref name=\"Uniform History\" />\n\nThe state of Texas on the team's helmet was replaced by an [[arrowhead]] design originally sketched by Lamar Hunt on a napkin.<ref name=\"Uniform History\" /> Hunt's inspiration for the interlocking \"KC\" design was the \"SF\" inside of an oval on the [[San Francisco 49ers]] helmets.<ref name=\"Uniform History\" /> Unlike the 49ers' logo, Kansas City's overlapping initials appear inside a white arrowhead instead of an oval and are surrounded by a thin black outline.<ref name=\"Uniform History\" /> From 1960 to 1973, the Chiefs had grey facemask bars on their helmets, but changed to white facemasks in 1974, making them one of the first teams (alongside the San Diego Chargers, who introduced a yellow facemask that same year) in the NFL to use a non-gray facemask.<ref name=\"Uniform History\" />\n\nThe Chiefs' uniform design has essentially remained the same throughout the club's history with only four minor changes occurring.<ref name=\"Uniform History\" /> It consists of a red helmet, and either red or white jerseys with the opposite color numbers and names.<ref name=\"Uniform History\" /> White pants were used with both jerseys from 1960 to 1967, and 1989 to 1999.<ref name=\"Uniform History\" /> Beginning in 2009, during the Pioli/Haley era, the team has alternated between white and red pants for road games during the season. Prior to September 15, 2013, the Chiefs always wore white pants with their red jerseys. The Chiefs do not have an official alternate jersey, although unofficial alternate jerseys are sold for retail.\n\nThe Chiefs wore their white jerseys with white pants at home for the 2006 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. The logic behind the uniform selection that day was that the Bengals would have to wear their black uniform on a day when hot temperatures were forecast.<ref>Ferrin, Reid.
