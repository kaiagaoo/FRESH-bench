The priest, Father Dewald was blocked at the door when he tried to break up the organising meeting being held in a room of the local pub, ''Zum Wildsch\u00fctz''. The founders were Franz and Paul Braun, Henry Cleve, Hans Debest, Paul Dziendzielle, Franz, Julius and Wilhelm Jacobi, Hans Kahn, Gustav M\u00fcller, Franz Risse, Fritz Schulte, Hans Siebold, August T\u00f6nnesmann, Heinrich and Robert Unger, Fritz Weber and Franz Wendt. The name ''Borussia'' is [[Latin]] for [[Prussia]] but was taken from Borussia beer from the nearby Borussia brewery in Dortmund.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bvb.de/eng/BVB/History/1909| title=A turbulent founding on 19/12/1909| website=BVB Club Website| access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref> The team began playing in blue and white striped shirts with a red sash, and black shorts. In 1913, they donned the black and yellow stripes so familiar today.\n\nOver the next decades the club enjoyed only modest success playing in local leagues. They had a brush with bankruptcy in 1929 when an attempt to boost the club's fortunes by signing some paid professional footballers failed miserably and left the team deep in debt. They survived only through the generosity of a local supporter who covered the team's shortfall out of his own pocket.\n\nThe 1930s saw the rise of the [[Third Reich]], which restructured sports and football organisations throughout the nation to suit the regime's goals. ''Borussia'''s president was replaced when he refused to join the [[Nazi Party]], and a couple of members who surreptitiously used the club's offices to produce anti-Nazi pamphlets were executed in the last days of the war. The club did have greater success in the newly established [[Gauliga Westfalen]], but would have to wait until after [[World War II]] to make a breakthrough. It was during this time that Borussia developed its intense rivalry with [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] of suburban [[Gelsenkirchen]], the most successful side of the era (see ''[[Revierderby]]''). Like every other organisation in Germany, Borussia was dissolved by the Allied occupation authorities after the war in an attempt to distance the country's institutions from its so-recent Nazi past. There was a short-lived attempt to merge the club with two others&nbsp;\u2013 ''Werksportgemeinschaft Hoesch'' and ''Freier Sportverein 98''&nbsp;\u2013 as ''Sportgemeinschaft Borussia von 1898'', but it was as ''Ballspiel-Verein Borussia'' (''BVB'') that they made their first appearance in the national league final in 1949, where they lost 2\u20133 to [[VfR Mannheim]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===First national titles===\n[[File:Borussia Dortmund Performance Chart.png|450px|thumb|Historical chart of Borussia Dortmund league performance]]\nBetween 1946 and 1963, Borussia featured in the [[Oberliga West (1947\u201363)|Oberliga West]], a first division league which dominated German football through the late 1950s. In [[1949 German football championship|1949]], Borussia reached the [[1949 German football championship#Final|final]] in [[Stuttgart]] against [[VfR Mannheim]], which they lost 2\u20133 after extra time. The club claimed its first national title in [[1956 German football championship|1956]] with a 4\u20132 win against [[Karlsruher SC]]. One year later, Borussia defeated [[Hamburger SV]] 4\u20131 to win their [[1957 German football championship|second national title]]. After this coup, the three Alfredos ([[Alfred Prei\u00dfler]], [[Alfred Kelbassa]] and [[Alfred Niepieklo]]) were legends in Dortmund. In [[1963 German football championship|1963]], Borussia won the last edition of the [[List of German football champions#German football championships Postwar to the Bundesliga (1946\u201363)|German Football Championship]] (before the introduction of the new [[Bundesliga]]) to secure their third national title.\n\n===Bundesliga debut===\nIn 1962, the [[German Football Association|DFB]] met in Dortmund and voted to establish a professional football league in Germany, to begin play in August 1963 as the [[Bundesliga]]. Borussia Dortmund earned its place among the first sixteen clubs to play in the league by winning the last pre-Bundesliga national championship. Runners-up [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]] also earned an automatic berth. Dortmund's [[Friedhelm Konietzka]] scored the first-ever Bundesliga goal a minute into the match, which they would eventually lose 2\u20133 to [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]].\n\nIn [[1964\u201365 DFB-Pokal|1965]], Dortmund captured its first [[DFB-Pokal]]. In 1966, Dortmund won the [[1965\u201366 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] 2\u20131 against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in extra time, with the goals coming from [[Sigfried Held]] and [[Reinhard Libuda]]. In the same year, however, the team surrendered a commanding position atop the [[1965\u201366 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] by losing four of their last five league games and finishing second, three points behind champions [[TSV 1860 M\u00fcnchen|1860 M\u00fcnchen]]. Ironically, much of 1860 M\u00fcnchen's success came on the strength of the play of Konietzka, recently transferred from Dortmund.\n\nThe 1970s were characterised by financial problems, relegation from the Bundesliga in 1972, and the opening of the [[Westfalenstadion]], named after its home region [[Westphalia]] in 1974. The club earned its return to Bundesliga in 1976.\n\nDortmund continued to have financial problems through the 1980s. ''BVB'' avoided being relegated in 1986 by winning a third decisive playoff game against [[SC Fortuna K\u00f6ln|Fortuna K\u00f6ln]] after finishing the regular season in 16th place.  Dortmund did not enjoy any significant success again until a 4\u20131 DFB-Pokal win in [[1988\u201389 DFB-Pokal|1989]] against Werder Bremen. It was [[Horst K\u00f6ppel]]'s first trophy as a manager. Dortmund then won the [[1989 DFB-Supercup|1989 DFL-Supercup]] 4\u20133 against rivals [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].\n\n===Golden age \u2013 the 1990s===\nAfter a tenth-place finish in the Bundesliga in [[1990\u201391 Bundesliga|1991]], manager [[Horst K\u00f6ppel]] was let go and manager [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]] was hired.\n\nIn [[1991\u201392 Bundesliga|1992]], Hitzfeld led Borussia Dortmund to a second-place finish in the Bundesliga and would have won the title had [[VfB Stuttgart]] not won their last game to become champions instead.\n\nAlong with a fourth-place finish in the Bundesliga, Dortmund made it to the 1993 [[1992\u201393 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] [[1993 UEFA Cup Final|final]], which they lost 6\u20131 on aggregate to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. In spite of this result, Borussia walked away with [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]25&nbsp;million under the prize money pool system in place at the time for German sides participating in the Cup. Cash flush, Dortmund was able to sign players who later brought them numerous honours in the 1990s.\n\nUnder the [[Captain (association football)|captaincy]] of 1996 [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] [[Matthias Sammer]], Borussia Dortmund won back-to-back Bundesliga titles in [[1994\u201395 Bundesliga|1995]] and [[1995\u201396 Bundesliga|1996]]. Dortmund also won the [[DFL-Supercup]] against [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach|M\u00f6nchengladbach]] in [[1995 DFB-Supercup|1995]] and [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]] in [[1996 DFB-Supercup|1996]].\n\nIn [[1996\u201397 UEFA Champions League|1996\u201397]] the team reached its first [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League finals|European Cup final]]. In a memorable [[1997 UEFA Champions League Final|match]] at the [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympiastadion]] in [[Munich]], Dortmund faced the holders Juventus. [[Karl-Heinz Riedle]] put Dortmund ahead, shooting under goalkeeper [[Angelo Peruzzi]] from a cross by [[Paul Lambert]]. Riedle then made it two with a bullet header from a corner kick. In the second half, [[Alessandro Del Piero]] pulled one back for Juventus with a back heel. Then 20-year-old substitute and local boy [[Lars Ricken]] latched onto a through pass by [[Andreas M\u00f6ller]]. Only 16 seconds after coming on to the pitch, Ricken chipped Peruzzi in the Juventus goal from over 20 yards out with his first touch of the ball.

Poor financial management led to a heavy debt load and the sale of their Westfalenstadion grounds. The situation was compounded by failure to advance in the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League]], when the team was eliminated on penalties in the qualifying rounds by [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]. In 2003, Bayern Munich loaned \u20ac2&nbsp;million to Dortmund for several months to pay their payroll. Borussia was again driven to the brink of [[bankruptcy]] in 2005, the original \u20ac11 value of its shares having plummeted by over 80% on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]].\n\nAt this time [[Hans-Joachim Watzke]] was appointed CEO and streamlined the club. The response to the crisis included a 20% pay cut for all players.<ref>{{cite web|author=Von abendblatt.de |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/sport/fussball/article2179798/Hoeness-plaudert-Haben-BVB-zwei-Millionen-Euro-geliehen.html |title=Pikantes Geheimnis&nbsp;\u2013 Hoene\u00df plaudert: \"Haben BVB zwei Millionen Euro geliehen\"&nbsp;\u2013 Sport&nbsp;\u2013 Fu\u00dfball&nbsp;\u2013 Hamburger Abendblatt |date=6 February 2012 |publisher=Abendblatt.de |language=de |access-date=5 March 2013}}</ref> In 2006, in order to reduce debt, the [[Westfalenstadion]] was renamed \"Signal Iduna Park\" after a local insurance company. The naming rights agreement runs until 2021.\n\nDortmund suffered a miserable start to the [[2005\u201306 Bundesliga|2005\u201306]] season, but rallied to finish seventh. The club failed to gain a place in the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] via the Fair Play draw. The club's management recently indicated that the club again showed a profit; this was largely related to the sale of [[David Odonkor]] to [[Real Betis]] and [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Rosick\u00fd]] to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 Bundesliga|2006\u201307]] season, Dortmund unexpectedly faced serious [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] trouble for the first time in years. Dortmund went through three coaches and appointed [[Thomas Doll]] on 13 March 2007 after dropping to just one point above the relegation zone. [[Christoph Metzelder]] also left Borussia Dortmund on a free transfer.\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 Bundesliga|2007\u201308]] season, Dortmund lost to many smaller [[Bundesliga]] clubs. Despite finishing 13th in the Bundesliga table, Dortmund reached the [[2007\u201308 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] Final against Bayern Munich, where they lost 2\u20131 in extra time. The final appearance qualified Dortmund for the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] because Bayern already qualified for the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].

A four-part [[Amazon Prime Video]] documentary series was created, about the same season, named \"Inside Borussia Dortmund\".\n\nThe next season, Dortmund pulled off a few big-name signings with the intent of winning the Bundesliga title. Although they won the DFL Supercup, this was their only silverware this season. After a scrappy first half of the season, they changed their tactics and made a few more transfers in the January Window. They were eliminated in both the DFB-Pokal and the UEFA Champions League as well. Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Germany]], the season stopped abruptly. Once the restart occurred, Dortmund looked better but their performances were not enough to stop a dominant Bayern Munich side from grasping the Bundesliga title. They finished the 2019\u201320 season in second place after beating [[RB Leipzig]] in matchweek 33 due to a brace from [[Erling Haaland]].\n\nDortmund got off to a rather shaky start in the 2020\u201321 season. They lost the DFL-Supercup and had an inconsistent set of results in the Champions League and the Bundesliga. After a humiliating 5\u20131 defeat to Stuttgart in Matchday 11, Lucien Favre was relieved of his managerial duties. Assistant manager [[Edin Terzi\u0107 (footballer)|Edin Terzi\u0107]] was placed as the caretaker for the rest of the season. Under Terzi\u0107, Dortmund finished third on the final matchday of the Bundesliga and was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in a clash against Manchester City.
