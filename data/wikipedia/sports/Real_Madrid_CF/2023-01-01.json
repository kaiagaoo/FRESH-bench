Among the dissenters were [[Juli\u00e1n Palacios]], recognized as the first Real Madrid president, [[Juan Padr\u00f3s]] and [[Carlos Padr\u00f3s]], the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid.

As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to [[Francoist Spain|Franco's regime]]. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto ''M\u00e9s que un club'' (''English: More than a club'') because of its alleged connection to [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]] as well as to [[progressivism|progressive]] beliefs.<ref>Ball, Phil p. 88</ref>\n\nThere's an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939\u201375) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid|Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n]] and Madrid FC (that recovered its ''royal'' name after the fall of the Republic and again became ''Real Madrid CF''). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed ''CF Barcelona'' succeed as \"Spanish team\" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid weren't particularly successful, winning two [[Copa del Rey|Copa del General\u00edsimo]] titles and a [[Copa Eva Duarte]]; Barcelona claimed three [[List of Spanish football champions|league titles]], one Copa del General\u00edsimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's [[Real Madrid CF#Early years (1902\u20131943)|11\u20131 home win against Barcelona]] in the [[1943 Copa del General\u00edsimo|Copa del General\u00edsimo]], where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of [[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]] to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u (footballer)|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]]'s \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernab\u00e9u, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Franco's forces]], saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.realmadrid.com/en/about-real-madrid/history/presidents/santiago-bernabeu|title=SANTIAGO BERNAB\u00c9U 1943\u00b71978|work=Real Madrid C.F.|publisher=realmadrid.com|access-date=1 July 2022}}</ref> These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. [[Fernando Maria Castiella]], who served as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Spain)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] soon followed. Under his rule, [[List of Real Madrid CF records and statistics#Honours|Real Madrid had won]] 14 league titles, 6 Copa del General\u00edsimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 [[Latin Cup]]s and 1 [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]].

Di St\u00e9fano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for [[Club Deportivo Los Millonarios|Los Millionarios]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Colombia]], during a players' strike in his native [[Argentina]]. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di St\u00e9fano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Mu\u00f1oz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di St\u00e9fano play the 1953\u201354 and 1955\u201356 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954\u201355 and 1956\u201357 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di St\u00e9fano moved to ''Los Blancos'', signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di St\u00e9fano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.<ref name=\"di Stefano\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28204560 |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Football &#124; Alfredo Di Stefano: Did General Franco halt Barcelona transfer?|work=BBC News |date=7 July 2014 |access-date=2 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nDi St\u00e9fano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona.

The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the [[Campeonato Regional Centro#1906\u201307|regional championship]], with Real Madrid winning 2\u20131.

In any case, during this period Atl\u00e9tico became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"<ref name=\"goal.com\"/> Thus, Atl\u00e9tico fans regularly chanted that Real were ''\"El equipo del gobierno, la verg\u00fcenza del pa\u00eds\"'' \u2013 \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" \u2013 and allegedly adopted a more [[left-wing politics|left-wing slant]] (tempered by the rise of [[ultras]] culture, and [[Rayo Vallecano]]'s presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/why-everything-you-know-about-madrid-derby-might-be-wrong|title = Why everything you know about the Madrid derby might be wrong|date = 7 January 2015|access-date = 14 February 2015|website = FourFourTwo|last = Ballout|first = Richard}}</ref><ref name=struggle>{{Cite web|url = http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/latest/franco-real-madrid-and-spanish-football-s-eternal-power-struggle-1-2564913|title = Franco, Real Madrid and Spanish football's eternal power struggle|date = 7 October 2012|access-date = 14 February 2015|website = The Scotsman|last = FITZPATRICK|first = Richard}}</ref>\n\nThe rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the [[1958\u201359 European Cup|European Cup]] when the two clubs met in the semi-finals.
