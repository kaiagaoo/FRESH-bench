Buffalo had been left out of the league since the All-Americans (by that point renamed the Bisons) folded in 1929; the Bills were no less than the third professional non-NFL team to compete in the city before the merger, following the [[Buffalo Indians|Indians/Tigers]] of the early 1940s and [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|an earlier team named the Bills]], originally the Bisons, in the late 1940s in the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC).\n\nFollowing the AFL\u2013NFL merger, the Bills were generally mediocre in the 1970s, but featured All-Pro running back [[O. J. Simpson]]. After being pushed to the brink of failure in the mid-1980s, the collapse of the [[United States Football League]] and a series of highly drafted players such as [[Jim Kelly]] (who initially played for the USFL instead of the Bills), [[Thurman Thomas]], [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]] and [[Darryl Talley]] allowed the Bills to rebuild into a perennial contender in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, a period in which the team won four consecutive [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championships]]; the team nevertheless lost all four subsequent [[Super Bowl]]s, records in both categories that still stand.\n\nThe rise of the division rival [[New England Patriots]] under [[Bill Belichick]] and [[Tom Brady]], along with numerous failed attempts at rebuilding in the 2000s and 2010s, helped prevent the Bills from reaching the playoffs in seventeen consecutive seasons between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year drought that was the longest active playoff drought in all major professional sports at the time. On October 8, 2014, [[Buffalo Sabres]] owners Terry and Kim Pegula received unanimous approval to acquire the Bills during the NFL owners' meetings, becoming the second ownership group of the team after team founder [[Ralph Wilson]].<ref name=\"SesslerBills\" /> Under head coach Sean McDermott, the Bills broke the playoff drought, appearing in the playoffs for four of the next five seasons. The team earned its first division championship and playoff wins since 1995 during the 2020 season, aided by Brady's departure to [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa Bay]] and out of the AFC East as well as the Bills' own development of a core of talent including [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]], [[Stefon Diggs]], and [[Tre'Davious White]].\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n[[File:Buffalo Bills classic logo.svg|thumb|left|150px|Bills logo, 1962\u20131973]]\n\nFor their first two seasons, the Bills wore uniforms based on those of the [[Detroit Lions]] at the time.

The team switched to blue jerseys with red and white shoulder stripes similar to those worn by the Buffalo Bisons AHL hockey team of the same era.

A darker shade of blue was introduced as the main jersey color, and nickel gray was introduced as an accent color. Both the blue and white jerseys featured red side panels. The white jerseys included a dark blue shoulder yoke and royal blue numbers. The helmet remained primarily red with one navy blue, two nickel, two royal blue, two white stripes, and white face mask. A new logo, a stylized \"B\" consisting of two bullets and a more detailed buffalo head on top, was proposed and had been released (it can be seen on a few baseball caps that were released for sale), but fan backlash led to the team retaining the running bison logo. The helmet logo adopted in 1974\u2014a charging royal blue bison, with a red streak, white horn and eyeball\u2014remained unchanged.\n\nIn [[2005 Buffalo Bills season|2005]], the Bills revived the standing bison helmet and uniform of the mid-1960s as a throwback uniform.\n\nThe Bills usually wore the all-blue combination at home and the all-white combination on the road when not wearing the throwback uniforms.

Though the Bills and [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] both originated in the [[American Football League]], the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team while the Bills were one of the original eight teams. The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent (the Bills defeated the Dolphins in their first matchup of the 1980s). Fortunes changed in the following decades with the rise of [[Jim Kelly]] as Buffalo's franchise quarterback, and though Kelly and Dolphins quarterback [[Dan Marino]] shared a competitive rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Bills became dominant in the 1990s. Things have since cooled down after the retirements of Kelly and Marino and the [[Brady\u2013Belichick era|rise of the New England Patriots]], but Miami remains a fierce rival of the Bills, coming in second place in a recent poll of Buffalo's primary rival,<ref name = \"2017primaryrivalpoll\"/> and the two teams have typically been close to each other in win\u2013loss records. Miami leads the overall series 62\u201356\u20131 as of 2022, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 4\u20131, including a win in the [[1992\u201393 NFL playoffs|1992 AFC Championship Game]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=17%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. Miami Dolphins Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB|access-date=September 13, 2017|archive-date=February 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225104228/https://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=17%7CBuffalo|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====New England Patriots====\n{{main|Bills\u2013Patriots rivalry}}\n[[File:CJ_Spiller_Patriots_at_Bills.jpg|thumb|220px|Bills RB [[C.

The Bills had stationery and various other team merchandise showing a running player wearing that number, and it was not supposed to represent any specific person, but the 'spirit of the team.' In the first three decades of the team's existence, the number 31 was only seen once: in 1969, when reserve running back [[Preston Ridlehuber]] damaged his number 36 jersey during a game, equipment manager Tony Marchitte gave him the number 31 jersey to wear while repairing the number 36. The number 31 was not issued again until 1990 when first round draft choice [[James Williams (defensive back)|James (J.D.) Williams]] wore it for his first two seasons; it has since been returned to general circulation, currently worn as of 2022 by [[Dean Marlowe]].\n\nNumber 32 had been withdrawn from circulation, but not retired, after [[O. J. Simpson]]. Former owner [[Ralph Wilson]] insisted on not reissuing the number, even after Simpson's [[O. J. Simpson murder case|highly publicized murder case]] and later [[O. J. Simpson robbery case|robbery conviction]]. The number was placed back into circulation in 2019 with [[Senorise Perry]] wearing the number that year; as of 2022, practice squad cornerback Kyler McMichael uses the number.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/05/21/buffalo-bills-oj-simpson-jersey-senorise-perry |title=Bills allow Senorise Perry to wear Simpson's No. 32 |last=Axson |first=Scooby |date=May 21, 2019 |website=Sports Illustrated |language=en |access-date=May 21, 2019 |archive-date=May 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522061401/https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/05/21/buffalo-bills-oj-simpson-jersey-senorise-perry |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nNumber 15 was historically only issued sparingly after the retirement of [[Jack Kemp]],<ref name=\"reduced\" /> but was later returned to general circulation. Receiver [[Jake Kumerow]] wears the number as of 2021.\n\nNumber 1 has also only rarely been used, for reasons never explained. While there is no proper explanation, [[Tommy Hughitt]] was a [[player-coach]] for the early [[Buffalo (NFL)|Buffalo]] teams in the [[New York Pro Football League]] and NFL from 1918 to 1924 and was both a major on-field success and a fixture in Buffalo culture after his retirement as a politician and auto salesman. Hugitt was reported to wear number 1 during this time. Wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] is the most recent Bill to wear the number; prior to his arrival in 2021, it had been 19 years since it had been worn in the regular season, when kicker [[Mike Hollis]] wore it in 2002.\n\n===Ralph C.
