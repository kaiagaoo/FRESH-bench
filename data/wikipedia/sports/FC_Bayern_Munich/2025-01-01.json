Overall, Bayern have won six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (a German record), winning their sixth title in the [[2020 UEFA Champions League Final|2020 final]] as part of the [[Treble (association football)|Treble]], and it became the second European club to achieve this feat twice.

Eventually, the stadium had a capacity of 63,000 for national matches and 59,000 for international occasions such as European Cup competitions. Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, betraying the stadium's track and field heritage.

The two teams fought closely for the Bundesliga title in the early 2010s, and met in the [[2013 UEFA Champions League final]]. The rivalry between the clubs grew during the 1990s, as Dortmund's stature increased to challenge perennial title favourites Bayern, winning two [[Bundesliga]] titles in [[1994\u201395 Bundesliga|1994\u201395]] and [[1995\u201396 Bundesliga|1995\u201396]].\n\nIn 1996, Bayern captain [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]] accused [[Germany national football team|Germany]] teammate [[Andreas M\u00f6ller]] of being a 'crybaby', wiping imaginary tears from his face; M\u00f6ller reacted by slapping Matth\u00e4us. At the end of that season, Dortmund won the [[1997 UEFA Champions League final]] which happened to be played at the [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympiastadion]], Bayern's home ground.\n\nThe teams met in the quarter-finals of the [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|next edition]] of the Champions League, and Dortmund prevailed over two legs thanks to a single goal from [[St\u00e9phane Chapuisat]]. That summer, Bayern hired Dortmund's successful coach [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]] to work for them. Tempers flared twice during Bayern and Dortmund's second meeting in the [[1998\u201399 Bundesliga]], as Bayern goalkeeper [[Oliver Kahn]] first attempted a flying kung-fu kick at Chapuisat, and later appeared to bite [[Heiko Herrlich]]'s ear.\n\nIn the early 2000s both clubs remained successful, as Bayern lost one Champions League final ([[1999 UEFA Champions League final|1999]]) then won another ([[2001 UEFA Champions League final|2001]]) in addition to more domestic success, while Dortmund won the [[2001\u201302 Bundesliga]] and reached the [[2002 UEFA Cup final|UEFA Cup final]] the same year. An angry 2001 league meeting between the pair was notable for ten yellow cards and three red being shown (a Bundesliga record for indiscipline). However, Dortmund soon fell heavily into debt, and a \u20ac2m loan from Bayern in 2004 was a major reason for them being saved from [[bankruptcy]].\n\nOn 19 April 2008, the two sides clashed in the [[2008 DFB-Pokal final]] for the first time that took place in [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Berlin]]. [[Luca Toni]] opened the scoring after eleven minutes, but [[Mladen Petric]] drew Dortmund level in stoppage time, forcing thirty additional minutes. The Italian completed his double in extra time, thus lifting Bayern to cup glory.\n\n=== European Rivals ===\n[[File:BVB-Fans in Wembley.jpg|thumb|right|Bayern Munich won 2\u20131 against [[Borussia Dortmund]] to win the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League]] on 25 May 2013.]]\n\nAmongst Bayern's chief European rivals are [[FC Barcelona]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-09-13 |title=There's more to Barcelona-Bayern than one 8-2 result; this is a rivalry with a dramatic history |url=https://www.espn.in/football/story/_/id/37620655/there-more-barcelona-bayern-munich-8-2-result-rivalry-dramatic-history |access-date=2024-12-01 |website=ESPN |language=en}}</ref> [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]],<ref>{{cite web |date=1 September 2007 |title=Bayern seek maximum return in Hamburg |url=http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/news/news/2007/13184.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221220135/http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/news/news/2007/13184.php |archive-date=21 December 2008 |access-date=15 August 2008 |publisher=FC Bayern Munich Official Website }}</ref> [[AC Milan]],<ref>{{cite web |date=9 March 2007 |title=Bayern paired with old foes Milan |url=http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/news/news/2007/11115.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207093040/http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/news/news/2007/11115.php |archive-date=7 December 2008 |access-date=15 August 2008 }}</ref> and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref name=\"bayernhistory0003\">{{cite web |year=2008 |title=Emotion, drama and glory |url=http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/company/club/history/00373.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221215734/http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/en/company/club/history/00373.php |archive-date=21 December 2008 |access-date=15 August 2008 |publisher=FC Bayern Munich Official Website}}</ref> [[Bayern Munich\u2013Real Madrid rivalry|Real Madrid versus Bayern]] is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 28 matches.
