Originally it consisted of the stylised letters F, C, B, M, which were woven into one symbol. The original crest was blue. The colours of [[Bavaria]] were included for the first time in 1954.<ref name=\"crestcolor\" /> The crest from 1919 to 1924 denotes \"Bayern FA\", whereby \"FA\" stands for ''Fu\u00dfball-Abteilung'', i.e., Football Department; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department.\n\nThe modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps.<ref name=\"crestcolor\" /> While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre, and FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours.\n\n{{gallery\n|title=Bayern Munich logo history\n|width=120\n|height=100\n|align=center\n|File:FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen (Altes Emblem).png |1901\n|File:Bayern M\u00fcnchen Logo (1901-1906).svg|1902\u20131906\n|File:Bayern M\u00fcnchen Logo (1906-1919).svg|1906\u20131919\n|File:Bayern M\u00fcnchen Logo (1919-1924).svg|1919\u20131924\n|File:Bayern M\u00fcnchen Logo (1924-1954).svg|1925\u20131938, 1945\u20131954\n|File:FC-Bayern-M\u00fcnchen-logo-1938-1945.jpg|1938\u20141945\n|File:Logo Bayern Munchen(1954-1996).svg|1954\u20131996\n|File:Bayern M\u00fcnchen Logo (1996-2002).svg|1996\u20132002\n|File:Logo FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen.svg|2002\u20132017\n|File:FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen logo (2017).svg|2017\u2013\n}}\n\n==Stadiums==\n[[File:Model of stadium at Leopoldstrasse.JPG|thumb|Model of Bayern's first stadium, their home from 1906 to 1924]]\n\nBayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of [[Munich]].

Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, betraying the stadium's track and field heritage.

The club's least successful coach was [[S\u00f8ren Lerby]], who won less than a third of his matches in charge and presided over the club's near-relegation in the 1991\u201392 campaign.\n\nOn 3 November 2019, Bayern sacked [[Niko Kova\u010d]] after a 5\u20131 loss to [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and appointed [[Hansi Flick]] as a coach. Initially, Flick was installed as caretaker coach only, however on 15 November, after Flick's team had won 4\u20130 against [[Borussia Dortmund]], Bayern announced that Flick would be in charge at least until Christmas 2019.<ref>{{Cite news |date=15 November 2019 |title=Bayern Munich: Hansi Flick to remain in charge 'until Christmas at least' |work=BBC Sport
