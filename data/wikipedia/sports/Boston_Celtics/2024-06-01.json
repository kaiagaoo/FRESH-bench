Led by Russell, [[point guard]] Bob Cousy, and [[1956\u201357 NBA season|1956\u201357]] [[NBA Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] [[Tom Heinsohn]], the Celtics won their first NBA championship in [[1957 NBA Finals|1957]].\n\nRussell, along with a talented supporting cast of future [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] including Tom Heinsohn, Don Nelson, [[K. C. Jones]], [[John Havlicek]], [[Sam Jones (basketball, born 1933)|Sam Jones]], [[Satch Sanders]], and [[Bill Sharman]], would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966. After Russell retired, as a player-coach, and the first African-American head coach in any US sport, in 1969, the team entered a period of rebuilding. In the mid-1970s, the Celtics became contenders once again, winning championships in [[1974 NBA Finals|1974]] and [[1976 NBA Finals|1976]] under the leadership of head coach Tom Heinsohn with center [[Dave Cowens]], forward [[John Havlicek]], and point guard [[Jo Jo White]]. In the 1980s, the Celtics returned to dominance. The team experienced a renewed rivalry with the [[Showtime (basketball)|\"Showtime\" Lakers]], who were led by [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. Anchored by the \"Big Three\" of Larry Bird, [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], and [[Robert Parish]], the Celtics won championships in [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]], [[1984 NBA Finals|1984]], and [[1986 NBA Finals|1986]], the latter two with head coach K. C. Jones.\n\nAfter the retirements of Bird and McHale, the departure of Parish, and the untimely deaths of 1986 draft pick [[Len Bias]] and star player [[Reggie Lewis]], the Celtics struggled through the 1990s and much of the early 2000s. It was not until the Celtics assembled a new \"Big Three\" of [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Paul Pierce]], and [[Ray Allen]] that they found success once again. Under the leadership of head coach [[Doc Rivers]], the team beat the Lakers to win a championship in [[2008 NBA Finals|2008]]. The Celtics reached the NBA Finals again in [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]], but lost to Los Angeles in a seven-game series. By the start of the 2013\u201314 season, Garnett, Pierce, and Allen were no longer with the team. In 2013, Pierce and Garnett were traded to the [[Brooklyn Nets]] for three future first round picks, two of those picks later became the foundation of \"The Jays\" era, drafting [[Jaylen Brown]] and [[Jayson Tatum]] with back-to-back #3 overall picks using the assets acquired from Brooklyn in the 2016 and 2017 NBA drafts. Led by \"The Jays\", the team reached the Conference Finals six times during an eight-year span beginning in the 2016\u201317 season and returned to the NBA Finals in 2022 and 2024, losing to the [[Golden State Warriors]] in 2022.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{main|History of the Boston Celtics}}\n\n===1946\u20131950: early years===\nThe Boston Celtics were formed on June 6, 1946, by [[Boston Garden-Arena Corporation]] president [[Walter A.

When asked about the fan barbs being traded, [[Kenyon Martin]] stated, \"Our fans hate them, their fans hate us.\" [[Bill Walton]] said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the \"beginning of the next great NBA rivalry\" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of [[Rajon Rondo]], Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and [[Kevin Garnett]] were fined.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/sports/basketball/celtics-rajon-rondo-suspended-2-games-for-melee.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | title=Suspension and 2 Fines After Brawl | first1=May | last1=Peter | date=November 30, 2012 | access-date=February 6, 2017 | archive-date=November 8, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108035905/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/sports/basketball/celtics-rajon-rondo-suspended-2-games-for-melee.html?_r=0 | url-status=live }}</ref> The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and [[Paul Pierce]] to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]] teams.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nets/bondy-prokhorov-mentality-reminiscent-boss-article-1.1403107 |title=Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov's win-at-all-costs mentality is reminiscent of late George Steinbrenner |newspaper=NY Daily News |date=July 18, 2013 |access-date=October 16, 2013 |location=New York |archive-date=October 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022143049/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nets/bondy-prokhorov-mentality-reminiscent-boss-article-1.1403107 |url-status=live }}</ref> Celtics announcer [[Sean Grande]] said \"It's almost as if you found a great home for these guys.

Brooklyn would win just one playoff series with Garnett and Pierce, neither of whom were with the team by the close of the [[2014\u201315 Brooklyn Nets season|2014\u20132015 season]]. The Celtics would use Brooklyn's draft picks to acquire [[Jaylen Brown]] and [[Jayson Tatum]] through the draft in [[2016 NBA draft|2016]] and [[2017 NBA Draft|2017]] respectively and [[Kyrie Irving]] via trade, en route to consecutive appearances in the Eastern Conference Finals in [[2017 NBA playoffs|2017]] and [[2018 NBA playoffs|2018]].

It is one of many rivalries between Boston and New York teams, most notably the [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox]] in [[Major League Baseball]]. Boston and New York are also the only two original NBA franchises that have remained in the same city for the duration of their existence.

Crowder then began to exchange words with then Wizards coach [[Randy Wittman]]. It began to escalate that off-season when the Celtics were trying to sign [[Al Horford]]. It was publicly reported that Jae Crowder emphasized that the Celtics beat the Wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign with them rather than Washington. In their first meeting of the 2016\u201317 season, Wall hit [[Marcus Smart]] in the back-court when they were up by 20 late in the 4th quarter. Wall was hit with a Flagrant 2 foul and was promptly ejected. Smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with Wall. Their words continued even after being separated with Wall telling Smart to meet him out back after the game. No incident was reported between the two following the game. In their next meeting, the Celtics won 117\u2013108. However, after the game Wall and Crowder exchanged words in front of the Wizards bench. Crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at Wall's nose and Wall tried to fight back with a slap. Teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms. Police officers had to be on guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation. [[Otto Porter]] is quoted as calling the Celtics as dirty. [[Isaiah Thomas (basketball)|Isaiah Thomas]] replied \"If playing hard is dirty, then I guess we are a dirty team.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/boston/celtics/post/_/id/4725574/how-the-celtics-and-wizards-became-the-nbas-most-unexpected-rivalry|title=How Celtics-Wizards became the NBA's most unexpected rivalry|work=ESPN.com|access-date=April 2, 2018|archive-date=April 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402225914/http://www.espn.com/blog/boston/celtics/post/_/id/4725574/how-the-celtics-and-wizards-became-the-nbas-most-unexpected-rivalry|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn their next game in January, the Wizards wore all black to enter the game. The notion was that it is similar to the attire of a funeral. Their decision worked as they defeated the Celtics 123\u2013108. The two teams would go on to meet in the Conference Semifinals in the 2017 Playoffs. In Game 1, [[Markieff Morris]] landed on Horford's ankle after shooting a jumpshot. Morris sprained his ankle and had to miss the rest of the game which was a 123\u2013111 loss. Morris believed that Horford did this intentionally. In Game 2, Morris retaliated by grabbing Horford by the waist and pushed him into the seats.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wizards-insider/wp/2017/12/22/things-change-but-nba-hopes-wizards-celtics-rivalry-still-brings-christmas-magic/|title=Things change, but NBA hopes Wizards-Celtics rivalry still brings Christmas magic|last=Buckner|first=Candace|date=December 24, 2017|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=April 2, 2018|issn=0190-8286|archive-date=April 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402225807/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wizards-insider/wp/2017/12/22/things-change-but-nba-hopes-wizards-celtics-rivalry-still-brings-christmas-magic/|url-status=live}}</ref> In Game 3, [[Kelly Olynyk]] set a hard screen on [[Kelly Oubre Jr.|Kelly Oubre]].
