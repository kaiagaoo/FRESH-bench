[[1893 St. Louis Browns season|In 1893]], the Browns moved to a new ballpark five blocks northwest of Sportsman's Park which would serve as their home from 1893 to 1920.

In 1953, the [[Anheuser-Busch|Anheuser-Busch Brewery]] purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased Sportsman's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium, later becoming Busch I. The Browns then left St. Louis for [[Baltimore]] after the season, becoming the Orioles. The Cardinals built [[Busch Memorial Stadium]], or Busch II, in downtown St. Louis, opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005.<ref name=\"CardinalsBallparks\" /> It was built as the [[multi-purpose stadium]] home of both the baseball Cardinals and the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|NFL football Cardinals]], who are now the [[Arizona Cardinals]]; the NFL's [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] also played the first four games of their home schedule upon their arrival in St. Louis in 1995. The current Busch Stadium was constructed partly atop the site of Busch Memorial Stadium.\n\n===Spring training===\nThe Cardinals home field in [[spring training]] is [[Roger Dean Stadium]] in [[Jupiter, Florida]]. They share the complex, which opened in 1998, with the [[Miami Marlins]].

The first logo associated with the Cardinals was an interlocking \"SL\" that appeared on the team's caps and or sleeves as early as 1899 or 1900 (depending on the source). Those early uniforms usually featured the name \"St. Louis\" on white home and gray road uniforms which both had [[Cardinal (color)|cardinal red]] accents. During an 1899 road trip to Chicago, a girl in the stands remarked, \"Oh, isn't that a lovely shade of cardinal.\" The team, known as the Perfectos at the time, changed its name to Cardinals the following season. In 1920, the \"SL\" largely disappeared from the team's uniforms, and for the next 20 years the team wore caps that were white with red striping and a red bill.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/uniforms.asp?city=St.%20Louis&league=NL&sort=year&increment=9&pos=19 | title=National Baseball Hall of Fame \u2013 Dressed to the Nines \u2013 Uniform Database }}</ref><ref name=SABRhistory>{{cite web|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/topic/st-louis-cardinals-team-ownership-history/|title=St. Louis Cardinals team ownership history|author1=Mark Stangl|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, the Cardinals wore uniforms for the first time that featured two [[Northern cardinal|cardinal]] birds perched on a [[baseball bat]] over the name \"Cardinals\" with the letter \"C\" of the word hooked over the bat. The concept of the birds originated after [[List of St. Louis Cardinals owners and executives|general manager]] [[Branch Rickey]] noticed a colorful cardboard arrangement featuring cardinal birds on a table in a [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian]] [[Church (building)|church]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], at which he was speaking. The arrangement's production was by a woman named Allie May Schmidt. Schmidt's father, a [[graphic designer]], helped Rickey make the logo a familiar staple on Cardinals uniforms.<ref>{{cite news|last=Getzenburg|first=Alaina|title=Schmidt's vision inspired iconic red bird logo|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/allie-may-schmidt-inspired-cardinals-logo/c-254904614|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|date=September 18, 2017|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> While the team had been known as the Cardinals for over 20 years by then, this logo changed the perception from the color to the bird.<ref name=SABRhistory/> The now-famous \"birds on the bat\" design initially appeared with the birds perched on a black bat and \"Cardinals\" in printed letters. An alternate version of this logo with \"St. Louis\" replacing \"Cardinals\" appeared in 1930 and was the primary logo in 1931 and 1932 before \"Cardinals\" returned. In 1940, the now-familiar \"{{sm|StL}}\" logo was introduced on the team's caps. The interlocking \"{{sm|StL}}\" has undergone several slight modifications over the years but has appeared on the team's caps every year since. The first appearance of the \"STL\" in 1940 coincided with the introduction of navy blue as a uniform color. From 1940 until 1955, the team wore navy blue caps with red bills and a red interlocking \"{{sm|StL}}\" while the jerseys featured both cardinal red and navy blue accents. In 1951, the \"birds on the bat\" logo was changed to feature a yellow baseball bat.<ref name=\"Cardsunis\">{{cite web | url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/uniforms.asp?lowYear=1882&highYear=2008&city=St.%20Louis&league=NL&sort=year&increment=18&pos=19 | title=Cardinals uniforms | work=Baseball Hall of Fame Uniform Database | access-date=May 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, the Cardinals changed their caps to solid blue with a red \"{{sm|StL}}\", removing the red bill. Also, for that season only, the Cardinals wore a script \"Cardinals\" wordmark on their uniforms excluding the \"birds on the bat\". An updated version of the \"birds on the bat\" logo returned in 1957 with the word \"Cardinals\" written in cursive beneath the bat; this logo, with some incremental changes along the way, has been the team's logo since. In 1962, the Cardinals became the first National League team (and the second in all of Major League Baseball after the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1960) to display players' names on the back of their jerseys. In 1964, while retaining their blue caps for road games, the Cardinals changed their home caps to all red with first a blue, than a white, interlocking \"{{sm|StL}}\". The next year, the red caps were the only cap worn by the team full-time. In 1967, the birds on the bat emblem on the jersey was again tweaked, making the birds more realistic and changing the position of their tails relative to the bat and this version remained on all Cardinals game jerseys through 1997.\n\nIn 1971, following the trend in baseball at the time, the Cardinals replaced the traditional flannel front-button shirts and pants with belts with new pullover knit jerseys and beltless elastic waist pants. In 1973, the crew-neck collar became a V-neck. Another trend in baseball led the Cardinals to change their road uniforms from gray to light blue from 1976 to 1984; the player numbers were worn on the sleeves in 1979 and 1980. In 1992, the Cardinals returned to wearing traditional button-down shirts and pants with belts. That same year, they also brought back the all-navy cap with a red \"{{sm|StL}}\", which were last worn in 1964, for use on the road only while wearing the same red and white cap for home games.\n\nIn 1998, the \"birds on the bat\" was updated for the first time in 30 years with more detailed birds and bolder letters. That year, St. Louis introduced a cap featuring a single cardinal bird perched on a bat worn for Sunday home games only. Up until 2020, the alternate \"bird\" caps were paired with their primary \"{{sm|StL}}\" red batting helmets, but in the 2021 season, the Cardinals added a new helmet to match their home Sunday alternate caps. The new birds on the bat design was modified again the next year, with yellow beaks and white eyes replacing the red beaks and yellow eyes of the 1998 version. Uniform numbers also returned to the front of the jerseys in 1999 after a two-year absence.<ref name=\"Cardsunis\" />\n\nOn November 16, 2012, the Cardinals unveiled a new alternate uniform to be worn at home games on Saturdays beginning with the 2013 season. The modified jersey, cream-colored with red trim on the sleeves and down the front, retains the \"birds on the bat\" but is the first since 1932 in which \"St. Louis\" is used instead of \"Cardinals\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Langosch|first=Jenifer|title=City is key to Cardinals' alternate home jersey|url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121115&content_id=40305046&vkey=news_stl&c_id=stl|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|date=November 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119103550/http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121115&content_id=40305046&vkey=news_stl&c_id=stl|archive-date=November 19, 2012|access-date=April 19, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> 2013 also saw the team adopt their red caps as their main cap for both home and away games for the first time since 1991; the navy cap was retained as an alternate, used when visiting other teams with red home caps.<ref name=\"Cardsunis\" />\n\nStarting with the 2019 season, the Cardinals have worn updated powder blue alternate uniforms during Saturday road games.

The red-based uniform with white pants maintained the trademark \"birds on the bat\" logo in front, but with the script \"The Lou\" in white trimmed in navy blue instead of either the city or team name. \"The Lou\" paid homage to rapper [[Nelly]], a St. Louis native who once coined the city's nickname on his 2000 single [[Country Grammar (Hot Shit)|Country Grammar]]. Darker red wavy pinstripes were an allusion to the [[Mississippi River]] where St. Louis is situated.

The Cubs lead the series 1,253\u20131,196, through October 2021, while the Cardinals lead in [[National League (baseball)|National League]] pennants with 19 against the Cubs' 17. The Cubs have won 11 of those pennants in Major League Baseball's Modern Era (1901\u2013present), while all 19 of the Cardinals' pennants have been won since 1926. The Cardinals also have an edge when it comes to [[World Series]] successes, having won 11 championships to the Cubs' 3.

The Royals advanced to the World Series, where they faced and ultimately defeated the [[2015 New York Mets season|New York Mets]], while the Cardinals lost in the NLDS.

At one time, owing to the Cardinals' status as a \"regional\" franchise, the Cardinals radio network reached almost half of the country.\n\nThe 2011 season marked the Cardinals' return to KMOX following five seasons on [[KTRS (AM)|KTRS]] (550 AM), a station which is 50 percent owned by the Cardinals. With a partnership spanning seven decades, and continuously since 1954, its conclusion was realized after the 2005 season when the then owners of KMOX, [[CBS Radio]], and the Cardinals failed to reach terms on a new rights agreement. However, frustrated by the underpowered coverage of 5,000-watt KTRS, the Cardinals reached a new deal with KMOX in 2011.\n\nStarting in 2013 (at age 74), [[Mike Shannon]] started reducing his workload. As of the 2016 season, he only called home games for the Cardinals. As of the 2019 season, his 47th in the broadcast booth, he surpassed Jack Buck, his long-time broadcast companion, as the longest-tenured Cardinal broadcaster.\n\nOn January 14, 2021, Shannon announced that the upcoming season, his 50th season in the broadcast booth, would be his last.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/cardinal-beat/cardinals-plan-season-long-celebration-for-retiring-broadcaster-shannon/article_8788a2b6-2d7b-5bb8-9ea4-2d917fe47d40.html |title=Cardinals plan season-long celebration for retiring broadcaster Shannon |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=March 18, 2021 |access-date=March 27, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\nSince 2000, Cardinals telecasts have generated the top three in ratings in MLB every season.<ref name=\"Ratings among highest\" /> [[Bally Sports Midwest]] airs all games in [[High-definition television|high-definition]] and is the team's exclusive television broadcaster, with the exception of selected [[MLB on Fox|Saturday afternoon games]] on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (via its St. Louis affiliate, [[KTVI]]) or ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' on [[ESPN]].
