The Yankees have also had historical rivalries with former crosstown National League teams the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, and current crosstown rivals the New York Mets. The much storied [[Dodgers-Yankees rivalry]] goes back to the Dodgers' tenure in Brooklyn. The two teams have met in the World Series 11 times including four matchups since the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles in 1958. The Yankees also forged an unlikely rivalry with the [[Cleveland Guardians]], built by stark financial contrasts between the two teams, a fatal on-field death in 1920, and heated pennant races and postseason matchups in subsequent years. During the late 1990s, the Yankees built a rivalry with the [[Seattle Mariners]] as the two teams met in the postseason three times near the end of the decade. Most recently the team has developed a rivalry with the Houston Astros, fueled in part by the [[Houston Astros sign stealing scandal]], believed by some Yankee fans to have contributed to their team's loss in the 2017 ALCS.<ref name=HOUNYY>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2021/07/11/bitter-yankees-astros-rivalry-is-exactly-what-mlb-needs-a-lot-more-of/|title=Bitter Yankees-Astros rivalry is exactly what MLB needs a lot more of|work=[[NY Post]]|date=July 12, 2021 }}</ref> The two teams have met in the postseason four times since 2015, and have pursued the same free agents and shared vitriol between both fanbases.\n\n===Boston Red Sox===\n{{main|Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry}}\nThe Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry is one of the oldest, most famous, and fiercest [[List of sports rivalries|rivalries in professional sports]].{{sfn|Shaughnessy|2005|page=21}}{{sfn|Frommer|Frommer|2004|page=78}}<ref name=UltimateRivalry>{{cite news|title=Sport's ultimate rivalry;
