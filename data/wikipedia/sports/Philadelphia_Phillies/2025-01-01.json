The team has played 122 consecutive seasons since the [[1903 World Series|first modern World Series]] and 142 seasons since its 1883 establishment.

Since the start of the [[1969 Major League Baseball season|Divisional Era in 1969]], however, the Phillies have emerged as one of MLB's most successful teams, winning 12 division titles, including five consecutive divisional titles between 2007 and 2011, [[List of National League pennant winners|six National League pennants]], and [[List of World Series champions|two World Series championships]]. \n\nThe franchise's founding in Philadelphia in 1883 replaced the [[Worcester Worcesters|team from Worcester, Massachusetts]], in the National League. The team has played at several stadiums in the city, including [[Recreation Park (Philadelphia)|Recreation Park]] (1883\u20131886), the [[Baker Bowl]] (1887\u20131938), [[Shibe Park]] (later renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953 in honor of longtime [[Philadelphia Athletics]] manager [[Connie Mack]]) (1938\u20131970), [[Veterans Stadium]] (1971\u20132003), and now at Citizens Bank Park (2004\u2013present).\n\nPartly because of the team's longevity, the Phillies were the first American sports franchise to amass over 10,000 losses.<ref name=\"mlb2007\" /> A plurality of those losses came in a 31-year period from 1918 to 1948 in which they managed only one winning season.\n\nYet, also due in part to their longevity, the Phillies are one of only nine teams to also have won over 10,000 games in their history.

They were awarded a spot in the league to replace the [[Worcester Worcesters|Worcester baseball team]], a franchise that had folded in 1882. The new team was nicknamed the \"Phillies\" from the start, and immediately compiled a .173 [[winning percentage]], which stands as the worst in franchise history. Although many sources (including the Phillies themselves) claim that Reach and Rogers bought the Brown Stockings and moved them to Philadelphia, all available evidence suggests this is not the case. Significantly, no players from Worcester<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/WOR/1882.shtml|title=1882 Worcester Ruby Legs|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|access-date=March 7, 2009}}</ref> ended up with the 1883 Quakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/PHI/1883.shtml|title=1883 Philadelphia Quakers|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|access-date=March 7, 2009}}</ref> \n\nIn [[1884 Philadelphia Quakers season|1884]], [[Harry Wright]], the former manager of baseball's first openly professional team, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], was recruited as a manager in hopes of reversing the team's fortunes.<ref name=\"TBT\">{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[1887 Philadelphia Quakers season|1887]], the team began to play at the newly constructed Philadelphia Base Ball Grounds, later renamed National League Park. The stadium would become known as the [[Baker Bowl]] in 1923.

Due to growing disagreements about the direction of the team, Reach sold his interest to Rogers in [[1899 Philadelphia Phillies season|1899]].<ref name=\"TBT\"/>\n\nWith the birth of the more lucrative [[American League]] (AL) in [[1901 Philadelphia Phillies season|1901]], the Phillies saw many of their better players defect to the upstart, including a number of players who ended up playing for their crosstown rivals, the [[History of the Philadelphia Athletics|Athletics]], owned by former Phillies minority owner [[Benjamin Shibe]]. While their former teammates would thrive (the AL's first five batting champions were former Phillies), the remaining squad fared dismally, finishing 46 games out of first place in [[1902 Philadelphia Phillies season|1902]]\u2014the first of three straight years finishing either seventh or eighth. \n\nTo add tragedy to folly, a balcony collapsed during a game at the Baker Bowl in [[1903 Philadelphia Phillies season|1903]], killing 12 and injuring hundreds. Rogers was forced to sell the Phillies to avoid being ruined by an avalanche of lawsuits.<ref name=\"TBT\"/> In [[1904 Philadelphia Phillies season|1904]], the team finished with a record of 52\u2013100, making them the first team in franchise history to have lost 100 games.\n\nThe Phillies won their first pennant in [[1915 Philadelphia Phillies season|1915]] thanks to the pitching of [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] and the batting prowess of [[Gavvy Cravath]], who set the 20th century single-season record for home runs with 24. They finished the season with a record of 90\u201362, seven games ahead of the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. The Phillies went up against the [[Boston Red Sox]] in the [[1915 World Series|World Series]], opening the series at home with a victory. The Phillies struggled against a strong Red Sox pitching lineup and surrendered the next four games, losing the series four games to one. \n\nThe team continued to dominate the National League in [[1916 Philadelphia Phillies season|1916]] but fell short of capturing a second consecutive pennant. The team finished two and a half games out of first place with a record of 91\u201362. Alexander won his second consecutive triple crown and posted 16 shutouts, tying the single-season major league record.\n\nIn [[1917 Philadelphia Phillies season|1917]], Alexander had been traded to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for pitcher [[Mike Prendergast (baseball)|Mike Prendegrast]] and catcher [[Pickles Dillhoefer]], when owner [[William Baker (baseball)|William Baker]] refused to increase his salary. Baker was known for running the Phillies very cheaply; for instance, during much of his tenure, there was only one scout in the entire organization. The Phillies finished the 1917 season in second place with a record of 87\u201365, ten games behind the [[New York Giants (baseball team)|New York Giants]].\n\n===Three decades of struggle (1918\u20131948)===\n[[File:Grand Stand Entrance of Shibe Park.jpg|alt=Street view photograph of the entrance to Shibe Park/Connie Mack Stadium, home of the Phillies from 1938 to 1970|thumb|[[Shibe Park]], renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953, was the Phillies' home field from 1938 to 1970.]]\nThe effect of the Alexander trade was immediate. In [[1918 Philadelphia Phillies season|1918]], only three years after winning the pennant, the Phillies finished sixth, 13 games under .500. It was the start of one of the longest streaks of futility in baseball history. From 1918 to 1948, the Phillies had only one winning record, which came in [[1932 Philadelphia Phillies season|1932]]. The team finished higher than sixth only twice, and were never a serious factor past June. During this stretch, they finished eighth (last place) a total of 17 times and seventh seven times, with 12 seasons in which they lost at least 100 games. This saddled the franchise with a reputation for failure that dogged it for many years. The team's primary stars during the 1920s and 1930s were outfielders [[Cy Williams]], [[Lefty O'Doul]], and [[Chuck Klein]], who won the Triple Crown in [[1933 Philadelphia Phillies season|1933]].\n\nBaker died in 1930. He left half his estate to his wife and the other half to longtime team secretary Mae Mallen. Five years earlier, Mallen had married a leather goods and shoe dealer, [[Gerald Nugent]]. With the support of Baker's widow, Nugent became team president. Baker's widow died in 1932, leaving Nugent in complete control.<ref name=\"TBT\"/> Unlike Baker, Nugent badly wanted to build a winning team, however, he did not have the financial means to do so. He was forced to trade what little talent the team had to make ends meet, and often had to use some creative financial methods to field a team at all.<ref name=\"Veeck\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sabr.org/cmsFiles/Files/Bill_Veeck_and_the_1943_sale_of_the_Phillies.pdf |title=A Baseball Myth Exploded |website=sabr.org |access-date=September 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050329183858/http://www.sabr.org/cmsFiles/Files/Bill_Veeck_and_the_1943_sale_of_the_Phillies.pdf |archive-date=March 29, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nPhiladelphia's Baker Bowl proved to be a fertile hitting ground for Phillies opponents as well, and in 1930, the team surrendered 1199 runs, a major-league record still standing today. Once considered one of the finest parks in baseball, it was not well maintained from the 1910s onward. For instance, until 1925, the Phillies used a flock of sheep to trim the grass. Fans were often showered with rust whenever one of Klein's home runs hit girders.  The entire right field grandstand collapsed in 1926, forcing the Phillies to move to the A's [[Shibe Park]] (five blocks west on Lehigh Avenue from Baker Bowl) for 1927.\nThe Phillies tried to move to Shibe Park on a permanent basis as tenants of the A's. However, Baker Bowl's owner, Charles W. Murphy, at first refused to let the Phillies out of their lease. He finally relented in 1938, and only then because the city threatened to condemn the dilapidated park. Despite the move, attendance rarely topped 3,000 a game.\n\nThe lowest point came in 1941, when the Phillies finished with a 43\u2013111 record, setting a franchise record for losses in a season. [[1942 in baseball|A year later]], they needed an advance from the league just to go to spring training. Nugent realized he did not have enough money to operate the team in 1943, and put it up for sale.\n\nAfter lumber baron [[William D. Cox]] purchased the team with a group of investors for $190,000 and a $50,000 note on March 15, 1943,<ref name=\"1943sale\">{{Cite web |url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/topic/philadelphia-phillies-team-ownership-history/ |title=Philadelphia Phillies team ownership history |website=sabr.org |access-date=September 15, 2020 |date=October 1, 2008|first=Rich| last=Westcott }}</ref> the Phillies rose out of last place for the first time in five years. As a result, the fan base and attendance at home games increased. Eventually, Cox revealed that he had been betting on the Phillies, and he was banned from baseball by [[baseball Commissioner]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] on November 23, 1943. The new owner, [[R. R. M. Carpenter|Bob Carpenter Sr.]], scion of the Delaware-based [[du Pont family|duPont family]], bought the team with his son for an estimated $400,000 that same day \u2013 November 23, 1943.<ref name=\"1943sale\"/> The Carpenters tried to polish the team's image and way of doing business. Carpenter Sr. named his son, [[Bob Carpenter, Jr.]], team president. They wanted to shed the image of failure by changing the team's nickname.\n\n====Philadelphia Blue Jays====\nBefore the 1944 season, the team held a fan contest soliciting a new team nickname.

Wilson Shaffer, the school's athletic director, criticized the Philadelphia team for adopting his university's moniker, and said that Philadelphia should use the blue jay's [[binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] instead and be known as the Philadelphia [[blue jay|Cyanocitta Cristata]]. Similarly, the university's student council, citing the Philadelphia team's long track record of failure, passed a resolution demanding \"suitable satisfaction\" for what they perceived as theft and sullying of the Blue Jays name. Carpenter, Jr., responded by criticizing Johns Hopkins' baseball record and promised to make the students proud of the Blue Jays name by having his Philadelphia baseball team win many games.<ref name=\"InqJays44\"/>\n\nThe Philadelphia team added three minor league clubs before the start of the 1946 season and named them all Blue Jays: the [[Class C (baseball)|Class C]] [[Salina Blue Jays]], [[Class C (baseball)|Class C]] [[Schenectady Blue Jays]] and [[Class D (baseball)|Class D]] [[Green Bay Bluejays|Green Bay Blue Jays]]. \n\nHowever, the new Blue Jays moniker was ultimately unpopular, and although the team in the 2000s claimed that it was quietly dropped by 1949,<ref name=\"1940s\"/> news reports at the time indicate that the nickname, which \"never caught on anyway\", was not officially dropped by the team until January 1950.<ref name=\"SpokaneJays50\"/>\n\nCoincidentally, the Phillies would play a team called the Blue Jays (who wasn't based in Philadelphia but in Toronto) in the 1993 World Series with the defending world champion Blue Jays winning in six games.\n\n(The Blue Jays moniker would be used by [[Toronto Blue Jays|Toronto]]'s MLB club when it started play in 1977.<ref name=\"1940s\"/> Coincidentally, the Blue Jays would defeat the Phillies in the [[1993 World Series]].)\n\n===Fightin\u2019 Phils (1949\u20131970)===\n{{See also|1950 World Series|Jim Bunning's perfect game|Whiz Kids (baseball)}}\n[[File:RobinRoberts.jpg|thumb|alt=A sketch portrait of Robin Roberts the Phillies' pitcher from 1948 to 1961 |[[Robin Roberts (baseball)|Robin Roberts]], Phillies' pitcher from 1948 to 1961]]\n[[File:Richie Ashburn 1953.jpg|thumb|[[Richie Ashburn]], Phillies' center fielder from 1948 to 1959]]\n[[File:1964 Philadelphia Phillies team photo.jpg|thumb|The [[1964 Philadelphia Phillies season|1964 Philadelphia Phillies]] team|alt=Team photograph of the 1964 Philadelphia Phillies]]\nLike Cox, Bob Carpenter Jr. was not afraid to spend the money it took to build a contender. He immediately started signing young players and invested even more money in the farm system, and the Phillies quickly developed a solid core of young players that included future Hall of Famers [[Richie Ashburn]] and [[Robin Roberts (baseball)|Robin Roberts]]. This coincided with the final collapse of the A's. Philadelphia had been an \"A's town\" for most of the first half of the 20th century. Even though the A's had fielded teams as bad or worse than the Phillies for most years since the 1930s, the A's continued to trounce the Phillies at the gate. However, a series of poor baseball and business decisions on the A's part allowed the Phillies to win the hearts of Philadelphia's long-suffering fans.\n\nThings started coming together for the Phillies in [[1949 Philadelphia Phillies season|1949]], when they rocketed up the standings to third place with an 81\u201373 record. Although the season had essentially been a two-team race between Brooklyn and St. Louis, it was still the Phillies' first appearance in the [[First division (baseball)|first division]] in 31 years. It was also a fitting tribute to Bob Carpenter Sr., who had died in June and left Bob Jr. in full control of the team.\n\nThe [[1950 Philadelphia Phillies season|1950]] Phillies led the National League standings for most of the season and were dubbed the \"[[Whiz Kids (baseball)|Whiz Kids]]\". In the final months of the season, a tailspin (triggered by the loss of starting pitcher [[Curt Simmons]] to National Guard service) caused the team to lose the next eight of ten games. On the last day of the season, the Phillies hung on to a one-game lead when [[Dick Sisler]]\u2019s dramatic tenth inning home run against the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] clinched the Phillies' first pennant in 35 years. In the [[1950 World Series|World Series]], exhausted from their late-season plunge and victims of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the [[New York Yankees]] in four straight games. Nonetheless, this appearance cemented the Phillies' status as the city's favorite team.\n\nIn contrast, the Philadelphia Athletics finished last in 1950, and longtime manager [[Connie Mack]] retired. The team struggled for four more years with only one winning season before abandoning Philadelphia under the Johnson brothers, who bought out Mack. They began to play in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in 1955.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fleming |first=Frank |title=Philadelphia Athletics |date=April 9, 2006 |url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/al/philadelphia/phillya_s.html |website=sportsecyclopedia.com|access-date=June 4, 2008}}</ref> As part of the deal selling that team to the Johnson brothers, the Phillies bought Shibe Park, where both teams had played since 1938.<ref name=\"Phillies1950\">{{cite web |title=Phillies Timeline: 1950s |work=History Highlights |publisher=Philadelphia Phillies |url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/history/timeline07.jsp |access-date=June 4, 2008 |archive-date=September 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910142851/http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/history/timeline07.jsp |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many thought that the \"Whiz Kids\", with a young core of talented players, would be a force in the league for years to come.<ref name=\"robertsbd\">{{cite journal| last=Hochman| first=Stan| date=July 1972| title=Robin Roberts Remembers the 'Whiz Kids'| journal=[[Baseball Digest]]| publisher=Lakeside Publishing Company| volume=31| issue=7| pages=35\u201338| issn=0005-609X| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zIDAAAAMBAJ&q=whiz+kids+baseball&pg=PA35}}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"whitey\">{{cite book |last=Zimniuch| first=Fran| title=Richie Ashburn Remembered| publisher=[[Sports Publishing]] LLC| year=2005| page=23| chapter=Big Leagues, Here I Come| isbn=1-58261-897-6| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3d7TouZUHIwC&q=whiz+kids+baseball&pg=PA23| access-date=October 29, 2009}}</ref> However, the team finished with a 73\u201381 record in [[1951 Philadelphia Phillies season|1951]] and finished nine and a half games out of first place in [[1952 Philadelphia Phillies season|1952]], with an 87\u201367 record. The Phillies managed to end up in third place in [[1953 Philadelphia Phillies season|1953]] with an 83\u201371 record, however, they would fail to break .500 from 1954 to 1957.\n\nIt became apparent that the flash and determination of the Whiz Kids would not return when the team finished last place in the National League from 1958 to 1961. Manager [[Eddie Sawyer]] abruptly quit the team after the season opener in [[1960 Philadelphia Phillies season|1960]], and was replaced by [[Gene Mauch]].\n\nThe team's competitive futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: in [[1961 Philadelphia Phillies season|1961]], the Phillies lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in the majors since 1900. Things started to turn around for the team in [[1962 Philadelphia Phillies season|1962]], when the team finished above .500 for the first time in five years. Gene Mauch was named National League Manager of the Year that season and won it again in 1964. The team improved in [[1963 Philadelphia Phillies season|1963]], when the team finished the season with an 87\u201375 record. There was confidence that the team would soon become contenders for a return to the World Series. Though Ashburn and Roberts were gone, the [[1964 Philadelphia Phillies season|1964]] Phillies still had younger pitchers [[Art Mahaffey]], [[Chris Short]], and rookie [[Ray Culp]]; veterans [[Jim Bunning]] and [[screwball]]er [[Jack Baldschun]]; and fan favorites [[Cookie Rojas]], [[Johnny Callison]], and [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|NL Rookie of the Year]] [[Dick Allen]]. The team was 90\u201360 on September 20, good enough for a lead of 6.5 games in the pennant race with 12 games to play. However, the Phillies lost 10 games in a row and finished one game out of first, losing the pennant to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. The \"Phold of '64\" is frequently mentioned as the worst collapse in sports history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phillies Timeline: 1960s |work=History Highlights |publisher=Philadelphia Phillies |url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/history/timeline08.jsp |access-date=June 5, 2008 |archive-date=May 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514064401/http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/history/timeline08.jsp |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOne highlight of the 1964 season occurred on [[Father's Day]], when Jim Bunning pitched a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] against the [[New York Mets]], the first in Phillies' history.<ref>{{cite web| last1=McCoy| first1=Hal| title=Father's Day to remember: Bunning's perfect game of '64| url= http://www.foxsports.com/ohio/story/50th-anniversary-jim-bunning-father-s-day-perfect-game-philadelphia-phillies-new-york-mets-061314| website=[[Fox Sports]]| publisher=Fox News| access-date=September 4, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818123707/http://www.foxsports.com/ohio/story/50th-anniversary-jim-bunning-father-s-day-perfect-game-philadelphia-phillies-new-york-mets-061314| archive-date=August 18, 2015| date=June 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor the rest of the decade, the team finished no higher than fourth place in the NL standings which came during the [[1966 Philadelphia Phillies season|1966 season]]. In the [[1969 Philadelphia Phillies season|1969 season]], the Phillies finished fifth in the newly created [[NL East Division]], with a record of 63\u201399.\n\nBy the late 1950s, Carpenter decided the Phillies needed a new home. He never wanted to buy Connie Mack Stadium in the first place, and was now convinced there was no way he could make money playing there. He sold the park to [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' owner [[Jerry Wolman]] in 1964, taking a $1&nbsp;million loss on his purchase of just 10 years earlier. The stadium was deteriorating and there was inadequate parking. Attendance began to drop by 1967 and the team started to plan for a new stadium. \n\nThe Phillies remained at Connie Mack Stadium until 1970. In the last game played there, the Phillies avoided last place by beating the Expos 2\u20131. When the game was finished several fans in attendance began to remove items from the ballpark, such as chairs, outfield panels and baseball equipment from the dugouts.\n\n===Glory days (1971\u20131984)===\n{{See also|1980 World Series|1983 World Series|Hot Pants Patrol}}\n[[File:Mike Schmidt HR vs. Cincinnati Reds at Veterans Stadium July 20, 1987.jpg|thumb|[[Veterans Stadium]], home of the Phillies from 1971 to 2003|alt=Photograph of Veterans Stadium the Phillies' home from 1971 to 2003]]\n[[File:Mike Schmidt - Philadelphia Phillies - 1983.jpg|alt=Portrait of Phillies' third baseman Mike Schmidt looking at the camera and holding a bat across his chest|thumb|[[Mike Schmidt]], Phillies' third baseman from 1972 to 1989 and a [[1995 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1995]] [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] inductee]]\n[[File:Steve Carlton - Philadelphia Phillies - 1983.jpg|thumb|[[Steve Carlton]], Phillies' pitcher from 1972 to 1986 and a [[1994 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1994 Hall of Fame]] inductee|182x182px]]\nThe Phillies opened the new [[Veterans Stadium]] in [[1971 Philadelphia Phillies season|1971]]. The team wore new maroon uniforms to accentuate the change. The stadium was built in [[South Philadelphia]], making it the first time the team was not located in [[North Philadelphia]]. The new stadium, along with nearby [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] and the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]], established the [[South Philadelphia Sports Complex]]. \n\nPitcher [[Rick Wise]] hurled a no-hitter and in the same game hit two home runs against the Cincinnati Reds in 1971. That same season, [[Harry Kalas]] joined the Phillies broadcasting team. \n\nIn [[1972 Philadelphia Phillies season|1972]], the Phillies were the worst team in baseball, but newly acquired [[Steve Carlton]] won nearly half their games (27 of 59 team wins) and was awarded his first NL [[Cy Young Award]] and won it again in 1977. Bob Carpenter Jr. retired in 1972 and passed the team ownership to his son [[Ruly Carpenter|Ruly]]. \n\nThe Phillies achieved some success in the mid-1970s. With players such as Carlton, third baseman [[Mike Schmidt]], shortstop [[Larry Bowa]], catcher Bob Boone, and outfielder [[Greg Luzinski]], the Phillies won three straight division titles (1976\u201378). However, they fell short in the [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]], against the Reds in [[1976 National League Championship Series|1976]] and the Dodgers in [[1977 National League Championship Series|1977]] and [[1978 National League Championship Series|1978]]. In 1979, the Phillies acquired [[Pete Rose]], the spark that would put them over the top.\n\n====1980 World Series champions====\n{{main|1980 World Series}}\nThe Phillies won the National League East in 1980, but to win the league championship, they had to defeat the [[Houston Astros]].

In five games, they were defeated in the first-ever National League Division Series by the [[Montreal Expos]]. Mike Schmidt won his second consecutive NL Most Valuable Player award that year. In 1982, the team finished three games behind the St. Louis Cardinals in the East Division, narrowly missing the playoffs. Carlton captured his fourth career NL Cy Young Award that year with 23 wins. \n\nFor the 1983 season, the Phillies returned to the playoffs and beat the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. They won this series in four games to capture their fourth NL pennant; however, they lost to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in the World Series in five games. [[John Denny]] was named the 1983 NL Cy Young Award winner. Because of the numerous veterans on the 1983 team, ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' sportswriter Stan Hochman gave them the nickname, the \"Wheeze Kids\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/20101221_Stan_Hochman__One_nickname_for_Phillies__aces_rises_to_top.html|title=One nickname for Phillies' aces rises to top|author=Stan Hochman|date=December 21, 2010|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|access-date=December 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1984 Philadelphia Phillies season|1984]], the team finished fourth in the NL East with a record of 81\u201381.

They went on to finish second in the division with a record of 86\u201375. Mike Schmidt led the National League in home runs and runs batted in that year and also won his third National League Most Valuable Player award, sixth Silver Slugger award and tenth Gold Glove.\n\nIn [[1987 Philadelphia Phillies season|1987]], closer [[Steve Bedrosian]] was named the NL Cy Young Award winner. \n\nInjuries caused Mike Schmidt to miss most of the [[1988 Philadelphia Phillies season|1988 season]] and he retired from baseball after playing in only 42 games in [[1989 Philadelphia Phillies season|1989]], thus, the last member of the 1980 championship team was gone.\n\nIn [[1990 Philadelphia Phillies season|1990]], [[Terry Mulholland]] lost a perfect game in the seventh inning when a San Francisco Giants' batter reached base on a throwing error. The next batter grounded into a double play. Thus, Mulholland faced the perfect-game maximum of 27 batters, but did not qualify for a perfect game. He was credited, however, with a no-hitter.<ref>See: [[Perfect game (baseball)|Perfect game]].</ref> \n\nDuring this time, the Phillies often struggled to attract more than 25,000 people to Veterans Stadium, the biggest in the National League at the time (at over 62,000 seats).

The team was dubbed \"Macho Row\" for their shaggy, unkempt, and dirty look. Their character endeared them to fans, and attendance reached a record high the following season. \n\nThe team powered their way to a 97\u201365 record and an NL East division title, all thanks to a big April in which the Phillies went 17\u20135. The Phillies' major contributors on offense were Dykstra, Kruk, [[Kevin Stocker]] (a rookie who led the team in batting average, hitting .324), and [[Jim Eisenreich]], all of whom hit over .300 for the season. Their pitching staff was led by 16-game winners Curt Schilling and [[Tommy Greene]].

A dark burgundy was adopted as the main team color, with a classic pinstripe style for home uniforms. Blue was almost entirely dropped as part of the team's official color scheme, except in one area; a pale blue (as opposed to traditional grey) was used as the base-color for away game uniforms from 1972 to 1988. Yet the most important aspect of the 1970 uniform change was the adoption of one of the more distinctive logos in sports; a Phillies \"P\" that, thanks to its unique shape and \"baseball stitched\" center swirl, remained instantly recognizable and admired, long after its regular use had ended. It was while wearing this uniform style and color motif that the club achieved its most enduring success, including a World Series title in 1980 and another World Series appearance in 1983.<ref name=\"Unis1\" /> Its continued popularity with fans is still evident. Even today, Phillies' home games can contain many fans sporting caps, shirts or jackets emblazoned with the iconic \"P\" and burgundy color scheme. The current team has worn the burgundy and powder blue throwbacks whenever their opponents are wearing throwback uniforms from that era.

2017. In 2018, the exhibit was moved to a new plaza between the left-field scoreboard and the left-field entrance of the stadium.\n\nThe Phillies Wall of Fame was started in 1978 as the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame. Until 2004, the Phillies inducted one former Phillie and one former member of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] per year. Since 2004, they have only inducted one Phillie annually (with the exception of 2022 and 2023, when they inducted two and three Phillies, respectively). Eligible players must be retired and must have played at least four years with the Phillies. The Phillies' inductees to the Wall of Fame are listed below (note that there was no inductee for the 2017 season, as Pete Rose was planned to be inducted, but was not due to controversial allegations):[[File:ChuckKleinbaseballcard.jpg|thumb|[[Chuck Klein]], 1980 Wall of Fame inductee]]\n[[File:Centennial Team.jpg|thumb|Phillies Centennial Team, 1983 Wall of Fame inductees|alt=A dark bronze plaque listing the names and positions of members of the Centennial team in gold lettering]]\n[[File:Mike Schmidt plaque.jpg|thumb|alt=Mike Schmidt's bronze 1990 Wall of Fame plaque|[[Mike Schmidt]], 1990 Wall of Fame inductee]]\n[[File:Dick Allen.jpg|thumb|[[Dick Allen]], 1993 Wall of Fame inductee]]\n[[File:Tug McGraw Phillies.JPG|thumb|[[Tug McGraw]], 1998 Wall of Fame inductee]]\n[[File:Garry Maddox 1974.jpg|thumb|[[Garry Maddox]], 2001 Wall of Fame inductee]]\n[[File:Baseball pat burrell 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Pat Burrell]], 2015 Wall of Fame inductee]]\n[[File:Jim Thome on June 9, 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Jim Thome]], 2016 Wall of Fame inductee]]\n[[File:Bobby Abreu in 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Bobby Abreu]], 2019 Wall of Fame inductee]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#ffffbb;\" | {{\u2020|alt=Hall of Fame}} \n| Member of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#cfc;\"|  '''Bold''' \n|Recipient of the Hall of Fame's [[Ford C.
