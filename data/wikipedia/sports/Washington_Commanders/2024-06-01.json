The usage of the term ''[[redskin]]'' was [[Washington Redskins name controversy|controversial]] for decades.

From [[1936 Boston Redskins season|1936]] to [[1945 Washington Redskins season|1945]], the team went to the [[NFL Championship]] six times, winning two of them. The second period lasted from [[1982 Washington Redskins season|1982]] to [[1991 Washington Redskins season|1991]] under owner [[Jack Kent Cooke]], general managers [[Bobby Beathard]] and [[Charley Casserly]], and head coach [[Joe Gibbs]]. From 1946 to 1970, Washington posted just four winning seasons and never reached the postseason. They went without a single winning season from 1956 to 1968, a span that included their worst regular-season record: 1\u201312\u20131 in [[1961 Washington Redskins season|1961]].

In 1935, Joe F.

Nothing could have been more erroneous. Boston finished the most forbidding ground for professional football of any large city in the country.

In the first quarter, the Redskins had the ball at their own 5-yard line. Dropping back into the [[end zone]], [[quarterback]] Baugh threw to an open receiver, but the ball hit the goal post and bounced back to the ground in the end zone. Under the rules at the time, this was ruled as a safety and thus gave the Rams a 2\u20130 lead. Marshall was so upset at the outcome that he became a major force in passing a major rule change after the season, in which a forward pass that struck the goalpost was automatically ruled incomplete.

In that game, the Redskins broke the record for fewest offensive yards (120) gained in a playoff victory, with one of their two touchdowns being from a defensive run after a fumble recovery.

To close the game, Todd Collins threw two interceptions, each returned for a touchdown, and the Redskins fell 35\u201314.\n\nAfter Joe Gibbs announced his retirement following the 2007 season, [[Jim Zorn]] was hired as head coach and brought in a [[West Coast Offense]]. The [[2008 Washington Redskins season|2008 season]] started well, as the Redskins started the season 6\u20132. Furthermore, Redskins RB [[Clinton Portis]] led the NFL in rushing yards. However, things turned for the worse in early November, when they were routed 23\u20136 by the [[2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] and Portis' injuries finally caught up to him. The Redskins continued to struggle, falling all the way to 7\u20137, with their only win during that six-week period being a 3-point victory of the then-2\u20138 [[2008 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]]. The Redskins managed to upset the [[2008 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] in Week 16, but were eliminated from playoff contention. The team's fortunes continued to slide in [[2009 Washington Redskins season|2009]], as they finished 4\u201312. Zorn was fired and replaced by [[Mike Shanahan]] after the season.\n\nOn April 4, the Redskins acquired [[Donovan McNabb]] in a trade from the rival [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. However, the Redskins struggled to a 6\u201310 finish, once again 4th place in the division. The McNabb era came to an abrupt end when he was traded to Minnesota in August 2011. The troublesome {{Clarify|date=March 2023|reason=This is a [[sentence fragment]].}} After cutting the injury-rattled [[Clinton Portis]], the Redskins had no important offensive players left except for Santana Moss. Mike Shanahan surprised most observers by his decision to name [[John Beck (gridiron football)|John Beck]], an obscure free-agent quarterback, as the starter. However, Shanahan suddenly reversed direction by naming veteran backup [[Rex Grossman]] to the starting position. In Week 1, Grossman threw for 305 yards and two touchdown passes as the Redskins crushed the Giants 28\u201314, ending a six-game losing streak against that team. The Washington Redskins started the season 2\u20130, but then struggled to a 5\u201311 finish, however, they managed to win both meetings over the eventual [[Super Bowl XLVI|Super Bowl]] champion [[2011 New York Giants season|New York Giants]].\n\nIn [[2012 Washington Redskins season|2012]], the Redskins traded several high draft picks to the [[St. Louis Rams]] in order to take Baylor quarterback [[Robert Griffin III]] second overall in the [[2012 NFL Draft]]. Although the need for a franchise quarterback was obvious, many journalists had doubts about the value of giving up a lot for a single player. In the opening game of the season, Griffin threw for 320 yards and two touchdown passes in a 40\u201332 victory over the [[2012 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] to give the team its highest-scoring game since 2005. The Redskins struggled to a 3\u20136 start, but in Week 11, the Redskins would host the struggling Philadelphia Eagles. Griffin would have one of the best games of his career to date, as the Redskins won 31\u20136 with long touchdowns to Santana Moss and Aldrick Robinson. The Redskins would win their next 6 games after that, including the crucial final game of the season against the Cowboys, which would clinch the division for and send the Redskins to the playoffs. The Redskins hosted the [[2012 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in the Wild Card round but lost 24\u201314.\n\nHopes were high for a repeat division title in [[2013 Washington Redskins season|2013]].

Gold face masks were introduced in 1978 and remain as such to this day; previous to that they were grey. Throughout most of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, Washington was just one of three other teams that primarily wore their white jerseys at home (the others being the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Miami Dolphins]]). The tradition of wearing white jerseys over burgundy pants at home, which is considered the \"classic\" look, was started by [[Joe Gibbs]] when he took over as coach in 1981. Gibbs was an assistant for the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] in 1979 and 1980 when the team wore white at home under head coach [[Don Coryell]].\n\nTheir burgundy jerseys were primarily used only when the opposing team decided to wear white at home, which came mostly against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and was normally worn over white pants. It was worn on the road against other teams that prefer to wear white at home for games occurring early in the season. From 1981 through 2000, Washington wore their white jerseys over burgundy pants at home almost exclusively. In 1994, as part of a league-wide celebration of the NFL's 75th anniversary, during certain games, the team wore special uniforms which emulated the uniforms worn by the team in its inaugural season in Washington in 1937. Both worn over gold pants, the burgundy jerseys featured gold numbers bordered in white and the white jerseys featured burgundy numbers bordered in gold. The most distinctive feature of both colors of the jersey was the patches worn on both sleeves, which were a reproduction of the patches worn on the full-length sleeves of the 1937 jerseys. Worn with these uniforms was a plain burgundy helmet with a gold facemask.\n\nIn 2001, the team wore burgundy for all home games in the preseason and regular season per a decision by Marty Schottenheimer, their coach for that year. In 2002, the team celebrated the passing of 70 years since its creation as the Boston Braves in 1932 and wore a special home uniform, a burgundy jersey over gold pants, which roughly resembled the home uniforms used from 1969 to 1978. The helmets used with this special home uniform during that year were a reproduction of the helmets used by the team from 1965 to 1969, though they wore white at home in Week 1 against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] and again in Week 17, the latter forcing the Cowboys to use their blue jerseys.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Redskins Adopt 'Retro' Look; 70 Greatest Redskins to be Selected |date=February 6, 2002 |url=http://www.redskins.com/story.asp?ContentID=10789 |access-date=July 23, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021013201106/http://www.redskins.com/story.asp?ContentID=10789 |archive-date=October 13, 2002 |website=Redskins.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Washington Redskins New Uniforms |url=https://www.espn.com/page2/s/newlook/redskins/uniforms.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519170507/http://espn.go.com/page2/s/newlook/redskins/uniforms.html |archive-date=May 19, 2010 |access-date=February 1, 2022 |website=ESPN}}</ref> This special home uniform was also worn during one game in 2003. In 2004, when Gibbs became the coach of the team once again, the team switched back to wearing white jerseys at home; in Gibbs's 16 years as head coach, the team never wore burgundy jerseys at home, even wearing a white throwback jersey in 2007.\n\nTheir white jerseys have provided three basic color combinations. The last combination consists of both white jerseys and pants. That particular combination surfaced in the first game of the 2003 season when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier, during a nationally televised game against the [[New York Jets]], which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that they had never seen that particular combination before. The Redskins won six straight games, including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing that combination. In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion [[2005 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], Washington wore the all-white uniforms in hopes that they could keep their streak going; however, they lost 20\u201310. The white jersey over burgundy pants look reappeared in a home game against the [[Carolina Panthers]] later in 2006.\n\nIn celebration of the franchise's 75th anniversary, Washington wore a one-time [[throwback uniform]] for a home game against the [[New York Giants]], based on their away uniform from 1970 to 1971. Players wore a white jersey with three burgundy and two gold stripes on each sleeve and the 75th-anniversary logo on the left chest. The pants were gold, with one white stripe bordered by a burgundy stripe on each side, running down each side. The helmet was gold-colored with a burgundy \"R\" logo. The helmet and uniform styles were the same as the ones the franchise used during the 1970\u201371 seasons. [[Vince Lombardi]], who coached Washington in 1969 before dying during the 1970 preseason, was the inspiration behind the helmet. Lombardi pushed for the logo, which sat inside a white circle enclosed within a burgundy circle border, with Native American feathers hanging down from the side because of its similarity to the \"G\" on the helmets worn by the [[Green Bay Packers]], who he had coached during most of the 1960s.\n\nIn a 2008 ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], Washington wore a [[monochrome dress|monochrome]] look by wearing burgundy jerseys over burgundy pants.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 3, 2008 |title=Roethlisberger leaves at halftime, Leftwich leads Steelers past Skins |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=281103028 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107195557/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=281103028 |archive-date=January 7, 2016 |access-date=November 22, 2018 |website=ESPN}}</ref> This combination made two further appearances the following season against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[New York Giants]].
