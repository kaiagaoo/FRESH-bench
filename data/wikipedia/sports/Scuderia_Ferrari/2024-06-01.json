The team is also known by the nickname \"'''The Prancing Horse'''\" ({{lang-it|il Cavallino Rampante}} or simply {{lang|it|il Cavallino}}), in reference to their logo. It is the oldest surviving and [[List of Formula One Grand Prix winners (constructors)|most successful Formula One team]], having competed in every world championship since {{f1|1950}}.\n\nThe team was founded by [[Enzo Ferrari]], initially to race cars produced by [[Alfa Romeo]]. By 1947, Ferrari had begun building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside Formula One are winning the [[World Sportscar Championship]], [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], [[24 Hours of Spa]], [[24 Hours of Daytona]], [[12 Hours of Sebring]], [[Bathurst 12 Hour]], races for [[Grand tourer]] cars, and racing on road courses of the [[Targa Florio]], the [[Mille Miglia]], and the [[Carrera Panamericana]]. The team is also known for its passionate support base, known as the ''[[Tifosi#Formula One|tifosi]]''. The [[Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]] is regarded as the team's home race.\n\nAs a constructor in Formula One, Ferrari has a record 16 [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championships]]. Their most recent Constructors' Championship was won in {{f1|2008}}. The team also holds the record for the most [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championships]] with 15, won by nine different drivers including [[Alberto Ascari]], [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Mike Hawthorn]], [[Phil Hill]], [[John Surtees]], [[Niki Lauda]], [[Jody Scheckter]], [[Michael Schumacher]], and [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]]. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen's title in {{f1|2007}} is the most recent for the team. The [[2020 Tuscan Grand Prix]] marked Ferrari's 1000th Grand Prix in Formula One.\n\nSchumacher is the team's most successful driver. Joining the team in {{f1|1996}} and driving for them until his first retirement in {{f1|2006}}, he won five consecutive drivers' titles and 72 Grands Prix for the team. His titles came consecutively between {{f1|2000}} and {{f1|2004}}, and the team won consecutive constructors' titles between {{f1|1999}} and 2004, marking the era as the most successful period in the team's history. The team's drivers for the {{f1|2024}} season are [[Charles Leclerc]] and [[Carlos Sainz Jr.]] The latter will be replaced by [[Lewis Hamilton]] in {{f1|2025}}.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Alfa-Romeo-2900-Scuderia-Ferrari-maroon-fa-lr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfa Romeo 8C]] 2900 Scuderia Ferrari]]\nScuderia Ferrari was founded by [[Enzo Ferrari]] in 1929 to enter amateur drivers in various races.<ref name=\"f1i.com\">F1i.com: [http://f1i.com/teams/ferrari Ferrari | F1i.com], accessdate: 10. February 2019</ref> Ferrari himself had raced in Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali and [[Alfa Romeo]] cars before that date. The idea came about on the night of 16 November at a dinner in [[Bologna]], where Ferrari solicited financial help from textile heirs Augusto and Alfredo Caniato and wealthy amateur racer Mario Tadini. He then gathered a team which at its peak included over forty drivers, most of whom raced in various [[Alfa Romeo 8C]] cars; Ferrari himself continued racing, with moderate success, until the birth of his first son [[Alfredo Ferrari|Dino]] in 1932. The prancing horse blazon first appeared at the 1932 [[Spa 24 Hours]] in Belgium on a two-car team of [[Alfa Romeo 8C]] 2300 Spiders, which finished first and second.\n\nIn 1933, Alfa Romeo experienced economic difficulties and withdrew its team from racing. From then, the Scuderia Ferrari became the acting racing team of Alfa Romeo when the factory released to the Scuderia the up to date [[Monoposto]] Tipo B racers. In 1935, Enzo Ferrari and Luigi Bazzi built the [[Alfa Romeo Bimotore]], the first car to wear a Ferrari badge on the radiator cowl. Ferrari managed numerous established drivers (notably [[Tazio Nuvolari]], [[Giuseppe Campari]], [[Achille Varzi]], and [[Louis Chiron]]) and several talented rookies (Mario Tadini, [[Guy Moll]], [[Carlo Maria Pintacuda]], and [[Antonio Brivio]]) from his headquarters in Viale Trento e Trieste, [[Modena, Italy]], until 1938, at which point Alfa Romeo made him the manager of the factory racing division, [[Alfa Corse]]. Alfa Romeo had bought the shares of the Scuderia Ferrari in 1937 and transferred, from 1 January 1938,<ref name=\"Henry12\">{{cite book| last = Henry| first = Alan| author-link = Alan Henry| title = Ferrari&nbsp;\u2013 The Grand Prix Cars| publisher=Hazleton| page = 12| edition = 2nd| year = 1989}}</ref> the official racing activity to [[Alfa Corse]] whose new buildings were being erected next to the Alfa factory at [[Portello, Milan]]. The Viale Trento e Trieste facilities remained active to assist the racing customers.\n\n[[File:Piloti Alfa Romeo 2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Enzo Ferrari]] (first from left), [[Tazio Nuvolari]] (fourth), and [[Achille Varzi]] (sixth) with [[Alfa Romeo]] managing director Prospero Gianferrari (third) at Colle Maddalena]]\nEnzo Ferrari disagreed with this policy change and was dismissed by Alfa in 1939. In October 1939, Enzo Ferrari left Alfa when the racing activity stopped and founded Auto Avio Costruzioni Ferrari, which also manufactured machine tools. The agreement with Alfa included the condition that he would not use the Ferrari name on cars for four years. In the winter of 1939\u20131940, Ferrari started work on a racecar of his own, the [[Auto Avio Costruzioni 815|Tipo 815]] (eight cylinders, 1.5&nbsp;L displacement).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kW5eCAAAQBAJ&q=Ferrari+working+tipo+815+1939&pg=PT16|title=Collection Editions: Ferrari In Formula One|last=Buckland|first=Damien|date=4 February 2015|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=9781326174880}}</ref> The 815s, designed by [[Alberto Massimino]], were thus the first true Ferrari cars. After [[Alberto Ascari]] and the Marchese Lotario Rangoni Machiavelli di Modena drove them in the 1940 [[Mille Miglia]], [[World War II]] put a temporary end to racing and the 815s saw no more competition. Ferrari continued to manufacture machine tools (specifically oleodynamic grinding machines). In 1943, he moved his headquarters to [[Maranello]], where it was bombed in November 1944 and February 1945.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ferrari marks its first seven decades throughout 2017 |url=https://www.hemmings.com/stories/2017/04/11/ferrari-marks-its-first-seven-decades-throughout-2017 |access-date=11 August 2023 |work=hemmings.com |date=11 April 2017 |quote=... was twice targeted by Allied bombing raids, in 1944 and 1945.}} \n</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aversa |first1=Paolo |last2=Schreiter |first2=Katrin |last3=Guerrini |first3=Filippo |title=The Birth of a Business Icon through Cultural Branding: Ferrari and the Prancing Horse, 1923\u20131947 |journal=Enterprise & Society |date= 26 July 2021 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=28\u201358 |doi=10.1017/eso.2021.22 |url=https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/25916/<!--https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b97b5f4ec81eb8285d7eadc294442e6c00ee8c0 https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Birth-of-a-Business-Icon-through-Cultural-and-Aversa-Schreiter/9b97b5f4ec81eb8285d7eadc294442e6c00ee8c0--> |access-date=11 August 2023 |publisher=Business History Conference | s2cid = 237737650  |issn=1467-2235 | eissn = 1467-2235 |quote=... the Ferrari plants were bombed twice, first in November 1944 and then in February 1945.}} [[City Research Online]]. <!--See also:\n* [https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/25916/3/Aversa_Schreiter_Guerrini_2021_EandS.pdf PDF] {{free access}}\n* Aversa, Paolo, Katrin Schreiter, and Filippo Guerrini. \"[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/885717/summary The Birth of a Business Icon through Cultural Branding: Ferrari and the Prancing Horse, 1923\u20131947.]\" Enterprise & Society 24, no. 1 (2023): 28-58.

Meanwhile, Ferrari rebuilt his works in Maranello and constructed the 12-cylinder, 1.5&nbsp;L [[Ferrari Tipo 125|Tipo 125]], which competed at several non-championship Grands Prix. The car made its debut at the [[1948 Italian Grand Prix]] with [[Raymond Sommer]] and achieved its first win at the minor Circuito di Garda with [[Giuseppe Farina]]. After the four-year condition expired, the road car company was called Ferrari [[S.p.A.]], while the name SEFAC (Societ\u00e0 Esercizio Fabbriche Automobili e Corse) was used for the racing department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/ferrari-s-p-a-history/|title=Ferrari S.p.A.

The team owns and operates a test track on the same site, the [[Fiorano Circuit]] built in 1972, which is used for testing road and race cars.\n\n===Identity===\nThe team is named after its founder [[Enzo Ferrari]]. ''Scuderia'' is Italian for a stable reserved for racing horses,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Scuderia \u2212 Dizionario italiano-inglese WordReference |url=https://www.wordreference.com/iten/scuderia |access-date=11 February 2024 |website=Wordreference.com}}</ref> and is also commonly applied to Italian motor racing teams. The prancing horse was the symbol used on Italian [[World War I]] ace [[Francesco Baracca]]'s fighter plane. It became the logo of Ferrari after the fallen ace's parents, close acquaintances of Enzo Ferrari, suggested that Ferrari use the symbol as the logo of the ''Scuderia'', telling him it would \"bring him good luck\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.museobaracca.it/The-prancing-horse|title=The prancing horse|publisher=Museo Francesco Baracca|access-date=30 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Formula One==\n{{main|Grand Prix racing history of Scuderia Ferrari}}\nSince its debut in 1950, Ferrari has become a byword for [[Formula One]].

When regulations changed in 2014, Cosworth decided not to make the new V6 turbo engines. Marussia, Cosworth's only team at the time, signed a multi-year deal with Ferrari, beginning in 2014. For the [[2024 Formula One World Championship|2024 season]], Ferrari supplies the [[Haas F1 Team]] and [[Sauber Motorsport]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/115679|title=Haas F1 Team seals multi-year Ferrari engine deal from 2016|work=[[Autosport]]|date=3 September 2014|access-date=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with governing body===\nFerrari did not enter the first-ever race of the championship, the [[1950 British Grand Prix]], due to a dispute with the organisers over \"start money\". In the 1960s, Ferrari withdrew from several races in strike actions. In 1987, Ferrari considered abandoning Formula One for the American IndyCar series. This threat was used as a bargaining tool with the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile ]] (FIA), and Enzo Ferrari offered to cancel the IndyCar Project and commit to Formula One on the condition that the technical regulations were not changed to exclude V12 engines. The FIA agreed to this, and the IndyCar project was shelved, although a car, the [[Ferrari 637]], had already been constructed. In 2009, it had emerged that Ferrari had an FIA-sanctioned veto on the technical regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/75327|title=Ferrari pushing to stay under own terms|last=Noble|first=Jonathan|date=15 May 2009|work=Autosport}}</ref>\n\n===Team orders controversies===\nTeam orders have proven controversial at several points in Ferrari's history. At the [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix]], the two Ferraris were leading with [[Gilles Villeneuve]] ahead of [[Didier Pironi]]. The team showed the slow sign to its drivers, and, as per a pre-race agreement, the driver leading at that point was expected to take the win of the Grand Prix. Villeneuve slowed and expected that Pironi would follow; the latter did not and instead passed Villeneuve. Villeneuve was angered by what he saw as a betrayal by his teammate and, at one point, had even refused to go onto the podium.<ref>{{cite web |last=Williamson |first=Martin |date=25 April 1982 |title=Pironi leaves Villeneuve fuming |url=http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/13877.html |access-date=11 February 2024 |work=ESPN UK}}</ref> This feud is often considered to have been a contributory factor to his fatal accident in qualifying at the next race, the [[1982 Belgian Grand Prix]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cooper |first=Adam |date=8 May 2022 |title=F1: The untold Gilles Villeneuve story from inside Ferrari |url=https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/gilles-villeneuve-story-inside-ferrari/10301215/ |access-date=11 February 2024 |website=Motorsport.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cooper |first=Adam |date=8 May 2021 |title=The inside story of Villeneuve's final F1 weekend |url=https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/gilles-villeneuve-ferrari-death-zolder/4789835/ |access-date=11 February 2024 |website=Motorsport.com}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2002 Austrian Grand Prix]], after having started from pole position and leading the first 70 laps, [[Rubens Barrichello]] was instructed to let Ferrari teammate [[Michael Schumacher]] pass him, a move that proved to be unpopular among many Formula One fans and the [[FIA]], the sport's governing body.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/may/12/formulaone.theobserver|title=Barrichello gets pole in Austria|work=The Guardian|date=12 May 2002|access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/05/13/austria.ferrari/index.html|title=F1 summons Schumacher, Barrichello |date=13 May 2002|publisher=CNN|access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref> Following this incident and others in which team orders were used, such as [[McLaren]]'s use of them at the [[1997 European Grand Prix]] and at the [[1998 Australian Grand Prix]], and [[Jordan Grand Prix]]'s at the [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix]], team orders in Formula One were officially banned ahead of the {{F1|2003}} season.<ref>{{Cite web |date=26 September 2003 |title=F1 teams are given orders warning |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2003/SPORT/09/25/motor.mosley/ |access-date=11 February 2024 |website=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/79515-spa-francorchamps-grand-prix-1998-the-greatest-f1-race-ever|title=Spa Francorchamps Grand Prix 1998: The Greatest F1 Race Ever?|last=O'Shea|first=Mary|date=9 November 2009|website=Bleacher Report|access-date=11 February 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mclaren.com/racing/team/11-pitstops-that-changed-the-face-of-a-race/|title=McLaren Formula 1 \u2013 12 pitstops that changed the face of a race |publisher=McLaren|date=21 April 2020|access-date=11 February 2024}}</ref>\n\nOn lap 49 of the [[2010 German Grand Prix]], [[Fernando Alonso]] went past [[Felipe Massa]] for the race lead, after Ferrari had informed Massa that Alonso was \"faster than him\".

Until the 1980s, the only other companies whose logos appeared on Ferrari's Formula One cars were technical partners, such as [[Magneti Marelli]], [[Brembo]], and [[Agip]]. At the end of the {{F1|1996}} season, [[Philip Morris International]] through its brand [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] withdrew its sponsorship agreement with [[McLaren]] after 22 years (since the {{F1|1974}} season) to become the title sponsor of Ferrari, resulting to the change of the official team's name to Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro from the beginning of the {{F1|1997}} season until the [[2011 European Grand Prix]]. Marlboro had already been Ferrari's minor sponsor since the {{F1|1984}} season and increased to the team's major sponsorship in the {{F1|1993}} season. \n\n[[File:Scuderia Ferrari 2008 transporter.jpg|thumb|left|A Ferrari truck displaying Ferrari's sponsors in 2008]]\nAlongside [[Jordan Grand Prix]], the team was required to run non-tobacco liveries in [[United States Grand Prix]] in the 2000s due to United States [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]] requirements, as Phillip Morris was sponsoring [[Team Penske]] at the time; a clause in the settlement allowed each tobacco company to sponsor only one sporting entity.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vadja |first1=Gabor |title=Ferrari, Jordan Sponsor Bumped by Penske at USGP, Firm Policies Itself |url=https://gaborvajda.kinja.com/ferrari-jordan-sponsor-bumped-by-penske-at-usgp-firm-1741585886 |access-date=16 May 2020 |archive-date=15 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115104444/https://gaborvajda.kinja.com/ferrari-jordan-sponsor-bumped-by-penske-at-usgp-firm-1741585886 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In September 2005, Ferrari signed an extension of the arrangement until 2011 at a time when advertising of tobacco sponsorship had become illegal in the European Union, and other major teams had withdrawn from relationships with tobacco companies (e.g. McLaren had ended its eight-year relationship with [[West (cigarette)|West]]). In reporting the deal, ''[[F1 Racing]]'' magazine judged it to be a black day for the sport, putting non-tobacco funded teams at a disadvantage and discouraging other brands from entering a sport still associated with tobacco. The magazine estimated that between 2005 and 2011, Ferrari received $1&nbsp;billion from the agreement. The last time Ferrari ran explicit tobacco sponsorship on the car was at the [[2007 Chinese Grand Prix]], with barcodes and other subliminal markers used afterwards. \n\n[[File:Charles_Leclerc,_2019_Chinese_GP.jpg|thumb|[[Ferrari SF90]], driven by Charles Leclerc, with Mission Winnow branding at the [[2019 Chinese Grand Prix]]]]\nOn 8 July 2011, it was announced that the [[Marlboro]] section of its official team name had been removed from the [[2011 British Grand Prix]] onwards, following complaints from sponsorship regulators.<ref name=\"marlboro\">{{cite news|url=http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-ferrari-drops-marlboro-from-team-name/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301211309/http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-ferrari-drops-marlboro-from-team-name/|archive-date=1 March 2013|work=speedtv.com|publisher=[[Speed (TV channel)|Speed]]|date=8 July 2011|access-date=8 July 2011|title=Ferrari Drops Marlboro From Team Name|first=Adam|last=Cooper}}</ref> As a consequence, the official team's name was reverted to Scuderia Ferrari.

Ferrari cars (including non-works entries) won the [[Mille Miglia]] eight times, the [[Targa Florio]] seven times, and the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] nine times. In this span of time, Ferrari was almost the only constructor able to support the participation in both the two most important categories of international car motor racing at the time, i.e. the [[Formula One]] and [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]] championships. The fact that it did so, achieving remarkable success with few resources and coming from an impoverished post-World War II Italy, it is seen as a testament to the prowess, passion, and dedication to the men of the Scuderia and its founder.  Ferrari scored international successes in [[sports car racing]] while still at the startup phase, taking wins in 1948 at the Mille Miglia and at the Targa Florio with the [[Ferrari 166 S]] and in 1949 at the Mille Miglia, at the12 Hours of Paris, at the [[24 Hours of Spa]], at the Targa Florio, and at the 24 Hours of Le Mans all in the same season. This remarkable streak of victories was achieved with the 2-litre [[Ferrari 166 MM]] against larger engined [[sports car]]s and already known marques. The 166MM in its famous barchetta form represented also a milestone in car design history and was soon copied abroad, ending up revisited in the lines of the [[Shelby Cobra]] of the early 1960s. Ferrari cars, being able to win at the first try at Le Mans and to triumph in all the major races of the time, become soon a product of excellence and famous, rich people started to desire and buy them.\n<gallery>\nFile:Ferrari 166 MM Barchetta.jpg|1949 [[Mille Miglia]] and [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]]-winning [[Ferrari 166 S|Ferrari 166 MM]]\nFile:Ferrari 250 MM Berlinetta - MM 2014 - (14241703734).jpg|[[Ferrari 250 MM]]\nFile:1954 Ferrari 375 Plus IMG 1240 (3801510940).jpg|[[Ferrari 375 Plus]] that won Silverstone International in 1954\nFile:1956-04-29 Mille Miglia Ferrari 290MM sn0616 Castellotti.jpg|[[Eugenio Castellotti]] winning the [[1956 Mille Miglia]] with [[Ferrari 290 MM]]\n</gallery>\nThe streak of prestigious victories continued the following seasons with wins at the [[Carrera Panamericana]] in 1951, at the 1950 and 1951 Mille Miglia, and almost at the same time Ferrari started to win in Formula One at several international events. In 1953, with the creation of the WSC, Ferrari, along with other manufacturers like [[Aston Martin]], [[Maserati]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], and [[Jaguar]] began to enter multiple factory-backed cars in races, such as the Carrera Panamericana in Mexico, the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France, the Mille Miglia in Italy, the 24 Hours of Spa in Belgium, the [[N\u00fcrburgring 1000 km]] in Germany, and the Sicilian Targa Florio. Ferrari launched a large range of sports racers over the next three years. This included the traditional compact [[Colombo V12]]-powered [[Ferrari 250 MM]]; the larger [[V12 Lampredi]]-powered [[Ferrari 340 MM|340 MM]], [[Ferrari 375 MM|375 MM]], [[Ferrari 375 Plus|375 Plus]], and [[Ferrari 410 S|410 S]]; and [[Ferrari Jano engine|Jano]]-powered [[Ferrari 290 MM|290 MM]], [[Ferrari 315 S|315 S]], and [[Ferrari 335 S|335 S]]; the four-cylinder 500, 625, 750, and 860 [[Ferrari Monza|Monzas]]; and the six-cylinder [[Ferrari 376 S|376 S]] and [[Ferrari 735 LM|735 LM]]. With this potent line-up, Ferrari was able to claim six of the first seven WSC titles (1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, and 1958).\n<gallery>\nFile:1963-05-19 Willy Mairesse, N\u00fcrburgring - Hatzenbach.jpg|The [[Willy Mairesse]] / [[John Surtees]] [[Ferrari 250 P]] heading for victory at the 1963 [[1000 km N\u00fcrburgring]]\nFile:1964-05-31 Scarfiotti, Ludovico - Ferrari.jpg|[[Ferrari 275 P]] driven by [[Ludovico Scarfiotti]] at the 1964 [[1000 km N\u00fcrburgring]]\nFile:1966 24 Hours of Le Mans 21 (4771041799).jpg|[[Ferrari 330 P3]] at the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]]\nFile:Ferrari_330_P4_1967.jpg|[[Ferrari 330 P4]] s/n 0856 at [[1000km Monza]], 1967\n</gallery>\nIn the first half of the 1960s, Ferrari continued to enjoy considerable success, including six overall wins in a row at the 24 Hours of Le Mans (from 1960 to 1965). With the introduction of the [[Sports Prototypes]] class, the team developed the [[Ferrari P]] series of cars. Up to the 1964 season, they faced little competition from major manufacturers, as only [[Porsche]] stayed in the series albeit with smaller engined cars that were able to be competitive only in selected races where engine power was less relevant and overall lightness was a premium, such as at the Targa Florio or at the Nurburgring. At the end of 1963, a conflict between Ferrari and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] over the potential acquisition of the Italian manufacturer by the American giant carmaker gave way to the famous \"Ford vs. Ferrari war\", a sort of modern David vs. Goliath battle that changed international motorsport forever. Ford decided to enter endurance racing pouring unprecedented amounts of money in the development of a racing department in England with the objective to beat Ferrari in this category of races. The [[Ford GT40]] was born and developed in the years following that initiative. After a few years, Ford entered also the Formula One championship. No European manufacturer was able to compete with this level of investment at the time, and Ford engines dominated Formula One racing for over a decade. Moreover, the advent of the American carmaker brought along munificent sponsorships from American tobacco and oil companies, in addition to a bigger level of media coverage to the sport. Ferrari was able to prevail in the 1964 and 1965 seasons both in the championship and at the 24 Hours of Le Mans but had to concede Ford the victory in the 1966 championship and Le Mans race, when the 7-litre GT40 had a dominant season.\n<gallery>\nFile:Merzario, Arturo , Ferrari 312 PB 1973-05-27.jpg|[[Ferrari 312 PB]]\nFile:Ferrari_333_SP_-_Mauro_Baldi,_Giampero_Moretti_%26_Didier_Theys_head_underthe_Dunlop_Bridge_at_the_1998_Le_Mans_(51885183588).jpg|[[Ferrari 333 SP]]\n</gallery>\nIn 1967, the last where Ford and Ferrari could battle on the tarmac, saw Ferrari taking the championship but losing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. This last race was really controversial as the race timing completely disappeared for some hours during nighttime before reappearing with altered results. This and other controversial aspects of the race were recounted by the late [[Mauro Forghieri]], famously quoting a dialogue with Mr Finance, then in charge of organising the Le Mans race. A change of rules denying the participation to prototype cars for the 1968 season forced Ferrari out from the championship and in this way the Ferrari vs. Ford battle in endurance racing met its end. The 1970s was the last decade Ferrari entered as a works effort in sports car racing. After an uninspired performance in the {{f1|1973}} season, [[Enzo Ferrari]] stopped all development of sports cars in prototype and [[grand touring]] (GT) racing at the end of the year to concentrate on Formula One. This choice paid off and Ferrari was able to contend the Formula One title already from the {{f1|1974}} season and then went on to win several titles in the following years. After Ferrari withdrawal from the WSC, the series soon saw a decline in the level of competition and reduced almost to a one-contender show until the 1987 season, when several manufacturers entered the championship again. Since the 1985 season, the championship was declassed to a team one and there was not a largely participated world manufacturer title for sportscars until the inception of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] (WEC). Ferrari cars were raced in a range of classes, such as GT racing by other entrants, but not by the factory Scuderia Ferrari team. In the 1990s, Ferrari returned to sports prototypes as a constructor with the [[Ferrari 333 SP]] with success, although Scuderia Ferrari itself never raced this car.\n[[File:AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE Calado Silverstone 2018.jpg|thumb|left|#51 AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE, [[2018 6 Hours of Silverstone]]|alt=]]\nFrom 2006, Ferrari returned to GT car racing with a factory effort Ferrari Competizioni GT, in partnership with racing teams, such as [[AF Corse]], [[Kessel Racing]], and [[Risi Competizione]], among others. With factory support, these teams achieved great success in major international GT2 and GTE Pro/GTLM competitions. Starting from this same year, AF Corse won the GT2 manufacturers' title along with the team's title each year it was contested in the [[FIA GT Championship]]. It also took two drivers' titles in 2006 and 2008 in the same series. Following the demise of the GT Championship and the creation of a new world championship series for endurance racing by the FIA, Ferrari/AF Corse continued to enjoy much success in GT racing. Of the ten GT manufacturers' championships contested from the introduction of the WEC championship in 2012, Ferrari won seven editions (2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2021, and 2022). Almost the same happened with the GT drivers' title, which had been awarded since the 2013 season, with Ferrari/AF Corse winning five out of nine editions (2013, 2014, 2017, 2021, and 2022). To this tally, AF Corse added four out of six LMGTE PRO team trophies. Several other trophies were won also in the LMGTE PRO/AM class in the WEC. Other victories were also achieved in international and national championships both in GT2/LmGTE and GT3 classes all over the world. Among the victories in prestigious racing events are the two GT2 class wins scored at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2008 and 2009 by Risi Competizione and the four GTE Pro class wins scored by AF Corse at the same event: in 2012 and 2014 with the [[Ferrari 458 GT2]] driven by [[Gianmaria Bruni]], [[Giancarlo Fisichella]], and [[Toni Vilander]]; in 2019 with the [[Ferrari 488 GTE]] Ferrari 488 GTE driven by [[Alessandro Pier Guidi]], [[James Calado]], and [[Daniel Serra]]; and in 2021 with the same car driven by Pier Guidi, Calado, and [[C\u00f4me Ledogar]]. A [[Ferrari 488 GT3]] scored the overall win at the [[2017 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour|2017 12 Hours of Bathurst]] and the [[2021 24 Hours of Spa]].\n[[File:2023 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps Ferrari AF Corse Ferrari 499P No.51 (DSC09249).jpg|thumb|[[Ferrari 499P]]]]\nIn 2023, after a 50-year hiatus, Ferrari returned to the top class of endurance racing with its new [[Ferrari 499P]], a [[Le Mans Hypercar]] prototype. Subsequently, they were able to compete for the world title and in prestigious events, such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], and the [[12 Hours of Sebring]]. The 499P was managed by AF Corse and this caused a restructuring of the GT activities of the successful Italian team. At the [[2023 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Ferrari achieved its first Le Mans victory since 1965 with the No. 51 499P driven by Pier Guidi, Calado, and [[Antonio Giovinazzi]]. In the same year, a [[Ferrari 296 GT3]]  run by Frikadelli Racing won the [[24 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring]].\n\n==Personnel and statistics==\n===Formula One results===\n{{main|Ferrari Grand Prix results}}\nAs a constructor, Ferrari has achieved the following statistics:\n* Constructors' Championship winning percentage: {{Percentage|16|66|1}}<!-- 16/66 [1958\u20132023] -->\n* Drivers' Championship winning percentage: {{Percentage|15|74|1}}<!-- 15/74 [1950\u20132023] -->\n* Winning percentage: {{Percentage|{{F1cstat|FER|wins}}|{{F1cstat|FER|entries}}|1}}{{efn|name=wins constructor}}\n\n===Formula One records===\nFerrari has achieved unparalleled success in Formula One and holds many significant records including (all numbers are based on World Championship events only).
