By 1947 Ferrari had begun building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside Formula One are winning the [[World Sportscar Championship]], [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], [[24 Hours of Spa]], [[24 Hours of Daytona]], [[12 Hours of Sebring]], [[Bathurst 12 Hour]], races for [[Grand tourer]] cars and racing on road courses of the [[Targa Florio]], the [[Mille Miglia]] and the [[Carrera Panamericana]]. The team is also known for its passionate support base, known as the ''[[Tifosi#Formula One|tifosi]]''. The [[Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]] is regarded as the team's home race.\n\nAs a constructor in Formula One, Ferrari has a record 16 [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championships]]. Their most recent Constructors' Championship was won in 2008. The team also holds the record for the most [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championships]] with 15, won by nine different drivers: [[Alberto Ascari]], [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Mike Hawthorn]], [[Phil Hill]], [[John Surtees]], [[Niki Lauda]], [[Jody Scheckter]], [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://formula1.ferrari.com/en/|title=Scuderia Ferrari Formula 1|publisher=Scuderia Ferrari|access-date=5 February 2016}}</ref> R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen's title in {{f1|2007}} is the most recent for the team.

February 2019</ref> However, Ferrari himself had raced in CMN (Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali) and [[Alfa Romeo]] cars before that date. The idea came about on the night of 16 November at a dinner in [[Bologna]], where Ferrari solicited financial help from textile heirs Augusto and Alfredo Caniato and wealthy amateur racer Mario Tadini. He then gathered a team which at its peak included over forty drivers, most of whom raced in various [[Alfa Romeo 8C]] cars; Ferrari himself continued racing, with moderate success, until the birth of his first son [[Alfredo Ferrari|Dino]] in 1932. The prancing horse blazon first appeared at the 1932 [[Spa 24 Hours]] in Belgium on a two-car team of [[Alfa Romeo 8C]] 2300 Spiders, which finished first and second.\n\nIn 1933 Alfa Romeo experienced economic difficulties and withdrew its team from racing. From then, the Scuderia Ferrari became the acting racing team of Alfa Romeo when the factory released to the Scuderia the up to date [[Monoposto]] Tipo B racers. In 1935 Enzo Ferrari and Luigi Bazzi built the [[Alfa Romeo Bimotore]], the first car to wear a Ferrari badge on the radiator cowl. Ferrari managed numerous established drivers (notably [[Tazio Nuvolari]], [[Giuseppe Campari]], [[Achille Varzi]] and [[Louis Chiron]]) and several talented rookies (such as [[Tadini]], [[Guy Moll]], [[Carlo Maria Pintacuda]], and [[Antonio Brivio]]) from his headquarters in Viale Trento e Trieste, [[Modena, Italy|Modena]], [[Italy]], until 1938, at which point Alfa Romeo made him the manager of the factory racing division, [[Alfa Corse]]. Alfa Romeo had bought the shares of the Scuderia Ferrari in 1937 and transferred, from 1 January 1938,<ref name=\"Henry12\">{{cite book| last = Henry| first = Alan| author-link = Alan Henry| title = Ferrari&nbsp;\u2013 The Grand Prix Cars| publisher=Hazleton| page = 12| edition = 2nd| year = 1989}}</ref> the official racing activity to [[Alfa Corse]] whose new buildings were being erected next to the Alfa factory at [[Portello, Milan|Portello]] ([[Milan]]). The Viale Trento e Trieste facilities remained active to assist the racing customers.\n\nEnzo Ferrari disagreed with this policy change and was dismissed by Alfa in 1939. In October 1939, Enzo Ferrari left Alfa when the racing activity stopped and founded Auto Avio Costruzioni Ferrari, which also manufactured machine tools. The agreement with Alfa included the condition that he would not use the Ferrari name on cars for four years.\n\nIn the winter of 1939\u20131940, Ferrari started work on a racecar of his own, the [[Auto Avio Costruzioni 815|Tipo 815]] (eight cylinders, 1.5&nbsp;L displacement).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kW5eCAAAQBAJ&q=Ferrari+working+tipo+815+1939&pg=PT16|title=Collection Editions: Ferrari In Formula One|last=Buckland|first=Damien|date=4 February 2015|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=9781326174880}}</ref> The 815s, designed by [[Alberto Massimino]], were thus the first true Ferrari cars, but after [[Alberto Ascari]] and the Marchese Lotario Rangoni Machiavelli di Modena drove them in the 1940 [[Mille Miglia]], [[World War II]] put a temporary end to racing and the 815s saw no more competition.

When regulations changed in 2014, Cosworth decided not to make the new V6 turbo engines.

In the 1960s, Ferrari withdrew from several races in 'strike' actions.\n\nIn 1987, Ferrari considered abandoning Formula One for the American IndyCar series. This threat was used as a bargaining tool with the FIA&nbsp;\u2013 Enzo Ferrari offered to cancel the IndyCar Project and commit to Formula One on the condition that the technical regulations were not changed to exclude V12 engines. The FIA agreed to this, and the IndyCar project was shelved, although a car, the [[Ferrari 637]], had already been constructed.\n\nIn 2009, it had emerged that Ferrari had an FIA-sanctioned veto on the technical regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/75327|title=Ferrari pushing to stay under own terms|author=Jonathan Noble|date=15 May 2009|work=Autosport}}</ref>\n\n===Team orders controversies===\nTeam orders have proven controversial at several points in Ferrari's history.\n\nAt the [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix]], the two Ferraris were leading with [[Gilles Villeneuve]] ahead of [[Didier Pironi]]. The team showed the 'slow' sign to its drivers, and, as per a pre-race agreement, the driver leading at that point was expected to take the win of the Grand Prix. Villeneuve slowed and expected that Pironi would follow, but the latter did not and passed Villeneuve. Villeneuve was angered by what he saw as a betrayal by his teammate and, at one point, had even refused to go onto the podium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/13877.html|title=Pironi leaves Villeneuve fuming|work=ESPN UK}}</ref> This feud is often considered to have been a contributory factor to his fatal accident in qualifying at the next race, the [[1982 Belgian Grand Prix]].\n\nAt the [[2002 Austrian Grand Prix]], after having started from pole position and leading the first 70 laps, Rubens Barrichello was instructed to let Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher pass him, a move that proved to be unpopular among many Formula One fans and the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]], the sport's governing body.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/may/12/formulaone.theobserver|title=Barrichello gets pole in Austria|work=The Guardian|date=12 May 2002|access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/05/13/austria.ferrari/index.html|title=F1 summons Schumacher, Barrichello |date=13 May 2002|publisher=CNN|access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref> Following this incident and others in which team orders were used, such as [[McLaren]]'s use of them at the [[1997 European Grand Prix]] and at the [[1998 Australian Grand Prix]], and [[Jordan Grand Prix]]'s at the [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix]], team orders in Formula One were officially banned ahead of the [[2003 Formula One season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mclaren.com/formula1/team/11-pitstops-that-changed-the-face-of-a-race/|title=McLaren Formula 1 \u2013 11 pitstops that changed the face of a race|publisher=McLaren|access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/79515-spa-francorchamps-grand-prix-1998-the-greatest-f1-race-ever|title=Spa Francorchamps Grand Prix 1998: The Greatest F1 Race Ever?|author=Mary O'Shea|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>CNN.com \u2013 F1 teams are given orders warning \u2013 26 September 2003</ref>\n\nOn lap 49 of the [[2010 German Grand Prix]], Fernando Alonso went past Felipe Massa for the race lead, after Ferrari had informed Massa that Alonso was 'faster than him'.

Marlboro had already been Ferrari's minor sponsor since the {{F1|1984}} season and increased to the team's major sponsorship in the {{F1|1993}} season. \n\nAlongside [[Jordan Grand Prix]], the team was required to run non-tobacco liveries in [[United States Grand Prix]] in the 2000s due to United States [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]] requirements (Phillip Morris was sponsoring [[Team Penske]] at the time; a clause in the settlement allowed each tobacco company to sponsor only one sporting entity).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vadja |first1=Gabor |title=Ferrari, Jordan Sponsor Bumped by Penske at USGP, Firm Policies Itself |url=https://gaborvajda.kinja.com/ferrari-jordan-sponsor-bumped-by-penske-at-usgp-firm-1741585886 |access-date=16 May 2020 |archive-date=15 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115104444/https://gaborvajda.kinja.com/ferrari-jordan-sponsor-bumped-by-penske-at-usgp-firm-1741585886 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In September 2005 Ferrari signed an extension of the arrangement until 2011 at a time when advertising of tobacco sponsorship had become illegal in the European Union, and other major teams had withdrawn from relationships with tobacco companies (e.g., McLaren had ended its eight-year relationship with [[West (cigarette)|West]]). In reporting the deal, ''[[F1 Racing]]'' magazine judged it to be a 'black day' for the sport, putting non-tobacco funded teams at a disadvantage and discouraging other brands from entering a sport still associated with tobacco. The magazine estimated that between 2005 and 2011, Ferrari received $1&nbsp;billion from the agreement. The last time Ferrari ran explicit tobacco sponsorship on the car was in 2007 {{F1 GP|2007|Chinese}}, with barcodes and other subliminal markers used afterwards. \n\nOn 8 July 2011, it was announced that the '[[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]]' section of its official team name had been removed from the [[2011 British Grand Prix]] onwards, following complaints from sponsorship regulators.<ref name=\"marlboro\">{{cite news|url=http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-ferrari-drops-marlboro-from-team-name/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301211309/http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-ferrari-drops-marlboro-from-team-name/|archive-date=1 March 2013|work=speedtv.com|publisher=[[Speed (TV channel)|Speed]]|date=8 July 2011|access-date=8 July 2011|title=Ferrari Drops Marlboro From Team Name|first=Adam|last=Cooper}}</ref> As a consequence, the official team's name was reverted to ''Scuderia Ferrari''.

Ferrari cars (including non-works entries) won the Mille Miglia 8 times, the Targa Florio 7 times, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans 9 times. In this span of time, Ferrari was almost the only constructor able to support the participation in both the two most important categories of international car motor racing at the time, i.e., the formula one and endurance championships. The fact that it did so achieving remarkable success with few resources and coming from an impoverished post-WW2 Italy, it's a testament to the prowess, passion and dedication to the men of the Scuderia and its founder.  Ferrari scored international successes in sportscar racing while still at the startup phase, taking wins in 1948 at the Mille Miglia and at the Targa Florio with its 166S model and in 1949 at the Mille Miglia, at the 12h of Paris, at the 24h of SPA, at the Targa Florio and at the 24h of Le Mans all in the same season. This remarkable streak of victories was achieved with the 2-litre 166MM model against larger engined sportscars and already known marques. The 166MM in its famous \"barchetta\" form represented also a milestone in car design history and was soon copied abroad, ending up revisited in the lines of the Shelby Cobra of the early 60s. Ferrari cars, being able to win at the first try at Le Mans and to triumph in all the major races of the time, become soon a product of excellence and famous, rich people started to desire and buy them. The streak of prestigious victories continued the following seasons with wins at the Carrera Panamericana in 1951, at the 1950 and 1951 Mille Miglia and almost at the same time Ferrari started to win in Formula 1 at several international events. In 1953, with the creation of the World Sportscar Championship, Scuderia Ferrari, along with other manufacturers such as Aston Martin, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar began to enter multiple factory-backed cars in races such as the Carrera Panamericana in Mexico, the Le Mans 24 Hours in France, the Mille Miglia in Italy, the 24h of SPA in Belgium, The 1000Km of the Nurburgring in Germany and the Sicilian Targa Florio. Ferrari launched a large range of sports racers over the next three years. This included the traditional compact Colombo V12-powered 250 MM; the larger V12 Lampredi 340 MM, 375 MM, 375 Plus and 410 S; and Jano 290 MM, 315 S and 335 S; the four-cylinder 500, 625, 750, and 860 Monzas, and the six-cylinder 376 S and 735 LM. With this potent line-up, Ferrari was able to claim six of the first seven WSC titles: 1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, and 1958. In the first half of the 60s, the Scuderia continued to enjoy considerable success, including six overall wins in a row at the 24h of Le Mans, from 1960 to 1965. With the introduction of the Sports Prototypes class, Ferrari developed the P series of cars, but, up to the 1964 season, faced little competition from major manufacturers, as only Porsche stayed in the series albeit with smaller engined cars that were able to be competitive only in selected races where engine power was less relevant and overall lightness was a premium, such as at the Targa Florio or at the Nurburgring. At the end of 1963, a conflict between Ferrari and Ford over the potential acquisition of the Italian manufacturer by the American giant carmaker gave way to the famous \"Ford vs Ferrari war\", a sort of modern David vs Goliath battle, that changed international motorsport forever. Ford decided to enter endurance racing pouring unprecedented amounts of money in the development of a racing department in England with the objective to beat Ferrari in this category of races. The Ford Gt40 was born and developed in the years following that initiative. After a few years, Ford entered also the F1 championship. No European manufacturer was able to compete with this level of investment at the time, and Ford engines dominated F1 racing for over a decade. Moreover, the advent of the American carmaker brought along munificent sponsorships from American tobacco and oil companies and a bigger level of media coverage to the sport. The story of this historical battle would require a dedicated book but, in synthesis, it could be said that Ferrari was able to prevail in the 1964 and 1965 seasons both in the championship and at the 24h of Le Mans but had to concede Ford the victory in the 1966 championship and Le Mans race, when the 7litre Gt40 had a dominant season. The following year, the last where Ford and Ferrari could battle on the tarmac saw Ferrari taking the championship but losing at the 24h of Le Mans race. This last race was really controversial as the race timing completely disappeared for some hours during nighttime before reappearing with altered results. This and other controversial aspects of the race were recounted by the late Mauro Forghieri, famously quoting a dialogue with Mr Finance, then in charge of organizing the Le Mans race. A change of rules denying the participation to prototype cars for the 1968 season forced Ferrari out from the championship and in this way the Ferrari Vs Ford battle in endurance racing met its end. The 1970s was the last decade Ferrari entered as a works effort in sports car racing. After an uninspired performance in the 1973 F1 World Championship, Enzo Ferrari stopped all development of sports cars in prototype and GT racing at the end of the year to concentrate on Formula One. As the events have shown, this choice paid and Ferrari was able to contend the f1 title already from the 1974 season and then went on to win several titles in the following years. After Ferrari withdrawal from the world sportscar championship, the series soon saw a decline in the level of competition and reduced almost to a one-contender show until the 1987 season, when several manufacturers entered  the championship again. Since the 1985 season, though, the championship was declassed to a team one and there was not a largely participated world manufacturer title for sportscars until the inception of the FIA WEC series. Ferrari cars were raced in a range of classes such as GT Racing by other entrants, but not by the factory Scuderia Ferrari team. In the 1990s, Ferrari returned to Sports prototypes as a constructor with the 333SP with success, although Scuderia Ferrari itself never raced this car.\n\nFrom 2006 Ferrari returned to GT car racing with a factory effort \"Ferrari competizioni GT\" in partnership with racing teams such as AF Corse, Kessel Racing and Risi Competizione among others. With factory support, these teams achieved great success in major international GT2 and GTE Pro/GTLM competitions. Starting from this same year, AF Corse won the Gt2 manfacturer's title along with the team's title each year it was contested in the FIA GT Championship. It also took 2 driver's titles in 2006 and 2008 in the same series. Following the demise of the FIA GT Championship and the creation of a new world championship series for endurance racing by the FIA, Ferrari/AF Corse continued to enjoy much success in GT racing. Of the 10 GT manufacturer's championships contested from the introduction of the FIA WEC championship in 2012, Ferrari won 7 editions, in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2021 and 2022. Almost the same happened with the GT drivers' title, which had been awarded since the 2013 season, Ferrari/AF Corse winning 5 out 9 editions, in 2013, 2014, 2017, 2021 and 2022. To this tally, AF Corse added 4 out of 6 LMGTE PRO team trophies. Several other trophies were won also in the LMGTE PRO/AM class in the FIA WEC. Other victories were also achieved in international and national championships both in Gt2/LmGTE and Gt3 classes all over the world. Among the victories in prestigious racing events, it is possible to cite the two Gt2 class wins scored at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2008 and 2009 by Risi Competizione and the four GTE Pro class wins scored by AF Corse at the same event: in 2012 and 2014 with the Ferrari 458 GT2 driven by Bruni, Fisichella, and Vilander, in 2019 with the Ferrari 488 GTE driven by Pier Guidi, Calado and Serra, and in 2021 with the same car driven by Pier Guidi, Calado and C\u00f4me Ledogar. A Ferrari 488 GT3 scored the overall win at the [[2017 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour|2017 12 Hours of Bathurst]] and the [[2021 24 Hours of Spa]].\n \nIn 2023, after a 50-year hiatus, Ferrari has returned to the top class of endurance racing with its new 499P hypercar prototype. Sussequently they will be able to compete for the world title and in prestigious events such as the 24h of Le Mans, the 24h of Daytona, the 12h of Sebring etc. The 499P will be managed by AF Corse and this caused a restructuring of the GT activities of the successful Italian team.\n\nIn the [[2023 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Ferrari achieved its first Le Mans victory since 1965 with the No. 51 499P driven by [[Alessandro Pier Guidi]], [[James Calado]] and [[Antonio Giovinazzi]]. In the same year a Ferrari 296 GT3 run by Frikadelli Racing won the [[24 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring]].\n\n==Personnel and statistics==\n===Formula One results===\n{{Main|Ferrari Grand Prix results}}\n\nAs a constructor, Ferrari has achieved the following:\n* Constructors' Championship winning percentage: {{Percentage|16|66|1}}<!-- 16/66 [1958\u20132023] -->\n* Drivers' Championship winning percentage: {{Percentage|15|74|1}}<!-- 15/74 [1950\u20132023] -->\n* Winning percentage: {{Percentage|{{F1cstat|FER|wins}}|{{F1cstat|FER|entries}}|1}}{{efn|name=wins constructor}}\n\nFerrari has achieved unparalleled success in [[Formula One]] and holds many significant records including (all numbers are based on World Championship events only):\n{|class=\"wikitable\n!Record\n!As a team\n!As a constructor\n|-\n|Most Constructors' Championships || 16 || 16\n|-\n|Most Drivers' Championships || 15 || 15\n|-\n|Most Grands Prix participated || {{F1cstat|FER|entries}}{{efn|name=entries team}} || {{F1cstat|FER|entries}}<!-- Both of these counts were 1054 for 1950\u20132022. -->\n|-\n|Most Grands Prix started || {{sum|{{f1cstat|FER|starts}}|-1}}{{efn|name=starts team}} || {{F1cstat|FER|starts}}{{efn|name=starts constructor}}<!-- These counts were 1051 & 1052 for 1950\u20132022. -->\n|-\n|Most wins || {{sum|{{f1cstat|FER|wins}}|-1}}{{efn|name=wins team}} || {{f1cstat|FER|wins}}{{efn|name=wins constructor}}<!-- These counts were 241 & 242 for 1950\u20132022. -->\n|-\n|Most podium finishes || {{sum|{{f1cstat|FER|podiums}}|-5}}<!-- Must be \"+1\" for EVERY PODIUM PLACE gained (i.e., up to 2 per race) --> (in {{sum|{{f1cstat|FER|podiumsraces}}|-3}}<!-- Must be \"+1\" only for the races WITH AT LEAST ONE PODIUM PLACE gained --> races){{efn|name=podiums team}}{{efn|name=Gilles1982USA|Does not include [[Gilles Villeneuve]]'s third-place finish in [[1982 United States Grand Prix West]] from which he, despite having participated in a podium ceremony, was eventually disqualified.}}<!-- This count was 793 (in 603 races) for 1950\u20132022. --> || {{f1cstat|FER|podiums}}<!-- This should be 5+(the team's stat) --> (in {{f1cstat|FER|podiumsraces}}<!-- This should be 3+(the team's stat) --> races){{efn|name=Gilles1982USA}}<!-- This count was 798 (in 606 races) for 1950\u20132022. -->\n|-\n|Most 1\u20132 finishes || 84{{efn|Does not include the [[1952 Swiss Grand Prix]], where a team-entered Ferrari finished first, and a privately entered Ferrari finished second.}} || 85{{efn|Includes the [[1952 Swiss Grand Prix]], where a team-entered Ferrari finished first, and a privately entered Ferrari finished second.}}<!-- These counts were 84 & 85 for 1950\u20132022. -->\n|-\n|Most [[pole position]]s || {{f1cstat|FER|poles}} || {{f1cstat|FER|poles}}<!-- Both of these counts were 242 for 1950\u20132022. -->\n|-\n|Most qualifying 1\u20132s<!-- This differs from front-row lock-outs as grids haven't always had two cars per row. --> || 83<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.statsf1.com/en/statistiques/constructeur/pole/double.aspx|title=Statistics Constructors \u2013 Grands Prix \u2013 Pole positions by one\u2013two|website=StatsF1.com|access-date=2023-10-29}}</ref>{{efn|Record shared with [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]]}}|| 83<ref name=\":0\" />{{efn|Record shared with [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]]}}<!-- Both of these counts were 82 for 1950\u20132022. -->\n|-\n|Most Constructors' Championship points || <!-- Couldn't find a reliable source for WCC points scored by works entries only -->|| {{f1cstat|FER|totalpoints}}<!-- This count was 9,266 for 1950\u20132022.
