However, by 1947 Ferrari had begun building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside Formula One are winning the [[World Sportscar Championship]], [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], [[24 Hours of Spa]], [[24 Hours of Daytona]], [[12 Hours of Sebring]], [[Bathurst 12 Hour]], races for [[Grand tourer]] cars and racing on road courses of the [[Targa Florio]], the [[Mille Miglia]] and the [[Carrera Panamericana]]. The team is also known for its passionate support base, known as the ''[[Tifosi#Formula One|tifosi]]''. The [[Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]] is regarded as the team's home race.\n\nAs a constructor in Formula One, Ferrari has a record 16 [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championships]]. Their most recent Constructors' Championship was won in 2008. The team also holds the record for the most [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championships]] with 15, won by nine different drivers: [[Alberto Ascari]], [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Mike Hawthorn]], [[Phil Hill]], [[John Surtees]], [[Niki Lauda]], [[Jody Scheckter]], [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://formula1.ferrari.com/en/|title=Scuderia Ferrari Formula 1|publisher=Scuderia Ferrari|access-date=5 February 2016}}</ref> R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen's title in {{f1|2007}} is the most recent for the team. The [[2020 Tuscan Grand Prix]] marked Ferrari's 1000th Grand Prix in Formula One.\n\nMichael Schumacher is the team's most successful driver. Joining the team in {{f1|1996}} and driving for them until his first retirement in {{f1|2006}}, he won five consecutive drivers' titles and 72 Grands Prix for the team. His titles came consecutively between {{f1|2000}} and {{f1|2004}}, and the team won consecutive constructors' titles between {{f1|1999}} and [[2004 Formula One World Championship|2004]]; this was the team's most successful period.

February 2019</ref> However, Ferrari himself had raced in CMN (Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali) and [[Alfa Romeo]] cars before that date. The idea came about on the night of 16 November at a dinner in [[Bologna]], where Ferrari solicited financial help from textile heirs Augusto and Alfredo Caniato and wealthy amateur racer Mario Tadini. He then gathered a team which at its peak included over forty drivers, most of whom raced in various [[Alfa Romeo 8C]] cars; Ferrari himself continued racing, with moderate success, until the birth of his first son [[Alfredo Ferrari|Dino]] in 1932. The well-known prancing horse blazon first appeared at the 1932 [[Spa 24 Hours]] in Belgium on a two-car team of [[Alfa Romeo 8C]] 2300 Spiders, which finished first and second.\n\nIn 1933 Alfa Romeo experienced economic difficulties and withdrew its in-house team from racing. From then, the Scuderia Ferrari became the acting racing team of Alfa Romeo when the factory released to the Scuderia the up-to-date [[Monoposto]] Tipo B racers. In 1935 Enzo Ferrari and Luigi Bazzi built the [[Alfa Romeo Bimotore]], the first car to wear a Ferrari badge on the radiator cowl. Ferrari managed numerous established drivers (notably [[Tazio Nuvolari]], [[Giuseppe Campari]], [[Achille Varzi]] and [[Louis Chiron]]) and several talented rookies (such as [[Tadini]], [[Guy Moll]], [[Carlo Maria Pintacuda]], and [[Antonio Brivio]]) from his headquarters in Viale Trento e Trieste, [[Modena, Italy|Modena]], [[Italy]], until 1938, at which point Alfa Romeo made him the manager of the factory racing division, [[Alfa Corse]]. Alfa Romeo had bought the shares of the Scuderia Ferrari in 1937 and transferred, from 1 January 1938,<ref name=\"Henry12\">{{cite book| last = Henry| first = Alan| author-link = Alan Henry| title = Ferrari&nbsp;\u2013 The Grand Prix Cars| publisher=Hazleton| page = 12| edition = 2nd| year = 1989}}</ref> the official racing activity to [[Alfa Corse]] whose new buildings were being erected next to the Alfa factory at [[Portello, Milan|Portello]] ([[Milan]]). The Viale Trento e Trieste facilities then remained active to assist the racing customers.\n\nEnzo Ferrari disagreed with this policy change and was finally dismissed by Alfa in 1939. In October 1939, Enzo Ferrari left Alfa when the racing activity stopped and founded his own company Auto Avio Costruzioni Ferrari, which also manufactured machine tools. The deal with Alfa included the condition that he would not use the Ferrari name on cars for four years.\n\nIn the winter of 1939\u20131940, Ferrari started work on a racecar of his own, the [[Auto Avio Costruzioni 815|Tipo 815]] (eight cylinders, 1.5&nbsp;L displacement).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kW5eCAAAQBAJ&q=Ferrari+working+tipo+815+1939&pg=PT16|title=Collection Editions: Ferrari In Formula One|last=Buckland|first=Damien|date=4 February 2015|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=9781326174880}}</ref> The 815s, designed by [[Alberto Massimino]], were thus the first true Ferrari cars, but after [[Alberto Ascari]] and the Marchese Lotario Rangoni Machiavelli di Modena drove them in the 1940 [[Mille Miglia]], [[World War II]] put a temporary end to racing and the 815s saw no more competition. Ferrari continued to manufacture machine tools (specifically oleodynamic grinding machines); in 1943, he moved his headquarters to [[Maranello]], where in 1944 it was bombed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\nRules for a Grand Prix World Championship had been laid out before the war, but it took several years afterwards for the series to get going; meanwhile, Ferrari rebuilt his works in Maranello and constructed the 12-cylinder, 1.5&nbsp;L [[Ferrari Tipo 125|Tipo 125]], which competed at several non-championship Grands Prix. The car made its debut in the [[1948 Italian Grand Prix]] with [[Raymond Sommer]] and achieved its first win at the minor Circuito di Garda with [[Giuseppe Farina]].\n\nAfter the four-year condition expired, the road car company was called Ferrari S.p.A., while the name SEFAC ('''''S'''ociet\u00e0 Per Azioni '''E'''scercizio '''F'''abbriche '''A'''utomobili e '''C'''orse'') was used for the racing department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/ferrari-s-p-a-history/|title=Ferrari S.p.A. History|website=fundinguniverse.com|access-date=19 November 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Headquarters===\nThe team was initially based in [[Modena]] from its pre-war founding until 1943, when Enzo Ferrari moved the team to a new factory in [[Maranello]] in 1943,<ref name=\"Henry13\">\n{{cite book\n| last = Henry\n| first = Alan\n| author-link = Alan Henry\n| title = Ferrari&nbsp;\u2013 The Grand Prix Cars\n| publisher=Hazleton\n| page = 13\n| edition = 2nd\n| year = 1989\n}}\n</ref> and both Scuderia Ferrari and Ferrari's road car factory remain at Maranello to this day. The team owns and operates a test track on the same site, the [[Fiorano Circuit]] built in 1972, which is used for testing road and race cars.\n\n===Identity===\nThe team is named after its founder, [[Enzo Ferrari]]. ''Scuderia'' is Italian for a stable reserved for racing horses<ref>[http://www.wordreference.com/iten/scuderia scuderia&nbsp;\u2013 Dizionario italiano-inglese WordReference]. Wordreference.com. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref> and is also commonly applied to Italian motor racing teams.\n\nThe prancing horse was the symbol used on Italian [[World War I]] ace [[Francesco Baracca]]'s fighter plane. It became the logo of Ferrari after the fallen ace's parents, close acquaintances of Enzo Ferrari, suggested that Ferrari use the symbol as the logo of the ''Scuderia'', telling him it would 'bring him good luck'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.museobaracca.it/The-prancing-horse|title=The prancing horse|publisher=Museo Francesco Baracca|access-date=30 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Formula One==\n{{Main|Grand Prix racing history of Scuderia Ferrari}}\n\n===Engine supply===\nFerrari has always produced engines for its own Formula One cars, and has also supplied engines to other teams. Ferrari has previously supplied engines to [[Minardi]] (1991), [[BMS Scuderia Italia|Scuderia Italia]] (1992\u20131993), [[Sauber]] (1997\u20132005 with engines badged as '[[Petronas]]', and 2010\u20132018), [[Prost Grand Prix|Prost]] (2001, badged '[[Acer Inc.|Acer]]'), [[Red Bull Racing]] (2006), [[Spyker F1|Spyker]] (2007), [[Scuderia Toro Rosso]] (2007\u20132013, 2016), [[Force India]] (2008) and [[Marussia F1|Marussia]] (2014\u20132015). When regulations changed in 2014, Cosworth decided not to make the new V6 turbo engines. Marussia, Cosworth's only team at the time, signed a multi-year deal with Ferrari, starting in 2014. {{As of|2022|}}, Ferrari supplies the [[Haas F1 Team]] and [[Alfa Romeo Racing]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/115679|title=Haas F1 Team seals multi-year Ferrari engine deal from 2016|work=[[Autosport]]|date=3 September 2014|access-date=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with governing body===\nFerrari did not enter the first-ever race of the championship, the [[1950 British Grand Prix]] due to a dispute with the organisers over \"start money\". In the 1960s, Ferrari withdrew from several races in 'strike' actions.\n\nIn 1987, Ferrari considered abandoning Formula One for the American IndyCar series. This threat was used as a bargaining tool with the FIA&nbsp;\u2013 Enzo Ferrari offered to cancel the IndyCar Project and commit to Formula One on the condition that the technical regulations were not changed to exclude V12 engines. The FIA agreed to this, and the IndyCar project was shelved, although a car, the [[Ferrari 637]], had already been constructed.\n\nIn 2009, it had emerged that Ferrari had an FIA-sanctioned veto on the technical regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/75327|title=Ferrari pushing to stay under own terms|author=Jonathan Noble|date=15 May 2009|work=Autosport}}</ref>\n\n===Team orders controversies===\nTeam orders have proven controversial at several points in Ferrari's history.\n\nAt the [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix]], the two Ferraris were leading with [[Gilles Villeneuve]] ahead of [[Didier Pironi]]. The team showed the 'slow' sign to its drivers, and, as per a pre-race agreement, the driver leading at that point was expected to take the win of the Grand Prix. Villeneuve slowed and expected that Pironi would follow, but the latter did not and passed Villeneuve. Villeneuve was angered by what he saw as a betrayal by his teammate and, at one point, had even refused to go onto the podium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/13877.html|title=Pironi leaves Villeneuve fuming|work=ESPN UK}}</ref> This feud is often considered to have been a contributory factor to his fatal accident in qualifying at the next race, the [[1982 Belgian Grand Prix]].\n\nAt the [[2002 Austrian Grand Prix]], after having started from pole position and leading the first 70 laps, Rubens Barrichello was instructed to let Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher pass him, a move that proved to be unpopular among many Formula One fans and the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]], the sport's governing body.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/may/12/formulaone.theobserver|title=Barrichello gets pole in Austria|work=The Guardian|date=12 May 2002|access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/05/13/austria.ferrari/index.html|title=F1 summons Schumacher, Barrichello |date=13 May 2002|publisher=CNN|access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref> Following this incident and others in which team orders were used, such as [[McLaren]]'s use of them at the [[1997 European Grand Prix]] and at the [[1998 Australian Grand Prix]], and [[Jordan Grand Prix]]'s at the [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix]], team orders in Formula One were officially banned ahead of the [[2003 Formula One season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mclaren.com/formula1/team/11-pitstops-that-changed-the-face-of-a-race/|title=McLaren Formula 1 \u2013 11 pitstops that changed the face of a race|publisher=McLaren|access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/79515-spa-francorchamps-grand-prix-1998-the-greatest-f1-race-ever|title=Spa Francorchamps Grand Prix 1998: The Greatest F1 Race Ever?|author=Mary O'Shea|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>CNN.com \u2013 F1 teams are given orders warning \u2013 26 September 2003</ref>\n\nOn lap 49 of the [[2010 German Grand Prix]], Fernando Alonso went past Felipe Massa for the race lead, after Ferrari had informed Massa that Alonso was 'faster than him'.

Marlboro had already been Ferrari's minor sponsor since the {{F1|1984}} season and increased to the team's major sponsorship in the {{F1|1993}} season. Alongside [[Jordan Grand Prix]], the team was required to run non-tobacco liveries in [[United States Grand Prix]] in the 2000s due to United States [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]] requirements (Phillip Morris was sponsoring [[Team Penske]] at the time; federal law at the time allowed each tobacco company to sponsor only one sporting entity).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vadja |first1=Gabor |title=Ferrari, Jordan Sponsor Bumped by Penske at USGP, Firm Policies Itself |url=https://gaborvajda.kinja.com/ferrari-jordan-sponsor-bumped-by-penske-at-usgp-firm-1741585886 |access-date=16 May 2020}}</ref> In September 2005 Ferrari signed an extension of the arrangement until 2011 at a time when advertising of tobacco sponsorship had become illegal in the European Union and other major teams had withdrawn from relationships with tobacco companies (e.g., McLaren had ended its eight-year relationship with [[West (cigarette)|West]]). In reporting the deal, ''[[F1 Racing]]'' magazine judged it to be a 'black day' for the sport, putting non-tobacco funded teams at a disadvantage and discouraging other brands from entering a sport still associated with tobacco. The magazine estimated that between 2005 and 2011, Ferrari received $1&nbsp;billion from the agreement. The last time Ferrari ran explicit tobacco sponsorship on the car was in 2007 {{F1 GP|2007|Chinese}}, with barcodes and other subliminal markers used afterwards. On 8 July 2011, it was announced that the '[[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]]' section of its official team name had been removed from the [[2011 British Grand Prix]] onwards, following complaints from sponsorship regulators.<ref name=\"marlboro\">{{cite news|url=http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-ferrari-drops-marlboro-from-team-name/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301211309/http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-ferrari-drops-marlboro-from-team-name/|archive-date=1 March 2013|work=speedtv.com|publisher=[[Speed (TV channel)|Speed]]|date=8 July 2011|access-date=8 July 2011|title=Ferrari Drops Marlboro From Team Name|first=Adam|last=Cooper}}</ref> As a consequence, the official team's name was reverted to ''Scuderia Ferrari''.

Ferrari cars (including non-works entries) won the [[Mille Miglia]] 8 times, the [[Targa Florio]] 7 times, and the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] 9 times.\n\nFerrari scored early successes in sportscars, taking wins in 1950 and 1951 [[Mille Miglia]]. However, the 1951 victory resulted in lengthy litigation when Ascari crashed through a barrier and killed a local doctor.\n\nIn 1953, the [[World Sportscar Championship]] was established. Scuderia Ferrari, along with other manufacturers such as [[Aston Martin]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] began to enter multiple factory-backed cars in races such as the [[Le Mans 24 Hours]]. Ferrari launched a large range of sports racers over the next three years. This included the traditional compact ''Colombo'' V12-powered [[Ferrari 166 S|166 MM]] and [[Ferrari 250 MM|250 MM]]; the larger V12 ''Lampredi'' [[Ferrari 340 MM|340 MM]], [[Ferrari 375 MM|375 MM]], [[Ferrari 375 Plus|375 Plus]] and [[Ferrari 410 S|410 S]]; and ''Jano'' [[Ferrari 290 MM|290 MM]], [[Ferrari 315 S|315 S]] and [[Ferrari 335 S|335 S]]; the four-cylinder [[Ferrari Monza|500, 625, 750, and 860 Monzas]], and the six-cylinder [[Ferrari 376 S|376 S and 735 LM]]. With this potent line-up, Ferrari was able to claim six of the first seven WSC titles: 1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, and 1958.\n\nThis sportscar championship included road races such as the [[Carrera Panamericana]] in Mexico, [[Mille Miglia]] in Italy, and the Sicilian [[Targa Florio]]. Ferrari cars (including non-works entries) won the [[Mille Miglia]] eight times, the [[Targa Florio]] seven times, and the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] nine times, including six wins in a row from 1960 to 1965.\n\nThe 1970s was the last decade Ferrari entered as a works effort in [[sports car racing]]. With the introduction of the Sports Prototypes class, Ferrari developed the [[Ferrari P|P series]], but the 1970s were to be the last decade Ferrari entered as a works effort in sports car racing. After an uninspired performance in the 1973 F1 World Championship, Enzo Ferrari stopped all development of sports cars in prototype and GT racing at the end of the year to concentrate on Formula One.\n\nFerrari cars were raced in a range of classes such as GT Racing by other entrants, but not by the factory Scuderia Ferrari team. In the 1990s, Ferrari returned to Sports prototypes as a constructor with the [[Ferrari 333 SP|333SP]] with success, although Scuderia Ferrari itself never raced this car.\n\nIn the 2010s, Italy's [[AF Corse]] and United States' [[Risi Competizione]] have competed with factory support in the GTE Pro/GTLM class at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], [[European Le Mans Series]], [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], [[American Le Mans Series]] and [[IMSA SportsCar Championship]]. Notable Ferrari GT factory drivers include [[Giancarlo Fisichella]], [[Gianmaria Bruni]], [[Mika Salo]], [[Toni Vilander]], [[Olivier Beretta]], [[Kamui Kobayashi]], [[Jaime Melo]], [[James Calado]], [[Alessandro Pier Guidi]], [[Daniel Serra]] and [[Davide Rigon]].\n\nThe [[AF Corse]] won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the GTE Pro class four times: in 2012 and 2014 with the [[Ferrari 458 GT2]] driven by Bruni, Fisichella, and Vilander, in 2019 with the [[Ferrari 488 GTE]] driven by Pier Guidi, Calado and Serra, and in 2021 with the same car driven by Pier Guidi, Calado and [[C\u00f4me Ledogar]]. They also won the [[FIA WEC]] GT manufacturers World Championship in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017, and the FIA WEC GT Drivers' Championship in 2013, 2014 with Bruni and 2017 with Calado and Pier Guidi, the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] in 2011, the [[2011 Petit Le Mans]] GT class with Bruni, Fisichella and Kaffer and the [[2020 GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup]] with Pier Guidi.
