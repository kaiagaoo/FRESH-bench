The Knicks compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]] of the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]]. The team plays its home games at [[Madison Square Garden]], an arena they share with the [[New York Rangers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). They are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other team is the [[Brooklyn Nets]]. Alongside the [[Boston Celtics]], the Knicks are one of two original NBA teams still located in its original city.\n\nThe team, established by [[Ned Irish]] in 1946, was one of the founding members of the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA), which became the NBA [[National Basketball Association#Creation and BAA\u2013NBL merger (1946\u20131956)|after merging]] with the rival [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) in 1949. The Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the franchise's first head coach [[Joe Lapchick]]. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the [[NBA Finals]], all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter.\n\nIt was not until the late 1960s when [[Red Holzman]] became the head coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two NBA championships, in [[1969\u201370 NBA season|1970]] and [[1972\u201373 NBA season|1973]]. The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances; however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.\n\nThe playoff-level Knicks of the 1990s were led by future Hall of Fame center [[Patrick Ewing]]; this era was marked by passionate rivalries with the [[Bulls\u2013Knicks rivalry|Chicago Bulls]], [[Knicks\u2013Pacers rivalry|Indiana Pacers]], and [[Heat\u2013Knicks rivalry|Miami Heat]]. During this time, they were known for playing tough defense under head coaches [[Pat Riley]] and [[Jeff Van Gundy]], making NBA Finals appearances in [[1994 NBA Finals|1994]] and [[1999 NBA Finals|1999]]. However, they were unable to win an NBA championship during this era.\n\nSince 2000, the Knicks have struggled to regain their former successes, but won their first division title in 19 years in [[2012\u201313 New York Knicks season|2012\u201313]], led by a core of [[Forward (basketball position)|forwards]] [[Carmelo Anthony]] and [[Amar'e Stoudemire]]. They were eventually eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the [[Indiana Pacers]], and had failed to make the playoffs for eight years until [[2020\u201321 New York Knicks season|2020\u201321]] when they were led by forward [[Julius Randle]] and sophomore [[RJ Barrett]], who was selected third overall in the [[2019 NBA draft]].<ref>{{cite web |title=NBA playoff watch: Atlanta Hawks wrap up berth; Boston Celtics land in play-in |url=https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31381497/nba-playoff-watch-atlanta-hawks-wrap-berth-boston-celtics-land-play-in |website=ESPN.com |access-date=May 16, 2021 |date=May 13, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|List of New York Knicks seasons}}\n\n===1946\u20131967: early years===\nIn 1946, basketball, particularly [[college basketball]], was a growing and increasingly profitable sport in New York City.{{Sfn|Hahn|p=8}} [[Ice hockey|Hockey]] was another popular sport at the time and generated considerable profits; however, the arenas were not used often.{{Sfn|Schumacher|p=71}} [[Max Kase]], a New York sportswriter, became the sports editor at the ''[[Boston American]]'' in the 1930s, when he met [[Boston Garden]] owner [[Walter A.

After tallying the votes, the franchise was named the Knickerbockers.{{Sfn|Hahn|p=14}} The \"Knickerbocker\" name comes from the pseudonym used by [[Washington Irving]] in his book ''[[A History of New York]]'', a name that became applied to the descendants of the original [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers of what later became New York, and later, by extension, to New Yorkers in general.<ref name=\"Knickerbocker\"/> In search of a head coach, Irish approached successful [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's University]] coach [[Joe Lapchick]] in May 1946.{{Sfn|Hahn|p=14}} Lapchick readily accepted after Irish promised to make him the highest-paid coach in the league;

Before the season, the Knicks traded [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]] to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] for [[Charles Smith (basketball, born 1965)|Charles Smith]], [[Doc Rivers]], and [[Bo Kimble]] while also acquiring [[Rolando Blackman]] from the [[Dallas Mavericks]]. After defeating the [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Charlotte Hornets]] in the first two rounds of the [[1993 NBA playoffs|playoffs]], the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals, where once again they met the Bulls. After taking a 2\u20130 series lead, the Knicks lost the next four games.\n\nAfter the Bulls' [[Michael Jordan]] made what would be his first retirement from basketball prior to the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]], many saw this as an opportunity for the Knicks to finally make it to the NBA Finals. The team, who acquired [[Derek Harper]] in a midseason trade with the [[Dallas Mavericks]], once again won the Atlantic Division with a 57\u201325 record. In [[1994 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], the team played a then NBA-record 25 games (the [[Boston Celtics]] played 26 games in the [[2008 NBA playoffs|2008 playoffs]]); they started by defeating the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the first round before finally getting past the Bulls, defeating them in the second round in seven games. In the Eastern Conference Finals, they faced the [[Indiana Pacers]], who at one point held a three games-to-two lead. They had this advantage thanks to the exploits of [[Reggie Miller]], who scored 25 fourth-quarter points in Game 5 to lead the Pacers to victory. However, the Knicks won the next two games to reach their first NBA Finals since 1973.\n\nIn [[1994 NBA Finals|the finals]], the Knicks would play seven low-scoring, defensive games against the [[Houston Rockets]]. After splitting the first two games in Houston, the Knicks would win two out of three games at [[Madison Square Garden]], which also hosted the [[New York Rangers]] [[Curse of 1940|first Stanley Cup celebration in 54 years]] following their win over the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in Game 7 of [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|their finals]] during the series. (A Knicks win would have made the Garden the first building to host a Cup winner and an NBA champ in the same season.) In Game 6, however, a last-second attempt at a game-winning shot by Starks was tipped by Rockets center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], giving the Rockets an 86\u201384 victory and forcing a Game 7. The Knicks lost Game 7 90\u201384, credited in large part to Starks's dismal 2-for-18 shooting performance and Riley's stubborn refusal to bench Starks, despite having bench players who were renowned for their shooting prowess, such as [[Rolando Blackman]] and [[Hubert Davis]] available. The loss denied New York the distinction of having both NBA and NHL championships in the same year. Nevertheless, the Knicks had gotten some inspiration from [[Mark Messier]] and the Rangers during the finals.\n\nThe next year, the Knicks were second place in the Atlantic Division with a 55\u201327 record. The team defeated the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] before facing the Pacers again in the second round. The tone for the Knicks\u2013Pacers series was set in Game 1, as Miller once again became a clutch nuisance to the Knicks by scoring eight points in the final 8 seconds of the game to give the Pacers a 107\u2013105 victory. The series went to a Game 7, and when [[Patrick Ewing]]'s last-second [[finger roll]] attempt to tie the game missed, the Pacers clinched the 97\u201395 win. Riley resigned the next day,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1995-06-16/sports/17963501_1_dave-checketts-knicks-pat-riley |title=Daily News America \u2013 Breaking national news, video, and photos \u2013 Homepage|work=New York Daily News |access-date=July 1, 2013}}</ref> and the Knicks hired [[Don Nelson]] as their new head coach.\n\nHowever Nelson's uptempo approach clashed with the Knicks' defensive identity, and during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]], Nelson was fired after 59 games, and, instead of going after another well-known coach, the Knicks hired longtime assistant [[Jeff Van Gundy]], who had no prior experience as a head coach. The Knicks ended up with a 47\u201335 record that year, and swept the Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs before losing to the eventual champion Bulls (who had an NBA record 72 wins in the regular season) in five games.\n\n====1996\u20132000: the Jeff Van Gundy years====\nIn the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], the Knicks, with the additions of such players as [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] and [[Allan Houston]], registered a 57\u201325 record. In the playoffs, the Knicks swept the [[Charlotte Hornets]] in the first round before facing the [[Miami Heat]] (coached by Riley) in the second round. The Knicks took a 3\u20131 lead in the series before a brawl near the end of Game 5 resulted in suspensions of key players. Many of the suspended Knicks players, Ewing in particular, were disciplined not for participating in the altercation itself, but for violating an NBA rule stipulating that a benched player may not leave the bench during a fight (the rule was subsequently amended, making it illegal to leave the \"bench area\"). With Ewing and Houston suspended for Game 6, Johnson and Starks suspended for Game 7, and [[Charlie Ward]] suspended for both, the Knicks lost the series.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]] was marred by a wrist injury to Ewing on December 22, which forced him to miss the rest of the season and much of the playoffs. The team, which had a 43\u201339 record that season, still managed to defeat the Heat in the first round (a series, which saw another violent bench-clearing brawl at the end of Game 4, this time between Johnson and former Hornets teammate [[Alonzo Mourning]]) of the playoffs before having another meeting with the Pacers in the second round. Ewing returned in time for game two of the series. This time, the Pacers easily won the series in five games, as [[Reggie Miller]] once again broke the hearts of Knicks fans by hitting a tying three-pointer with 5.1 seconds remaining in Game 4, en route to a Pacers overtime victory. For the fourth straight year, the Knicks were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nPrior to the lockout-shortened [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]], the Knicks traded [[Charles Oakley]] to the [[Toronto Raptors]] for [[Marcus Camby]] while also trading [[John Starks (basketball)|John Starks]] in a package to the [[Golden State Warriors]] for 1994's 1st team all-league shooting guard [[Latrell Sprewell]] (whose contract was voided by the Warriors after choking Warriors' head coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]] during the previous season). After barely getting into the playoffs with a 27\u201323 record, the Knicks started a [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella]] run. It started with the Knicks eliminating the #1 seeded Heat in the first round after [[Allan Houston]] bounced in a running one-hander off the front of the rim, high off the backboard, and in with 0.8 seconds left in the deciding 5th game. This remarkable upset marked only the second time in NBA history that an 8-seed had defeated the 1-seed in the NBA playoffs, and also the first time it happened in the Eastern Conference. After defeating the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in the second round four games to none, they faced the Pacers yet again in the Eastern Conference Finals. Despite losing Ewing to injury for the rest of the playoffs prior to Game 3, the Knicks won the series (aided in part to a four-point play by Larry Johnson in the final seconds of Game 3) to become the first eighth-seeded playoff team to make it to the NBA Finals. However, in the Finals, the [[San Antonio Spurs]], with superstars [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] and [[Tim Duncan]], proved too much for the injury-laden Knicks, who lost in five games. The remarkable fifth game of this Finals is remembered for its 2nd half scoring duel between the Spurs' [[Tim Duncan]] and the Knicks' [[Latrell Sprewell]], and was decided by a long jumper by [[Avery Johnson]] with 47 seconds left to clinch the title for the Spurs.\n\nThe [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], would prove to be the last one in New York for Ewing, as the Knicks, who had a 50\u201332 record that season swept the [[Toronto Raptors]] a team led by [[Vince Carter]], [[Antonio Davis]] and a young [[Tracy McGrady]] in three games in the first round, defeated the [[Miami Heat]] in another dramatic seven-game series in which Ewing's dunk with over a minute remaining in game 7, provided the winning margin in a 1-point road victory. They would, however, lose in the Eastern Conference Finals to the [[Reggie Miller]]-led [[Indiana Pacers]] in six games. After the season, Ewing was traded<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/09/21/spt_ewing_traded_to.html |title=Ewing traded to Sonics in four-team deal |publisher=Enquirer.com |date=September 21, 2000 |access-date=July 1, 2013}}</ref> on September 20, 2000, to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], and the Ewing era, which produced many successful playoff appearances but no NBA championship titles, came to an end.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Getting It Done|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/2000/09/20/ewing_trade_ap/|magazine=Sports Illustrated|agency=Associated Press|date=September 21, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627084739/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/2000/09/20/ewing_trade_ap/|archive-date=June 27, 2012|access-date=January 13, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132003: downfall===\n[[File:Madison Square Garden (MSG) - Full (48124330357).jpg|right|thumb|250px|The current [[Madison Square Garden]] has been the home of the Knicks since 1968.]]\nDespite the loss of Ewing, the Knicks remained successful in the regular season, as they posted a 48\u201334 record under the direction of Houston and Sprewell.<ref>{{cite web|title=2000\u201301 New York Knicks Roster and Statistics|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2001.html|publisher=Basketball Reference|access-date=July 4, 2011}}</ref> In the first round of playoff contention, however, New York fell to the [[Toronto Raptors]] in five games, failing to get past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in a decade.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Knicks knocked out|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/2001/playoffs/news/2001/05/04/knicks_side_ap/|magazine=Sports Illustrated|agency=Associated Press|date=May 4, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104171028/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/2001/playoffs/news/2001/05/04/knicks_side_ap/|archive-date=November 4, 2012|access-date=July 4, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a poor start to [[2001\u201302 New York Knicks season|the season]], the Knicks managed to get above .500 with a 10\u20139 record.<ref name=\"Resignation and Decline\">{{cite web|title=2001\u201302 New York Knicks Schedule and Results|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2002_games.html|publisher=Basketball Reference|access-date=July 4, 2011}}</ref> In spite of their recent success, Van Gundy unexpectedly resigned<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/news/2001/12/08/vangundy_quits_ap |title=Out in a New York minute |access-date=November 9, 2012 |archive-date=May 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508023303/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/news/2001/12/08/vangundy_quits_ap/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> as head coach on December 8, 2001, explaining he had \"lost focus\" and would no longer be able to properly coach the team.<ref>{{cite news|title=Van Gundy quits;

It was designed by [[New York World-Telegram]] cartoonist Willard Mullin.<ref name=\"Knickerbocker\" /> From the beginning, the Knicks home uniforms are in white with blue and orange trim, while the away uniforms are in blue with orange and white trim. The first iterations contain monotone lettering in blue (home) and orange (away) lettering, with the addition of a checkerboard pattern during the mid-1950s.\n\n===1964\u20131992: the Classic roundball era===\nThe Knicks would introduce an iconic logo that would endure for the next three decades. Designed by Bud Freeman, the word \"Knicks\" superimposed over a brown basketball is known as the \"classic roundball logo\", with minor changes throughout its lifespan such as maroon wordmark and orange basketball.<ref name=\"Knickerbocker\"/> An alternate logo featuring the full team name inside an orange basketball was used during the late 1960s and into the 1970s. As the 1960s began, the Knicks updated their uniforms again. This time the lettering is in serifed fonts, and the blue lettering and numbers on the home uniforms are now trimmed in orange. The away uniforms maintained the orange lettering but added white trim; it later changed to white letters while adding white trim on the piping. Side stripes were also added to the uniform. The \"NY\" monogram is on the left leg of the shorts.\n\n====1968\u20131979; 1983\u20131997: championship era uniforms====\nThe Knicks unveiled a uniform that would stay for three decades. This uniform, with an arched \"NEW YORK\" in serif lettering and in orange, would be the uniform worn during their 1970 and 1973 championship seasons; however, they were not introduced simultaneously. The home uniforms would debut in 1968, while the away uniforms debuted the following year. One noticeable feature was that the player's name was in a straight block arched lettering (which is also called the \"vertical arch\" style), which was meticulously designed by [[Gerry Cosby]] and his sporting goods company. The unusual arrangement on the player's name was later adopted by several [[Major League Baseball]] teams in the 1970s, and are currently used by the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Colorado Avalanche]], [[Detroit Red Wings]] and [[New York Rangers]]. On the shorts, there was no logo placed during much of the 1970s, but during the 1978\u201379 season, the side stripes were eliminated and the interlocking \"NY\" logo inside an apple was placed instead. When this uniform style was reinstated for the [[1983\u201384 New York Knicks season|1983\u201384 season]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/17/sports/sports-world-specials-233633.html \"Sports World Specials,\" ''The New York Times'', Monday, October 17, 1983.] Retrieved December 20, 2023.</ref> it now featured the player's number and the interlocking \"NY\" logo, in addition to the return of the side stripes. The shorts number was eliminated in 1987, while variations of the \"roundball logo\" replaced the \"NY\" logo from 1991 to 1997. Since the 1991\u201392 season various outfitters such as [[Champion (sportswear)|Champion]], [[Puma SE|Puma]], [[Reebok]], [[Adidas]], and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] have taken over uniform production from Cosby, with player names on the back reverted to a radial arch and added serifs.\n\n====1979\u20131983: crimson red era uniforms====\nThe Knicks radically changed their uniforms prior to the [[1979\u201380 New York Knicks season|1979\u201380 season]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/20/archives/sports-world-specials-more-colorful-knicks.html \"Sports World Specials,\" ''The New York Times'', Monday, August 20, 1979.] Retrieved December 20, 2023.</ref> Royal blue and orange were replaced by navy and [[Crimson|crimson red]]. During this period, the home uniforms featured the team name below the number, both in crimson red with navy trim and in a stylized, free-flowing font. Navy away uniforms continue to feature the city name but below the white and crimson red number. The interlocking \"NY\" logo debuted on the shorts, with the addition of player numbers and side stripes during the 1981\u201382 season.\n\nThe change to crimson red and navy was initiated by then-team president [[E. Michael Burke]], whose alma mater [[University of Pennsylvania]] wore those colors.\n\nThe \"Knicks\" script from the \"crimson red era\" uniforms was later reused in the uniforms of the Knicks' [[NBA Development League]] affiliate [[Westchester Knicks]], with the same team name below the number format.\n\n===1992\u20132012: new look era===\nBefore the 1992\u201393 season, the Knicks updated their \"roundball logo\" to its present form, with the word \"Knicks\" in a futuristic font, again superimposed over a basketball, with a silver triangle accentuating the look. The \"new look\" logo was designed by Tom O'Grady.<ref name=\"Knickerbocker\" /> For the 1995\u201396 season, the city name in a futuristic script was added atop the logo, while an alternate \"subway token\" logo featuring the acronym \"NYK\" was introduced. Black was also introduced as an accent color. The logo was added while the \"championship era\" uniforms were still in use, but during the 1995\u201396 season, the Knicks unveiled a blue alternate uniform, this time featuring black side stripes and the aforementioned \"subway token\" logo on the shorts' beltline. A home white version of this uniform was introduced for the 1997\u201398 season, effectively retiring the championship era uniforms. In the 2001\u201302 season, the side stripes were narrowed, while the \"subway token\" logo was moved to the back of the uniform, and the Knicks primary logo moved from the side to the front of the shorts.\n\n===2012\u2013present: modern era===\nThe Knicks updated their \"new look logo\", this time eliminating the color black from the scheme. They still used the previous uniform during the 2011\u201312 season, but for the 2012\u201313 season, the Knicks unveiled new uniforms inspired from their \"championship era\" uniforms. A more subtle and bolder \"New York\" script was introduced, while the uniform piping stopped until the lettering. The phrase ''Once A Knick, Always A Knick'' is added on the uniform collar. Gray became the accent color. In addition, an updated version of their 1970s secondary logo, this time featuring only the team name, was introduced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beck|first=Howard|title=Knicks Play Up Their 'New' Uniforms|url=http://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/knicks-play-up-their-new-uniforms/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 6, 2012|access-date=August 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2013, the Knicks unveiled an alternate orange uniform, which is essentially a mirror image of the blue away uniforms, but with orange as the primary color and blue and white as trim colors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Matt|title=Knicks unveil orange jerseys|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24137818/knicks-unveil-orange-jerseys|work=[[CBS Sports]]|date=October 25, 2013|access-date=August 31, 2015}}</ref> The uniforms debuted on October 31 in a road game against the Chicago Bulls, and were used in the first five weekend home games, but after going 0\u20136 in the orange uniforms, they were discontinued permanently.\n\nBeginning with the 2017\u201318 season, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] became the NBA's new uniform provider.<ref>[https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/13053413/nba-signs-8-year-apparel-deal-nike NBA signs deal with Nike; logo to appear on uniforms Jun 10, 2015] by Darren Rovell on ESPN</ref><ref>[https://news.sportslogos.net/2015/06/10/starting-in-2017-18-nike-will-be-uniform-supplier-of-nba/basketball/ Starting in 2017-18, Nike will be uniform supplier of NBA] on Sports Logos, June 10, 2015</ref> Under Nike, \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations were eliminated, and in their place were the white \"Association\" set, primary color \"Icon\" set, alternate color \"Statement\" set, and annual \"City\" set that were used either at home or away.<ref>[https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bulls/ct-nba-uniforms-nike-20170718-story.html Wardrobe change: No home, road uniforms as NBA goes to Nike] By BRIAN MAHONEY on ''The Chicago Tribune'' - JUL 18, 2017</ref><ref>[https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/18/15990700/nba-nike-uniforms-home-away-sports-apparel-deal The NBA is ditching traditional 'home and away' uniforms] By Michael D.

The uniforms during Noche Latina were originally white with blue and orange trim, first using the 2001\u201312 uniform from 2008 to 2012, and then the current uniforms from 2012 to 2015, the only exception being ''Nueva York'' in front. In the 2015\u201316 season, the Knicks used a variation of their away blue uniform for Noche Latina. The Saint Patrick's Day uniforms used the road uniform template except for green substituting for the blue base. These uniforms have also been used on [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|Christmas Day]] from the 2009\u201310 season, and was worn in particular by [[Nate Robinson]] for a \"Kryptonate vs. Superman\" theme against Dwight Howard in the [[2009 NBA All-Star Game#Slam Dunk Contest|2009 Slam Dunk Contest]]. The St. Patrick's uniforms were shelved after the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2012, the Knicks wore monochrome uniforms known as \"big color\". The uniforms are mostly orange, with blue trimming. The following year, the Knicks wore sleeved orange uniforms known as \"big logo\", featuring a chrome-treated Knicks logo in front. For the 2014 edition, the Knicks wore a variation of their home uniforms, featuring the team logo in front and the player's first name in a blue nameplate below the number. The 2016 Christmas Day game against the Celtics saw the Knicks wear an all-blue uniform without additional striping, complete with fancy scripted orange lettering and numbers.\n\nAs part of its deal with Nike, a special \"city\" uniform would be used to pay tribute to either local culture or team traditions. The Knicks' 2017\u201318 \"city\" uniform, which is navy with orange and grey trim and features an emblem containing the team name, uniform number, a ladder with a silhouette of a firefighter, a fire hydrant, and the abbreviation \"N.Y.C.\" for New York City, pays homage to the city's firefighters and their families. It was designed in collaboration with the Knicks, the NBA, Nike and the [[Uniformed Firefighters Association]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Knicks Unveil City Edition Uniforms Paying Homage to Firefighters & Their Families|url=http://www.nba.com/knicks/knicks-unveil-city-edition-uniforms-paying-homage-firefighters-their-families|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NYKnicks.com|access-date=January 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Knicks' second \"city\" uniform is also in navy and features white lettering, a straight aligned \"New York\" wordmark in front and alternating stripes of blue, navy and orange designed to mimic the New York City skyline. The blue and orange arm striping was inspired from the team's 1950s uniforms.

The \"NYC\" acronym in black and white trim is placed within the Nike mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=2020-21 NEW YORK KNICKS CITY EDITION UNIFORM|url=https://www.uniswag.com/blog/2020-21-new-york-knicks-city-edition-uniform|publisher=UniSwag|website=Uniswag.com|date=December 15, 2020|access-date=December 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Knicks' 2021\u201322 \"city\" uniform featured another collaboration with Kith. The predominantly black uniform featured the classic \"New York\" wordmark in white with orange trim, and orange numbers with white trim. Those elements, along with the 1992 \"New Look\" logo on the waist, paid tribute to the 1995\u20132001 blue uniforms. Along the side, black and gray checkerboard stripes were an homage to the 1950s set. A silhouette of the classic Madison Square Garden logo was added to the side stripes on the shorts.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ricky O'Donnell|title=Every NBA City Edition jersey for 2021-2022, ranked|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2021/11/1/22757301/nba-city-edition-jerseys-2021-2022-every-uniform-best-worst|publisher=SB Nation|date=November 1, 2021|access-date=November 3, 2021}}</ref>\n\nAnother Kith-collaborated \"city\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season. This design was inspired by the blue uniforms they wore from 1995 to 2001, but with black as the base color.<ref>{{cite web|title=New York Knicks 22/23 City Edition Uniform: Bridging the Gap|url=https://www.nba.com/news/new-york-knicks-city-edition|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=November 10, 2022|access-date=November 14, 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform, again under a collaboration with Kith, was yet another nod to the late 1990s\u2013early 2000s uniform design. In a first for the franchise, dark blue pinstripes were added to the blue-based uniform, and two \"New York\" wordmarks in both white and orange were layered twice on the top, in a nod to the iconic saying \u201cthe city so nice, they named it twice.\u201d Black and orange side stripes were also featured.<ref>{{cite web|title=New York Knicks 2023-24 City Edition Uniform: Ode To 90s and 2000s|url=https://www.nba.com/news/new-york-knicks-2023-24-city-edition-uniform-ode-to-90s-and-2000s|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=November 2, 2023|access-date=November 2, 2023}}</ref>\n\n===Throwback uniforms===\nThe Knicks were one of several NBA teams to wear throwback uniforms during the league's 50th anniversary in the 1996\u201397 season. The throwback set they wore that season represented the franchise's first season in 1946\u201347. However, both the blue and white throwbacks featured blue letters with orange trim (the originals had only orange letters on the blue uniform and blue letters on the white uniform minus any additional trim).\n\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, the Knicks wore throwback white uniforms from the \"maroon era\" of the early 1980s. The only difference from the originals was that the letters on the player's name were arranged in a radial arch (the originals were designed in a vertical arch) and were smaller in size.\n\nThe following season, the Knicks wore throwback blue checkerboard uniforms from the mid-1950s, which featured the \"Father Knickerbocker\" logo on the left leg (the originals did not feature said logo).\n\nFor the 2007\u201308 season, the Knicks wore their classic white uniforms as a tribute to the early 1970s championship teams. As with the \"maroon era\" throwbacks, the player's name no longer appeared in a vertical arch and were smaller in size. In addition, the original \"roundball\" logo was added (the original uniforms had no logo on the shorts).\n\nThe 2010\u201311 season saw the Knicks wear the blue uniforms to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the 1969\u201370 championship team. However, the design they wore that season faithfully replicated those of the 1991\u201392 Knicks team, complete with radially-arched serifed block letters on the player's name and the \"roundball\" logo on the shorts. In the original version, the shorts had no logo while the player name is arranged in a vertical arch and in a sans-serif block font.\n\nIn the 2015\u201316 season, the Knicks wore throwback white versions of the mid-1950s checkerboard uniforms in commemoration of the franchise's 70th season.\n\nIn the 2021\u201322 season, the Knicks, along with the Celtics and Warriors, were one of three teams to wear a \"classic edition\" uniform to commemorate each franchise and the NBA's 75th anniversary. The Knicks design harkened back to the original white uniforms from 1946, complete with enlarged blue numbers, blue waistbands, and blue and orange side stripes.\n\n==Players==\n\n===Current roster===\n{{New York Knicks roster}}\n\n===Retained draft rights===\nThe Knicks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm|title=NBA Salary Cap FAQ \u2013 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement|quote=If the player is already under contract to, or signs a contract with a non-NBA team, the team retains the player's draft rights for one year after the player's obligation to the non-NBA team ends.

The rivalry stems from the old rivalry between the cities of New York City and [[Boston]], which is also mirrored in both the [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|Yankees\u2013Red Sox]] and [[Jets\u2013Patriots rivalry|Jets\u2013Patriots]] rivalries. The fact that Boston and New York City are only 190 miles apart contributes to it.\n\nThe teams have met nine times in the postseason. The last time was in the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]], when [[Carmelo Anthony]] won the 2013 scoring title and helped them win the Atlantic Division for the first time since 1994. The Knicks faced the Celtics, who were without [[Rajon Rondo]] because of a mid-season injury, in the 1st round of the [[2013 NBA playoffs|2013 playoffs]]. In both games 1 and 2, Celtics had a lead going into halftime but were held to 25 and 23 points respectively in the second half, which was an all-time low for the franchise in the playoffs. Knicks gained a 3\u20130 lead in the series, but Boston avoided elimination in games 4 and 5. In game six, Knicks once led by 26 points in the fourth quarter, then the Celtics went onto a 20\u20130 run in less than 5 minutes to make it a close game, but Knicks still won and moved on to round 2.\n\n===Brooklyn Nets===\n{{Main|Knicks\u2013Nets rivalry}}\nThe [[Brooklyn Nets]], formerly the New Jersey Nets, are the Knicks' closest rival geographically. Both teams play in New York City, with the Knicks in [[Manhattan]] and the Nets in [[Brooklyn]]. Media outlets have noted the Knicks-Nets rivalry's similarity to those of other New York City teams, such as [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Subway Series]] rivalry between the [[American League]]'s [[New York Yankees]] ([[the Bronx]]) and the [[National League (baseball)|National League]]'s [[New York Mets]] ([[Queens]]), due to both boroughs' proximity through the [[New York City Subway]]. Historically, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn competed via the [[Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry]], when the two teams were known as the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]. Like the Knicks and Nets, the Giants and Dodgers played in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively, and were fierce divisional rivals.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/sports/basketball/knicks-nets-will-turn-into-a-rivalry-to-join-new-yorks-rich-past.html | work=The New York Times | title=A Rivalry to Add to the City's Rich History | first=George | last=Vecsey | date=November 25, 2012 }}</ref> The [[Islanders\u2013Rangers rivalry|rivalry]] between the [[New York Islanders]] and [[New York Rangers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] also had this distinction when the Islanders played in Brooklyn from 2015 to 2020.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://fort-greene.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/islanders-fans-react-to-barclays-center-move/ | work=The New York Times | title=Islanders Fans React to Barclays Center Move | first=Chris | last=Dell | date=October 31, 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104113253/http://fort-greene.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/islanders-fans-react-to-barclays-center-move/ | archive-date=January 4, 2013 }}</ref> Due to the Knicks and Nets being located in the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, some media outlets have dubbed this rivalry \"Clash of the Boroughs\".<ref name=\"clashofboros\">{{cite web|title=Clash of the Boroughs Resounds in Brooklyn|url=http://www.nba.com/nets/viewfromcouch/clash-boroughs-resounds-brooklyn|publisher=BrooklynNets.com|access-date=November 26, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130129160633/http://www.nba.com/nets/viewfromcouch/clash-boroughs-resounds-brooklyn|archive-date=January 29, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Knicks and Nets have met in the playoffs three times, with the Knicks winning two of the three meetings. The Knicks defeated the Nets in the playoffs in [[1983 NBA playoffs|1983]] and [[1994 NBA playoffs|1994]], while the Nets won their most recent meeting in [[2004 NBA playoffs|2004]].\n\n===Chicago Bulls===\n{{Main|Knicks\u2013Bulls rivalry}}\nThe Knicks have a strong rivalry with the [[Chicago Bulls]]. The rivalry's most intense period was during the late 1980s and early 90s, when both teams were huge playoff contenders. This intensity was due to a variety of factors: the great frequency in which the teams competed against each other in high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such as [[Michael Jordan]], [[Scottie Pippen]], [[Patrick Ewing]], and [[John Starks (basketball)|John Starks]]; the reputations of the team's respective cities; and personnel changes and conflicts between the teams.\n\nThe rivalry was dormant through much of the 2000s, with both teams rebuilding after the retirements of [[Patrick Ewing]] and [[Michael Jordan]]. However, with the arrival of future NBA MVP [[Derrick Rose]] in 2008, the Chicago Bulls began experiencing success once again. In the summer of 2010, the Bulls signed [[Carlos Boozer]] and the Knicks signed [[Amar'e Stoudemire]], making both teams playoff contenders once again. [[Carmelo Anthony]] and [[Tyson Chandler]] joined the Knicks soon after, and the rivalry between the two teams appears to have been reborn.\n\n===Indiana Pacers===\n{{Main|Knicks\u2013Pacers rivalry}}\nThe rivalry between the New York Knicks and the [[Indiana Pacers]] started in 1993 and quickly became one of the most bitter in NBA history. They met in the playoffs 6 times from 1993 to 2000, fueling a rivalry epitomized by the enmity between [[Reggie Miller]] and prominent Knick fan [[Spike Lee]]. Miller likened it to the [[Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud]], and [[The New York Times]] said in 1998 that it was \"as combustible as any in the league\".\nThe rivalry gave Miller the nickname \"The Knick-Killer\". His clutch performances were frequently followed by jabs at Lee like the choke sign, adding fuel to the rivalry. The rivalry renewed during the [[2013 NBA playoffs]] in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with Indiana taking the series 4 games to 2.\n\n===Miami Heat===\n{{Main|Knicks\u2013Heat rivalry}}\nThe Miami Heat were one of the New York Knicks' strongest inter-divisional foes. The two teams met in the playoffs each year from 1997 to 2000, with all four of those series being played to the maximum number of games. [[Pat Riley]], the head coach of the Miami Heat at the time, served as the head coach of the Knicks from 1991 to 1995 and led the Knicks to the [[1994 NBA Finals]]. During this four-year span, the Heat and the Knicks each won two playoff series against each other.\n\nThe two teams met again in the first round of the [[2012 NBA playoffs]], for the first time since the 1990s rivalry days. The Heat won the series, 4\u20131, and later went on to win the [[2012 NBA Finals]].\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==General and cited references==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Benson\n | first = Michael\n | year = 2007\n | title = Everything You Wanted to Know About the New York Knicks: A Who's Who of Everyone Who Ever Played on or Coached the NBA's Most Celebrated Team\n | edition = First\n | publisher = Taylor Trade Publishing\n | location = Lanham, Maryland\n | isbn = 978-1-58979-374-3\n | ref = {{SfnRef|Benson}}\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Hahn\n | first = Alan\n | year = 2012\n | title = New York Knicks: The Complete Illustrated History\n | edition = First\n | publisher = MVP Books\n | location = Minneapolis\n | isbn = 978-0-7603-4331-9\n | ref = {{SfnRef|Hahn}}\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Schumacher\n | first = Michael\n | year = 2008\n | title = Mr. Basketball: George Mikan, the Minneapolis Lakers, and the Birth of the NBA\n | edition = Reprint\n | publisher = University of Minnesota Press\n | location = Minneapolis\n | isbn = 978-0-8166-5675-2\n | ref = {{SfnRef|Schumacher}}\n }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|New York Knicks}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{New York Knicks}}\n{{Navboxes|titlestyle = {{NBA color cell|New York Knicks|border=2}}|list =\n{{New York Knicks seasons}}\n{{Madison Square Garden Company}}\n{{NBA}}\n{{NewYorksports}}\n{{New York Sports}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|Basketball|New York City|New York (state)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:New York Knicks| ]]\n[[Category:1946 establishments in New York City]]\n[[Category:Basketball teams established in 1946]]\n[[Category:Basketball teams in New York City|Knicks]]\n[[Category:Madison Square Garden Sports]]\n[[Category:Gulf and Western Industries]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association teams]]"}
