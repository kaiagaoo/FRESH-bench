The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.<ref>Hamil (2008), p. 124.</ref> The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities \u2013 the value of which is driven by television exposure.<ref>Hamil (2008), p. 121.</ref> During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Beckham fever grips Japan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2999514.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=18 June 2003 |access-date=20 June 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBecause higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club.
