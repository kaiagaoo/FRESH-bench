After the war, the club received compensation from the [[War Damage Commission]] in the amount of \u00a322,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its \"home\" games at Manchester City's [[Maine Road]] ground; Manchester United was charged \u00a35,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.<ref>White, John (2007), p. 11.</ref> Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a [[cantilever]]ed structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the [[1993\u201394 Manchester United F.C. season|1993\u201394 season]].<ref name=\"barnes_19\"/> First used on 25 March 1957 and costing \u00a340,000, four {{convert|180|ft|m|adj=on}} pylons were erected, each housing 54&nbsp;individual floodlights.

In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998\u201399 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants.

The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded \"[[catenaccio]]\" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) \"captured the imagination of the English footballing public\".<ref name=\"hamil_116\">Hamil (2008), p. 116.</ref> Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the \"[[Fifth Beatle]]\" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.<ref name=\"hamil_116\"/>\n\nAs the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.<ref>Hamil (2008), p. 124.</ref> The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities \u2013 the value of which is driven by television exposure.<ref>Hamil (2008), p. 121.</ref> During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Beckham fever grips Japan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2999514.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=18 June 2003 |access-date=20 June 2010 |archive-date=11 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511095439/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2999514.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nBecause higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the [[BSkyB]] broadcasting deal.<ref>Hamil (2008), p. 120.</ref> Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005\u201306, the club's commercial arm generated \u00a351&nbsp;million, compared to \u00a342.5&nbsp;million at Chelsea, \u00a339.3&nbsp;million at Liverpool, \u00a334&nbsp;million at Arsenal and \u00a327.9&nbsp;million at Newcastle United.

Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services \u2013 such as the club's dedicated television channel, [[MUTV (Manchester United F.C.)|MUTV]] \u2013 have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.<ref name=\"hamil_126\"/>\n\n===Sponsorship===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Period\n!scope=\"col\"| Kit manufacturer\n!scope=\"col\"| Shirt sponsor (chest)\n!scope=\"col\"| Shirt sponsor (sleeve)\n|-\n|1945\u20131975\n|[[Umbro]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"| \u2014\n|rowspan=\"11\"| \u2014\n|-\n|1975\u20131980\n|[[Admiral Sportswear|Admiral]]\n|-\n|1980\u20131982\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Adidas]]\n|-\n|1982\u20131992\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Sharp Corporation|Sharp Electronics]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Spencer |first=Jamie |date=2021-03-08 |title=Man Utd in talks over new \u00a370m a season shirt sponsor |url=https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-in-70m-a-season-talks-over-new-shirt-sponsor |access-date=2023-03-12 |website=90min.com |language=en-GB |archive-date=12 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230312212828/https://www.90min.com/posts/man-utd-in-70m-a-season-talks-over-new-shirt-sponsor |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n|1992\u20132000\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Umbro]]\n|-\n|2000\u20132002\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Vodafone]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n|2002\u20132006\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]\n|-\n|2006\u20132010\n|[[American International Group|AIG]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n|2010\u20132014\n|[[Aon (company)|Aon]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n|2014\u20132015\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Chevrolet]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n|2015\u20132018\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Adidas]]\n|-\n|2018\u20132021\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Kohler Co.|Kohler]]\n|-\n|2021\u20132022\n|rowspan=2|[[TeamViewer]]\n|-\n|2022\u2013\n|[[DXC Technology]]\n|}\nIn an initial five-year deal worth \u00a3500,000, [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp Electronics]] became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982\u201383 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999\u20132000 season, when [[Vodafone]] agreed a four-year, \u00a330&nbsp;million deal.<ref name=\"shirt_sponsorship\">{{cite news |first=James |last=Ducker |title=Manchester United show financial muscle after signing record \u00a380m shirt contract |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article6426463.ece |work=The Times |location=London |date=4 June 2009 |access-date=9 July 2010 |archive-date=1 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201172528/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article6426463.ece |url-status=live }}</ref> Vodafone agreed to pay \u00a336&nbsp;million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.<ref name=\"shirt_sponsorship\"/>\n\nTo commence at the start of the 2006\u201307 season, American insurance corporation [[American International Group|AIG]] agreed a four-year \u00a356.5&nbsp;million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oilinvest to renegotiate Juventus sponsorship |url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/oilinvest-renegotiate-juventus-sponsorship |publisher=SportBusiness (SBG Companies) |date=7 September 2006 |access-date=28 May 2007 |url-access=subscription |archive-date=24 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924110250/http://www.sportbusiness.com/oilinvest-renegotiate-juventus-sponsorship |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd sign \u00a356m AIG shirt deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4882640.stm |work=BBC News |date=6 April 2006 |access-date=24 June 2010 |archive-date=18 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518155937/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4882640.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> At the beginning of the 2010\u201311 season, American reinsurance company [[Aon plc|Aon]] became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately \u00a380&nbsp;million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Ben |last1=Smith |first2=James |last2=Ducker |title=Manchester United announce \u00a380&nbsp;million sponsorship deal with Aon |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article6422090.ece |work=The Times |location=London |date=3 June 2009 |access-date=9 July 2010 |archive-date=1 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201172528/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article6422090.ece |url-status=live }}</ref> Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with [[DHL Express|DHL]] reported to be worth \u00a340&nbsp;million;
