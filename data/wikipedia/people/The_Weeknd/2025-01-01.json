After co-founding the record label [[XO (record label)|XO]], he released three mixtapes\u2014''[[House of Balloons]]'', ''[[Thursday (album)|Thursday]]'', and ''[[Echoes of Silence]]''\u2014in 2011, and gained recognition for his blend of [[contemporary R&B|contemporary]] and [[alternative R&B]], as well as the mystery surrounding his identity. He signed with [[Republic Records]] to reissue the mixtapes into the compilation album ''[[Trilogy (The Weeknd album)|Trilogy]]'' (2012), and release his debut studio album, ''[[Kiss Land]]'' (2013) the following year. After a string of collaborations and film soundtrack contributions from 2013 and 2014, Tesfaye transitioned from alternative R&B to a [[pop music|pop]] sound with his second and third studio albums, ''[[Beauty Behind the Madness]]'' (2015) and ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]'' (2016), both of which debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The former yielded his first two US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles, \"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\" and \"[[The Hills (song)|The Hills]]\", while ''Starboy'' spawned two more: its [[Starboy (song)|title track]] (featuring [[Daft Punk]]), and after a 2023 remix with [[Ariana Grande]], \"[[Die for You (The Weeknd song)|Die for You]]\".\n\nHe returned to alternative R&B for his debut [[extended play]], ''[[My Dear Melancholy]]'' (2018), which included the US top-ten single \"[[Call Out My Name]]\". He explored the [[dream-pop]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] genres with his fourth studio album, ''[[After Hours (The Weeknd album)|After Hours]]'' (2020), which spawned the record-setting single, \"[[Blinding Lights]]\", in which became the [[List of Spotify streaming records|most-streamed song of all time on Spotify]], broke records as the longest-charting song in Billboard Hot 100 history, and was named the chart's best-performing song of all time. Other chart-topping singles from the album included \"[[Heartless (The Weeknd song)|Heartless]]\" and \"[[Save Your Tears]]\" with the latter gaining renewed popularity after a remix featuring [[Ariana Grande]]. Tesfaye began exploring [[dance-pop]], leading to his fifth album, ''[[Dawn FM]]'' (2022), which included the US top-ten single, \"[[Take My Breath]]\". In 2023, he co-created and starred in the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[The Idol (TV series)|The Idol]]'', which was a critical failure, while its [[Music from The Idol|accompanying soundtrack]] saw commercial success.\n\nTesfaye has sold over 75 million records, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling artists]]. He has earned seven [[RIAA certification|diamond-certifications]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for his singles, and is the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three spots on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. \"Blinding Lights\" became the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Top 10 songs of all time (1958\u20132021)|best-performing song in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100's history]] and the longest-charting song by a solo artist in the chart's history. Tesfaye was listed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as one of the world's [[Time 100|most influential people]] in 2020, and was dubbed the \"world's most popular artist\" by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' in 2023. An advocate for [[racial equality]] and [[food security]], he was appointed a [[World Food Programme]] [[Goodwill ambassador|Goodwill Ambassador]] in 2021. He has donated millions to causes related to racial equality, food security, and disaster relief, including substantial contributions to COVID-19 relief efforts and the Ethiopian humanitarian crisis.
