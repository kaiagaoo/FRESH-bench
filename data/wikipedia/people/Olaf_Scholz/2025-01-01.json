German politician who has been [[Chancellor of Germany]] since 2021. A member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), he previously served as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|vice chancellor]] in the [[fourth Merkel cabinet]] and as [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Minister of Finance]] from 2018 to 2021. He was also [[List of mayors of Hamburg|First Mayor of Hamburg]] from 2011 to 2018, deputy leader of the SPD from 2009 to 2019, and [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs|Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs]] from 2007 to 2009.\n\nScholz began his career as a lawyer specialising in [[employment law|labour and employment law]]. He became a member of the SPD in the 1970s and was a member of the [[Bundestag]] from 1998 to 2011. Scholz served in the [[Government of Hamburg|Hamburg Government]] under [[List of mayors of Hamburg|First Mayor]] [[Ortwin Runde]] in 2001 and became [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|general secretary]] of the SPD in 2002, where he served alongside SPD leader and then-chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]. He became his party's [[Chief Whip|chief whip]] in the Bundestag, later entering the [[First Merkel cabinet|First Merkel Government]] in 2007 as [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs|Federal Minister for Labour and Social Affairs]]. After the SPD moved into the opposition following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 election]], Scholz returned to lead the SPD in Hamburg. He was then elected deputy leader of the SPD. He led his party to victory in the [[2011 Hamburg state election]] and became first mayor, a position he held until 2018.\n\nAfter the Social Democratic Party entered the [[Fourth Merkel cabinet|fourth Merkel government]] in 2018, Scholz was appointed as both minister of finance and Vice Chancellor of Germany. In 2020, he was nominated as the SPD's [[candidate]] for Chancellor of Germany for the [[2021 German federal election|2021 federal election]]. The party won a plurality of seats in the [[Bundestag]] and formed a \"[[traffic light coalition]]\" with [[Alliance 90/The Greens]] and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]]. On 8 December 2021, Scholz was elected and sworn in as chancellor by the Bundestag, succeeding [[Angela Merkel]].\n\nAs chancellor, Scholz has overseen Germany's response to the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]]. Despite giving a restrained and timid response compared to many other Western leaders, Scholz oversaw a significant increase in the German defence budget, [[List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War|weapons shipments to Ukraine]], and the [[Nord Stream 2]] pipeline was put on hold. Three days after the invasion, Scholz set out the principles of a new German defence policy in his [[Zeitenwende speech]]. In September 2022, three of the four [[2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage|Nord Stream pipelines were destroyed]]. During the [[Israel\u2013Hamas war]], he authorized substantial German [[Military aid|military]] and medical aid to Israel, and denounced the actions of [[Hamas]] and other [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian militant groups]].
