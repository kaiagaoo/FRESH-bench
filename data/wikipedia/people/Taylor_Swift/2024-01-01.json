Her songwriting, artistry, and entrepreneurship have [[Cultural impact of Taylor Swift|influenced the music industry and popular culture]], and her life is [[Public image of Taylor Swift|a subject of widespread media coverage]].\n\nSwift began professional songwriting at age 14 and signed with [[Big Machine Records]] in 2005 to become a [[Country music|country]] singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to [[country radio]], starting with ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]'' (2006). Her next, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008), explored [[country pop]], and its singles \"[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]\" and \"[[You Belong with Me]]\" catapulted her to mainstream fame. ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010) infused [[Rock music|rock]] influences, while ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012) experimented with [[electronic music|electronic]] elements and featured Swift's first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one song, \"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\". She departed from her country image with ''[[1989 (album)|1989]]'' (2014), a [[synth-pop]] album supported by the chart-topping songs \"[[Shake It Off]]\", \"[[Blank Space]]\", and \"[[Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)|Bad Blood]]\". Media scrutiny inspired the [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]-flavored ''[[Reputation (album)|Reputation]]'' (2017) and its number-one single \"[[Look What You Made Me Do]]\".\n\nSwift signed with [[Republic Records]] in 2018. She released the eclectic pop album ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019) and autobiographical documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' (2020), embraced [[indie folk]] and [[alternative rock]] on 2020 albums ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'' and ''[[Evermore (Taylor Swift album)|Evermore]],'' explored understated pop styles on ''[[Midnights]]'' (2022), and released four [[Re-recording (music)|re-recorded]] albums subtitled ''Taylor's Version'' after a [[Taylor Swift masters dispute|dispute with Big Machine]]. These albums spawned the number-one songs \"[[Cruel Summer (Taylor Swift song)|Cruel Summer]]\", \"[[Cardigan (song)|Cardigan]]\", \"[[Willow (song)|Willow]]\", \"[[Anti-Hero (song)|Anti-Hero]]\", \"[[All Too Well]]\", and \"[[Is It Over Now?]]\". [[The Eras Tour]], her 2023\u20132024 concert tour, and its accompanying [[Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour|concert film]] both became the highest-grossing ever in their respective fields. Swift directed music videos and films such as ''[[All Too Well: The Short Film]]'' (2021).\n\nOne of [[List of best-selling music artists|the world's best-selling musicians]] with 200&nbsp;million records sold, Swift has earned 117 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' and received the [[Global Recording Artist of the Year]] award three times from the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]. She is the [[List of highest-grossing live music artists|highest-grossing female touring act]], the [[List of most-streamed artists on Spotify|most-streamed woman on Spotify]] and [[Apple Music]], and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. The 2023 [[Time Person of the Year|''Time'' Person of the Year]], Swift has appeared on lists such as [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|''Rolling Stone''{{'s}} 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]], [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]{{'s}} Greatest of All Time Artists, and the [[Forbes list of the World's 100 Most Powerful Women|World's 100 Most Powerful Women]] by ''[[Forbes]]''.
