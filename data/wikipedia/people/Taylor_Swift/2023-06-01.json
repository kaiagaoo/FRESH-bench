Recognized for her genre-spanning discography, songwriting, and artistic reinventions, Swift is a prominent [[Cultural impact of Taylor Swift|cultural figure]] who has been cited as an influence on a generation of music artists.\n\nSwift started professional songwriting at 14 and signed a recording contract with [[Big Machine Records]] in 2005 to become a [[Country music|country]] musician. Under Big Machine, she released six studio albums, four of which to [[country radio]], starting with her [[Taylor Swift (album)|self-titled album]] (2006). Her next record, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008), explored [[country pop]], and its singles \"[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]\" and \"[[You Belong with Me]]\" catapulted her to mainstream fame. ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010) incorporated [[Rock music|rock]] influences, and ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012) experimented with [[electronic music|electronic]] elements and featured Swift's first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one song, \"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\". She abandoned her country image with ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014), a [[synth-pop]] album supported by chart-topping songs \"[[Shake It Off]]\", \"[[Blank Space]]\", and \"[[Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)|Bad Blood]]\". Media scrutiny inspired her next album, the [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]-flavored ''[[Reputation (album)|Reputation]]'' (2017), and its number-one single \"[[Look What You Made Me Do]]\".\n\nSwift signed a new contract with [[Republic Records]] in 2018, and she released her seventh album ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019) and autobiographical documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' (2020), influenced by political disillusionment. Swift embraced [[indie folk]] and [[alternative rock]] on her 2020 albums ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'' and ''[[Evermore (Taylor Swift album)|Evermore]],'' and she incorporated [[Chill-out music|chill-out]] styles in ''[[Midnights]]'' (2022). The albums broke multifarious records, led by the respective singles \"[[Cardigan (song)|Cardigan]]\", \"[[Willow (song)|Willow]]\", and \"[[Anti-Hero (song)|Anti-Hero]]\". A [[Taylor Swift masters controversy|dispute with Big Machine]] led to Swift [[Re-recording (music)|re-recording]] her back catalog, and she released two re-recorded albums, ''[[Fearless (Taylor's Version)]]'' and ''[[Red (Taylor's Version)]]'', in 2021; the latter's \"[[All Too Well (10 Minute Version)]]\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Swift directed music videos and films such as ''[[All Too Well: The Short Film]]'' (2021), and played supporting roles in [[Taylor Swift videography|others]].\n\nHaving sold over 200 million records, Swift is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling musicians]], the most streamed woman on [[Spotify]], and the only act to have five albums open with over [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|one million copies sold]] in the US. She has been featured in critical listicles such as [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|''Rolling Stone''{{'s}} 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]], [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]{{'s}} Greatest of All Time Artists, the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]], and [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]]. Among [[List of awards and nominations received by Taylor Swift|her accolades]] are 12 [[Grammy Awards]], including three [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] wins; a [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]]; 40 [[American Music Awards]]; 29 [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]]; 12 [[Country Music Association Awards]]; three [[Global Recording Artist of the Year|IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year]] awards; and 92 ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. Honored with titles such as [[American Music Awards#Artist of the Decade|Artist of the Decade]] and [[Billboard Women in Music#Woman of the Decade Award|Woman of the Decade]], Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and [[women's empowerment]].\n\n==Life and career==\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Grandview Blvd 76, Wyomissing PA.JPG|thumb|Swift's childhood home in [[Wyomissing, Pennsylvania]]]]\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,<ref name=\"Newsround-2020\">{{Cite news|date=March 2, 2020 |title=Taylor Swift: The record-breaking artist in numbers|work=[[CBBC Newsround|Newsround]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/51711128|url-status=live|access-date=April 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308182512/https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/51711128|archive-date=March 8, 2020}}</ref> in [[West Reading, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"Sutherland-2015\">{{Cite news|last=Sutherland|first=Mark|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11430433/Taylor-Swift-interview-A-relationship-No-ones-going-to-sign-up-for-this.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11430433/Taylor-Swift-interview-A-relationship-No-ones-going-to-sign-up-for-this.html |archive-date=January 10, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Taylor Swift interview: 'A relationship?
