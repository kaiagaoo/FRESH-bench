A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was the 49th [[lieutenant governor of California]] from 2011 to 2019 and the 42nd [[mayor of San Francisco]] from 2004 to 2011.\n\nNewsom graduated from [[Santa Clara University]] in 1989. Afterward, he founded the boutique winery [[PlumpJack Winery|PlumpJack Group]] with billionaire heir and family friend [[Gordon Getty]] as an investor. The company grew to manage 23 businesses, including wineries, restaurants, and hotels. Newsom began his political career in 1996, when San Francisco mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] appointed him to the city's Parking and Traffic Commission. Brown then appointed Newsom to fill a vacancy on [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors|the Board of Supervisors]] the next year and Newsom was first elected to the board in 1998.\n\nNewsom was [[2003 San Francisco mayoral election|elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003]] and [[2007 San Francisco mayoral election|reelected in 2007]]. He was [[2010 California lieutenant gubernatorial election|elected lieutenant governor of California in 2010]]. As lieutenant governor, Newsom hosted ''[[The Gavin Newsom Show]]'' from 2012 to 2013. He also wrote the 2013 book ''[[Citizenville]]'', which focused on using digital tools for democratic change. He was [[2014 California lieutenant gubernatorial election|reelected in 2014]]. Newsom was [[2018 California gubernatorial election|elected governor of California in 2018]].\n\nDuring his governorship, Newsom faced criticism for his personal behavior and leadership during [[COVID-19 pandemic in California|the COVID-19 pandemic]]. He faced an [[2021 California gubernatorial recall election|unsuccessful attempt to recall him from office in 2021]]; he was [[2022 California gubernatorial election|reelected the next year]].\n\n== Early life ==\nNewsom was born on October 10, 1967, the son of Tessa Thomas (n\u00e9e Menzies) and [[William Newsom|William Alfred Newsom III]], a [[Appellate court|state appeals court judge]] and attorney for [[Getty Oil]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://governors.library.ca.gov/40-Newsom.html|title = Gavin Newsom|website = The Governors' Gallery|publisher = [[California State Library]]|accessdate = September 29, 2023}}</ref> He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan.
