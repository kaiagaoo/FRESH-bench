Truss founded the [[Free Enterprise Group]] of [[Thatcherite]] Conservative MPs and wrote or co-wrote a number of papers and books, including ''[[After the Coalition]]'' (2011) and ''[[Britannia Unchained]]'' (2012).\n\nTruss served as [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Childcare and Education]] from 2012 to 2014, before Cameron appointed her [[Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] in his [[2014 British cabinet reshuffle|2014 cabinet reshuffle]]. Although she supported the [[Britain Stronger in Europe]] campaign for the UK to remain in the [[European Union]], Truss supported [[Brexit]] after the outcome of the [[2016 UK European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. Following Cameron's resignation in 2016, his successor May appointed Truss as [[Secretary of State for Justice]] and [[Lord Chancellor]], making Truss the first woman to serve as lord chancellor in the office's thousand-year history. After the [[2017 UK general election|2017 general election]], Truss was appointed [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]]. After May resigned in 2019, Truss supported Johnson's successful bid to become Conservative leader and prime minister, after which he appointed Truss as [[Secretary of State for International Trade]] and [[President of the Board of Trade]] in July 2019; she subsequently took on the additional role of [[Minister for Women and Equalities|minister for women and equalities]] in September 2019. Johnson promoted Truss to foreign secretary in the [[2021 British cabinet reshuffle|2021 cabinet reshuffle]]. During [[Liz Truss' tenure as Foreign Secretary|her time in the position]], Truss co-chaired the [[EU\u2013UK Partnership Council]], led negotiations on the [[Northern Ireland Protocol]], and was involved in the UK's response to the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]].\n\nTruss defeated [[Rishi Sunak]] in the [[July\u2013September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election|Conservative Party leadership election]] to succeed Johnson, who had resigned in an [[July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis|earlier government crisis]]. Truss was appointed prime minister by [[Elizabeth II]] two days before [[Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II|the monarch's death]]; her government's business was subsequently suspended during a [[National day of mourning|national mourning period]] of 10 days. To tackle the [[2021\u2013present United Kingdom cost of living crisis|cost of living]] and [[2021 United Kingdom natural gas supplier crisis|energy supply crises]], [[Truss ministry|Truss's government]] announced the [[Energy Price Guarantee]] to limit energy prices for households, businesses and public-sector organisations.
