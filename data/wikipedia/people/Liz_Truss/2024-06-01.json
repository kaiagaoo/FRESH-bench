On her fiftieth day in office,<!--6 September to 25 October inclusive is 50 days--> she stepped down amid [[October 2022 United Kingdom government crisis|a government crisis]], making her the [[List of prime ministers of the United Kingdom by length of tenure|shortest-serving prime minister]] in British history. The [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[South West Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Norfolk]] since 2010, Truss previously held various [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] positions under three prime ministers{{emdash}}[[David Cameron]], [[Theresa May]] and [[Boris Johnson]]{{emdash}}lastly as [[Foreign Secretary|foreign secretary]] from 2021 to 2022. \n\nTruss studied [[philosophy, politics and economics]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]], and was the president of the [[Oxford University Liberal Democrats]]. In 1996 she joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. She worked at [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable & Wireless]] and was the deputy director of the think tank [[Reform (think tank)|Reform]]. After two unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]], she became the MP for South West Norfolk at the [[2010 general election (UK)|2010 general election]]. As a [[backbencher#United Kingdom|backbencher]] she called for reform in several policy areas including the economy, childcare and mathematics in education. Truss co-founded the [[Free Enterprise Group]] of Conservative MPs and wrote or co-wrote a number of papers and books, including ''[[After the Coalition]]'' and ''[[Britannia Unchained]]''.\n\nTruss was the [[parliamentary under-secretary of state for childcare and education]] from 2012 to 2014 before Cameron appointed her [[secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs]] in [[2014 British cabinet reshuffle|a cabinet reshuffle]]. Although she campaigned for the UK to remain in the [[European Union]], Truss supported [[Brexit]] following the outcome of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. Following Cameron's resignation in 2016, his successor Theresa May appointed her [[secretary of state for justice]] and [[lord chancellor]], making Truss the first woman to serve as lord chancellor in the office's thousand-year history; in the aftermath of the [[2017 general election (UK)|2017 general election]], she was demoted to [[chief secretary to the Treasury]]. After May announced her resignation in May 2019, Truss supported Johnson's successful bid to become Conservative leader and prime minister. He appointed Truss [[secretary of state for international trade]] and [[president of the Board of Trade]] in July and subsequently to the additional role of [[minister for women and equalities]] in September. Johnson promoted Truss to foreign secretary in the [[2021 British cabinet reshuffle|2021 cabinet reshuffle]]; during her time in the position, she led negotiations on the [[Northern Ireland Protocol]] and the UK's response to the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]].\n\nIn September 2022 Truss defeated [[Rishi Sunak]] in [[July\u2013September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election|a leadership election]] to succeed Johnson, who had resigned because of an [[July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis|earlier government crisis]], and was appointed as prime minister by [[Elizabeth II]] two days before [[Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II|the monarch's death]]; her government's business was subsequently suspended during a [[National day of mourning|national mourning period]] of ten days. In response to the [[2021\u2013present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis|rising cost of living]] and [[2021 United Kingdom natural gas supplier crisis|increased energy prices]], [[Truss ministry|her ministry]] announced the [[Energy Price Guarantee]]. The government then announced [[September 2022 United Kingdom mini-budget|large-scale tax cuts and borrowing]], which led to financial instability and were largely reversed. Facing mounting criticism and loss of confidence in her leadership, Truss announced her resignation as leader of the Conservative Party on 20 October. Sunak was [[October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election|elected unopposed]] as her successor, and appointed prime minister on 25 October.\n\n== Early life and education (1975\u20131996) ==\n[[File:Merton College, Oxford from Merton Field.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=A large building with spires and a tower pictured from a green lawn with a blue sky|left|[[Merton College, Oxford]], where Truss studied (pictured in 2023)]]\n\nMary Elizabeth Truss was born on 26 July 1975 at the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]] in [[Oxford]], England.{{Sfn|Cole|Heale|2022|p=5}} She was the second child of [[John Truss|John]] and Priscilla Truss ({{nee|Grasby}}); the year before Truss's birth, their first son, Matthew, had died.{{Sfn|Cole|Heale|2022|p=5}}{{refn|John and Priscilla had three children after Truss: Chris (born 1978), Patrick (born 1980) and Francis (born 1983).{{Sfnm|1a1=Glancy|1a2=Daniel|1y=2022|2a1=Grylls|2a2=Norfolk|2a3=Wace|2y=2022|3a1=Cole|3a2=Heale|3y=2022|3p=8}}|group= n}} Truss was known by her middle name, ''Elizabeth'', from early childhood, with her father\u2014a professor of [[pure mathematics]] at the [[University of Leeds]]\u2014using it regularly, which she preferred;{{Sfnm|1a1=Cole|1a2=Heale|1y=2022|1pp=5 and 9|2a1=Belam|2y=2022}} after being given a badge with \"Mary\" on it on her first day of school, Truss asked her teacher that it be changed.{{Sfn|Cole|Heale|2022|p=9}} She later described her parents' politics as being \"to the left of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\";{{Sfn|Ellery|2022}} her mother, a teacher and nurse, was a member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].{{Sfnm|1a1=\"Profile: Elizabeth Truss\".
