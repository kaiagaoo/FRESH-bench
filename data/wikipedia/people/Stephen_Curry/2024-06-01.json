embrace a [[pace and space]] and three-point shooting style.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> The increase in three-point shooting is partly due to NBA teams incorporating it in their attempts to defeat the Warriors or copy the Warriors' style of play, and to young people wanting to imitate Curry's shooting range.<ref name=\"Dougherty\" /><ref name=\"O\" /> Although this has led to players becoming good at or improving their three-point shot, it has also set unrealistic standards because Curry's range is unique.<ref name=\"Dougherty\" /> Curry regularly takes shots from between 30 and 35 feet.<ref name=\"Goldsberry\" /> He shoots 54 percent from this range, while the NBA makes 35 percent of its threes overall and under 22 percent from between 30 and 35 feet.<ref name=\"Goldsberry\" /> He can make the shots with elite ball handling, off the dribble, and often with an extremely quick release, from anywhere on the court and with one or more defenders on him.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> Curry said that he is sure coaches tell their high school players that shooting the way he does takes work and time.<ref name=\"Dougherty\" /> Jesse Dougherty of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that \"coaches have to explain that while Curry's skill set is something to aspire to, his game is built on fundamentals\" and that \"while the Warriors have become the NBA's gold standard and make all those social-media-bound plays, the root of their success is ball movement.\"<ref name=\"Dougherty\" />\n\nKirk Goldsberry of ESPN opined that \"one of the keys to [Curry's] greatness is his range\" and that \"Curry isn't just the best 3-point shooter ever, he's the best deep 3-point shooter ever.\"<ref name=\"Goldsberry\" /> Sally Jenkins of ''The Washington Post'' stated that he \"moves around behind the three-point line in an ever-widening arc, sinking long distance shots so cleanly that the net seems to snap like fresh laundry in a breeze\" and that a highlight is the \"sheer preposterousness of his shots, and the rate at which he is sinking the most far-fetched of them.\" She said that \"in one stretch he hit a mind-expanding 67 percent between 28 and 50 feet.\"<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> Warriors Coach Steve Kerr stated that Curry's hand-eye coordination \"is as great as anyone I've ever seen.\"<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> Jeff Austin of [[Octagon (sports

player in the history of the NBA has combined range, volume and efficiency from downtown as well as Curry\" and that \"Curry's jumper is so lethal that he has become the most efficient volume scorer

He pays a tax for his great teammates.\"<ref name=\"Windhorst\" /> [[Scottie Pippen]], who won six NBA titles with the [[Chicago Bulls]], said that Curry's \"willingness to sacrifice\" for [[Kevin Durant]] is \"one of the great stories in history\" because Curry welcomed Durant, who is also a top player, to the Warriors without ego.
