the Chinese Communist Party|general secretary]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission (China)|chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC), and thus as the [[paramount leader]] of China, since 2012. Xi has also been the [[president of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC) since 2013. He belongs to the fifth [[Generations of Chinese leadership|generation of Chinese leadership]].\n{{Xi Jinping sidebar}}\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], Xi was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. He lived in a [[yaodong]] in the village of Liangjiahe, [[Shaanxi|Shaanxi province]], where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]]. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at [[Tsinghua University]] as a [[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student|worker-peasant-soldier student]], Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was [[governor of Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring [[Politics of Zhejiang|Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC) of the CCP the same year and was the first-ranking secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party|Central Secretariat]] in October 2007. In 2008, he was designated as [[Hu Jintao]]'s presumed [[Succession of power in China|successor]] as paramount leader; to that end, Xi was appointed [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president of the PRC]] and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|vice chairman of the CMC]]. He officially received the title of [[leadership core]] from the CCP in 2016.\n\nXi is the first CCP general secretary born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment of the PRC]]. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including former PSC member [[Zhou Yongkang]]. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013United States relations|China's relations with the U.S]]., the [[nine-dash line]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and the [[Sino-Indian border dispute]]. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the [[Belt and Road Initiative]]. Xi has expanded support for [[State-owned enterprises of China|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs), advanced [[military-civil fusion]], overseen [[Targeted Poverty Alleviation|targeted poverty alleviation]] programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. He has also promoted \"[[common prosperity]]\", a series of policies designed with stated goal to increase equality, oversaw a broad crackdown and major slew of regulations against the tech and tutoring sectors in 2021. Xi [[Ma\u2013Xi meeting|met]] with Taiwanese president [[Ma Ying-jeou]] in 2015, the first time PRC and Republic of China leaders met, though relations deteriorated after [[Tsai Ing-wen]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016. He responded to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China]] with a [[zero-COVID]] approach from January 2020 until December 2022, afterwards shifting towards a [[mitigation strategy]]. Xi also oversaw the passage of a [[Hong Kong national security law|national security law in Hong Kong]], clamping down on political opposition in the city, especially [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy activists]].\n\nOften described as an authoritarian leader by political and academic observers, Xi's tenure has included an increase of [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], deterioration in [[Human rights in China|human rights]], including the [[Xinjiang internment camps|internment of a million Uyghurs in Xinjiang]] (which some observers have described as part of [[Uyghur genocide|a genocide]]), a [[Xi Jinping's cult of personality|cult of personality]] developing around Xi, and the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Xi's political ideas and principles, known as [[Xi Jinping Thought]], have been incorporated into the [[Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party|party]] and [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|national constitutions]]. As the central figure of the [[Generations of Chinese leadership|fifth generation of leadership]] of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including new CCP committees on national security, economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. He and the CCP [[Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|Central Committee]] passed a \"[[Third Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party over the Past Century|historical resolution]]\" in November 2021. In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, and was reelected state president for a third term in March 2023.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nXi Jinping was born in [[Beijing]] on 15 June 1953,{{sfn|Wong|2023|p=229}} the third child of [[Xi Zhongxun]] and his second wife [[Qi Xin]].

These were essentially cross-jurisdictional squads of officials whose main task was to gain more in-depth understanding of the operations of provincial and local party organizations, and in the process, also enforce party discipline mandated by Beijing.

Over one hundred provincial-ministerial level officials were implicated during a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign.
