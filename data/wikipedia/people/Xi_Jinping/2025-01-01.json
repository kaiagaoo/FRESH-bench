secretary of the Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission (China)|chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC), and thus the [[paramount leader]] of China, since 2012. Xi has been serving as the seventh [[president of China]] since 2013. As a member of the fifth [[Generations of Chinese leadership|generation of Chinese leadership]], Xi is the first CCP general secretary born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC).\n{{Xi Jinping sidebar}}\n\nThe son of Chinese communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], Xi was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. He lived in a [[yaodong]] in the village of Liangjiahe, [[Shaanxi|Shaanxi province]], where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]]. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at [[Tsinghua University]] as a [[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student|worker-peasant-soldier student]], Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was [[governor of Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring [[Politics of Zhejiang|Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC) of the CCP the same year and was the first-ranking secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party|Central Secretariat]] in October 2007. In 2008, he was designated as [[Hu Jintao]]'s presumed [[Succession of power in China|successor]] as paramount leader. Towards this end, Xi was appointed [[Vice President of China|vice president of the PRC]] and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|vice chairman of the CMC]]. He officially received the title of [[leadership core]] from the CCP in 2016.\n\nWhile overseeing China's domestic policy, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and strengthen internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including former PSC member [[Zhou Yongkang]]. For the sake of promoting \"[[common prosperity]]\", Xi has enacted a series of policies designed to increase equality, overseen [[Targeted Poverty Alleviation|targeted poverty alleviation]] programs, and directed a broad crackdown in 2021 against the tech and tutoring sectors. Furthermore, he has expanded support for [[State-owned enterprises of China|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs), advanced [[military-civil fusion]], and attempted to reform China's property sector. Following the onset of [[COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China]], he initially presided over a [[zero-COVID]] policy from January 2020 to December 2022 before ultimately shifting towards a [[mitigation strategy]].\n\nXi has pursued a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013United States relations|China's relations with the U.S.]], the [[nine-dash line]] in the [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|South China Sea]], and the [[Sino-Indian border dispute]]. Additionally, for the sake of advancing Chinese economic interests abroad, Xi has sought to expand China's influence in Africa and Eurasia by championing the [[Belt and Road Initiative]]. Despite meeting with Taiwanese president [[Ma Ying-jeou]] in 2015, Xi presided over a deterioration in relations between Beijing and Taipei under Ma's successor, [[Tsai Ing-wen]]. In 2020, Xi oversaw the passage of a [[2020 Hong Kong national security law|national security law in Hong Kong]] which clamped down on political opposition in the city, especially [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy activists]].\n\nSince coming to power, Xi's tenure has witnessed a significant increase in [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], a deterioration in [[Human rights in China|human rights]], including the [[Persecution of Uyghurs in China|internment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang]], the rise of a [[Xi Jinping's cult of personality|cult of personality]] around his leadership, and the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Xi's political ideas and principles, known as [[Xi Jinping Thought]], have been incorporated into the [[Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party|party]] and [[Constitution of China|national constitutions]]. As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including new CCP committees on national security, economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the internet. In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, and was re-elected state president for a third term in March 2023.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nXi Jinping was born on 15 June 1953 in [[Beijing]],{{sfn|Wong|2023|p=21}} the third child of [[Xi Zhongxun]] and his second wife [[Qi Xin]].
