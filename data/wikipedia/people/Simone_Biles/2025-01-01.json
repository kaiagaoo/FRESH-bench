She joined Latynina (1956\u20131960), \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 (1964\u20131968), and [[Luydmila Tourischeva]] (1968\u20131972), as the fourth female gymnast to win every major all-around title in an Olympic cycle.\n\nBiles joined [[Mary Lou Retton]] in 1984, [[Shannon Miller]] in 1992, and [[Nastia Liukin]] in 2008, in winning five women's gymnastics medals at a single Olympics, along with Szabo (Roumania, 1984), [[Nadia Comaneci]] (Roumania, 1976), and [[Karin Janz]] (East Germany, 1972). [[Olga Mostepanova]] (USSR) also won five gold medals at the [[Friendship Games|Alternate Olympics]] in 1984.
