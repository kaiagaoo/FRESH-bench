A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], she was the first woman elected as U.S. House Speaker and the first woman to lead a major political party in either chamber of [[United States Congress|Congress]], leading the [[House Democratic Caucus|House Democrats]] from 2003 to 2023. A member of the House since 1987, Pelosi currently represents {{ushr|CA|11}}, which includes most of [[San Francisco]]. She is the dean of [[United States congressional delegations from California|California's congressional delegation]].\n\nPelosi was born and raised in [[Baltimore]], and is the daughter of mayor and congressman [[Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.]] She graduated from [[Trinity Washington University|Trinity College, Washington]] in 1962 and married businessman [[Paul Pelosi]] the next year; the two had met while both were students. They moved to New York City before settling down in San Francisco with their children. Focused on raising her family, Pelosi stepped into politics as a volunteer for the Democratic Party in the 1960s. After years of party work, rising to chair the state party, she was first elected to Congress in a [[1987 California's 5th congressional district special election|1987 special election]] and is now in her 19th term; she is the longest-serving member of California's Congressional delegation.

During her first speakership, Pelosi was a major opponent of the [[Iraq War]] as well as the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration's]] [[Social Security debate in the United States|attempts to partially privatize]] [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. She participated in the passage of the [[Presidency of Barack Obama#Major acts and legislation|Obama administration's landmark bills]], including the [[Affordable Care Act]], the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act]], the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], and the [[2010 Tax Relief Act]]. Pelosi lost the speakership after the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] retook the majority in the [[2010 midterm elections]], but she retained her role as leader of the House Democrats and became House minority leader for a second time.\n\nIn the [[2018 midterm elections]], Democrats regained majority control of the House, and Pelosi [[2019 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election|was again elected Speaker]], becoming the first former speaker to reclaim the gavel since [[Sam Rayburn]] in 1955. During her second speakership, the House twice [[Federal impeachment in the United States|impeached]] President [[Donald Trump]], [[First impeachment of Donald Trump|first in December 2019]] and [[Second impeachment of Donald Trump|again in January 2021]]; the [[United States Senate|Senate]] acquitted Trump both times.

In the [[2022 midterm elections]], Republicans narrowly regained control of the House for the new Congress, ending her tenure as speaker. She subsequently retired as House Democratic leader. On November 29, 2022, the [[Steering and Policy Committees of the United States House of Representatives|Steering and Policy Committee]] of the House Democratic Caucus named Pelosi \"Speaker Emerita\". Expert assessments of Pelosi's two tenures as speaker have generally considered her to have had a very strong grasp on power in the Democratic majorities and to have been highly effective at the job.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nNancy Pelosi was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], to an [[Italian-American]] family.
