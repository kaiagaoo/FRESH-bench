Modi was the [[List of chief ministers of Gujarat|Chief Minister of Gujarat]] from 2001 to 2014 and is the [[Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha|Member of Parliament]] from [[Varanasi (Lok Sabha constituency)|Varanasi]]. He is a member of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), a right-wing [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalist]] paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest serving prime minister from outside the [[Indian National Congress]]. \n\nModi was born and raised in [[Vadnagar]] in northeastern [[Gujarat]], where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has reminisced about helping out after school at his father's tea stall at the Vadnagar railway station. At age 18, Modi was married to [[Jashodaben Modi|Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi]], whom he abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] was declared by prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]] in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.{{Efn|Sources stating that [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]] had a deep impact on the political hierarchy of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]], specially in the case of Narendra Modi.<ref name=\"Asrar\">{{#invoke:Cite web||url=https://www.ndtv.com/elections-news/narendra-modis-political-journey-from-rss-worker-to-bjps-pm-candidate-534530|website=[[NDTV]]|title=Narendra Modi's political journey from RSS worker to BJP's PM candidate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808041721/https://www.ndtv.com/elections-news/narendra-modis-political-journey-from-rss-worker-to-bjps-pm-candidate-534530|archive-date=8 August 2020|last=Asrar|first=Nadim|date=26 February 2014|access-date=15 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{#invoke:cite web||url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-turns-69-a-timeline-of-his-political-career-761937.html|website=[[Deccan Herald]]|title=PM Modi turns 69: A timeline of his political career|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210115073300/https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-turns-69-a-timeline-of-his-political-career-761937.html|archive-date=15 January 2021|date=17 September 2019|access-date=13 January 2021|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{#invoke:cite web||first=Ravish|last=Tiwari|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/20141208-rss-sangh-nda-bjp-l-k-advani-narendra-modi-cover-story-806098-2014-11-27|title=The low-profile RSS apparatchik is the newface of power in the NDA|website=[[India Today]]|date=27 November 2014|access-date=13 January 2021}}</ref>|name=|group=}}\n\nModi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to [[Keshubhai Patel]]'s failing health and poor public image following the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|earthquake in Bhuj]].

On the other hand, India's modest democracy performance in the V-Dem data fully confirms Alexander, Welzel, and Inglehart (2012) who argue that India's state of democracy is overestimated by standard measures and needs to take account of serious deficiencies in rule of law and human rights enforcement (cf.

The focal point in this regard is the rise of populist demagogues and authoritarian strongmen who have caused democratic decline by cracking down on political dissent and curbing the autonomy of the judiciary and the free press, thus creating the conditions for democratic backsliding and decline (Levitsky and Ziblatt, 2018). The path of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in India since 2014 seems to fit this description. The BJP's hegemonic control of Indian politics has been coterminous with aggressive cultural nationalist rhetoric manifesting itself as routinized intimidation and killing of journalists and political critics, vigilante lynching of Muslims, and a general clampdown on dissent (Kesavan, 2017). Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister and leader of the BJP epitomizes the populist strongman with his charismatic appeal, centralization of power (Vaishnav, 2019), and ability to connect with the masses through clever use of media (Martelli and Jaffrelot, 2017; Vaishnav, 2021). Not surprisingly, scholars and commentators looking at contemporary Indian politics converge on the idea that Modi's populist leadership of the BJP is the reason for the havoc being wreaked on democratic institutions in the country (Kinnvall, 2019; Chatterji et al., 2019; Basu, 2018; Chacko, 2018; Nilsen, 2018)}}</ref>{{Efn|name=lo9|group=lower-alpha|Sources describing that India has experienced a [[Democratic backsliding|backslide in democracy]]:<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brunkert|first1=Lennart|last2=Kruse|first2=Stefan|last3=Welzel|first3=Christian|date=3 April 2019|title=A tale of culture-bound regime evolution: the centennial democratic trend and its recent reversal|url=http://fox.leuphana.de/portal/de/publications/a-tale-of-culturebound-regime-evolution-the-centennial-democratic-trend-and-its-recent-reversal(2b6baaf4-3942-4491-92ca-55782d455a62).html|journal=Democratization|volume=26|issue=3|pages=422\u2013443|doi=10.1080/13510347.2018.1542430|s2cid=148625260|issn=1351-0347}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Khaitan|first=Tarunabh|date=26 May 2020|title=Killing a Constitution with a Thousand Cuts: Executive Aggrandizement and Party-state Fusion in India|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/lehr/14/1/article-p49.xml|journal=Law & Ethics of Human Rights|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=49\u201395|doi=10.1515/lehr-2020-2009|s2cid=221083830|issn=2194-6531}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|last=Ganguly|first=Sumit|title=India's Democracy Is Under Threat|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/09/18/indias-democracy-is-under-threat/|date=18 September 2020|access-date=27 November 2020|website=[[Foreign Policy]]|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2021|title=India: Freedom in the World 2021 Country Report|url=https://freedomhouse.org/country/india/freedom-world/2021|journal=[[Freedom House]]|volume=|pages=|via=|quote=While India is a multiparty democracy, the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has presided over discriminatory policies and increased violence affecting the Muslim population.
