A member of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] since 2006, she has led the right-wing [[Brothers of Italy]] (FdI) political party since 2014, and she has been the president of the [[European Conservatives and Reformists Party]] since 2020.\n\nIn 1992, Meloni joined the [[Youth Front (Italy)|Youth Front]], the youth wing of the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), a [[neo-fascist]] political party founded in 1946 by former followers of [[Italian fascism]]. She later became the national leader of [[Student Action (Italy)|Student Action]], the student movement of the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN), a [[Post-fascism in Italy|post-fascist]] party that became the MSI's legal successor in 1995 and moved towards [[national conservatism]]. She was a councillor of the [[Province of Rome]] from 1998 to 2002, after which she became the president of [[Youth Action (Italy)|Youth Action]], the youth wing of AN. In 2008, she was appointed [[Italian Minister of Youth]] in the [[fourth Berlusconi government]], a role which she held until 2011. In 2012, she co-founded FdI, a legal successor to AN, and became its president in 2014. She unsuccessfully ran in the [[2014 European Parliament election]] and the [[2016 Rome municipal election]]. After the [[2018 Italian general election]], she led FdI in opposition during the entire [[18th Italian legislature]]. FdI grew its popularity in opinion polls, particularly during the management of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Italy]] by the [[Draghi Cabinet]], a [[national unity government]] to which FdI was the only opposition party. Following the [[fall of the Draghi government]], FdI won the [[2022 Italian general election]].\n\nMeloni is a Christian and a [[Conservatism in Italy|conservative]], and she believes in defending \"God, fatherland, and family\".

Meloni supports a [[naval blockade]] to halt immigration, and she has been accused of [[xenophobia]] and [[Islamophobia]]. A supporter of [[NATO]], she maintains [[Eurosceptic]] views regarding the [[European Union]], which she describes as [[Eurorealist]]. She was in favour of improved relations with Russia before the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], which she condemned, pledging to keep sending arms to Ukraine.
