This is an important problem in biology, as proteins are essential to life, almost every biological function depends on them, and the function of a protein is thought to be related to its structure. Knowing the structure of a protein can be very helpful in drug discovery and disease understanding. In December 2018, DeepMind's tool [[AlphaFold]] won the 13th [[Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction]] (CASP) by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins. \"This is a lighthouse project, our first major investment in terms of people and resources into a fundamental, very important, real-world scientific problem\", Hassabis said to ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sample |first=Ian |date=2 December 2018 |title=Google's DeepMind predicts 3D shapes of proteins |language=en |website=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/02/google-deepminds-ai-program-alphafold-predicts-3d-shapes-of-proteins |url-status=live |access-date=3 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190718162031/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/02/google-deepminds-ai-program-alphafold-predicts-3d-shapes-of-proteins |archive-date=18 July 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Demis Hassabis, 2024 Nobel Prize Laureate in Chemistry 6.jpg|thumb|Hassabis at 2024 Nobel Week]]\nIn November 2020, DeepMind again announced world-beating results in the CASP14 edition of the competition with AlphaFold 2, a new version of the system. It achieved a median [[global distance test]] (GDT) score of 87.0 across protein targets in the challenging free-modeling category, much higher than the same 2018 results with a median GDT < 60, and an overall error of less than the width of an atom (<1 [[Angstrom]]), making it competitive with experimental methods, and leading the organisers of CASP to declare the problem essentially solved.<ref>{{Cite web |date=30 November 2020 |title=AlphaFold: a solution to a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology |url=https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201130153625/https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology |archive-date=30 November 2020 |access-date=30 November 2020 |website=[[DeepMind]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Briggs |first=Helen |date=30 November 2020 |title=One of biology's biggest mysteries 'largely solved' by AI |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55133972 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201130212208/https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55133972 |archive-date=30 November 2020 |access-date=30 November 2020 |website=[[BBC News]] |language=en}}</ref> Over the next year DeepMind used AlphaFold2 to fold all 200 million proteins known to science, and made the system and these structures openly and freely available for anyone to use via the [https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/ AlphaFold Protein Structure Database] developed in collaboration with [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EMBL-EBI]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Geddes |first=Linda |date=2022-07-28 |title=DeepMind uncovers structure of 200m proteins in scientific leap forward |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/28/deepmind-uncovers-structure-of-200m-proteins-in-scientific-leap-forward |access-date=2024-11-01 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\n==Personal life==\nHassabis is married to an Italian molecular biologist with whom he has two sons.
