He was previously [[Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from 2008 to 2016. He was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from 2001 to 2008 and for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] from 2015 to 2023.\n\nIn his youth Johnson attended [[Eton College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and he was elected [[president of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. In 1989 he began writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', and from 1999 to 2005 he was the editor of ''[[The Spectator]]''. He became a member of the [[Shadow Cabinet of Michael Howard]] in 2001 before being dismissed over a claim that he had lied about an extramarital affair. After Howard resigned Johnson became a member of [[David Cameron]]'s [[Shadow Cabinet of David Cameron|Shadow Cabinet]]. He was [[2008 London mayoral election|elected mayor of London in 2008]] and [[Resignation from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom|resigned from the House of Commons]] to focus his attention on the mayoralty. He was [[2012 London mayoral election|re-elected mayor in 2012]], but did not run for re-election [[2016 London mayoral election|in 2016]]. At the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] he was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Johnson was a prominent figure in the [[Vote Leave|Brexit campaign]] in the [[2016 EU membership referendum]]. After the referendum Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] appointed him foreign secretary. He resigned from the position in 2018 in protest at both the [[Chequers Agreement]] and May's approach to Brexit.\n\nJohnson succeeded May as prime minister. He [[Brexit negotiations in 2019|re-opened Brexit negotiations]] with the EU and in early September [[2019 British prorogation controversy|he prorogued Parliament]]; the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] later ruled the prorogation to have been unlawful. After agreeing to a revised [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]] but [[Parliamentary votes on Brexit|failing to win parliamentary support]], Johnson called [[2019 United Kingdom general election|a snap general election]] to be held in December 2019, in which he won a [[landslide victory]]. During [[Johnson's premiership]], the government [[British government response to the COVID-19 pandemic|responded to the COVID-19 pandemic]] by introducing various [[Coronavirus Act 2020|emergency powers]] to mitigate its impact and approved [[COVID-19 vaccination in the United Kingdom|a nationwide vaccination programme]]. He also [[United Kingdom and the Russian invasion of Ukraine|responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine]] by imposing [[International sanctions during the Russian invasion of Ukraine|sanctions on Russia]] and authorising [[List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War|foreign aid and weapons shipments]] to Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite news |date=29 June 2022 |title=UK Gives \u00a31 Billion to Ukraine to Help Fund Offensive Operations |work=Bloomberg.com |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-29/uk-gives-1-billion-to-ukraine-to-help-fund-offensive-operations |access-date=7 July 2022 }}</ref> In the [[Partygate]] scandal it was found that numerous parties had been held at [[10 Downing Street]] during [[COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom|national COVID-19 lockdowns]], and COVID-19 social distancing laws were breached by 83 individuals, including Johnson, who in April 2022 was issued with a [[fixed penalty notice]]. The publishing of the [[Sue Gray report]] in May 2022 and a widespread sense of dissatisfaction led in June 2022 to a [[2022 vote of confidence in the Conservative Party leadership of Boris Johnson|vote of confidence in his leadership]] amongst Conservative MPs, which he won. In July 2022, revelations over [[Chris Pincher scandal|his appointment of Chris Pincher]] as [[Deputy Chief Whip|deputy chief whip]] of the party while knowing of allegations of sexual misconduct against him led to a [[July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis|mass resignation of members of his government]] and to Johnson announcing his resignation as prime minister. He was succeeded as prime minister by [[Liz Truss]], his foreign secretary. He remained in the House of Commons as a [[backbencher]] until June 2023, when he received the draft of the [[Commons Privileges Committee investigation into Boris Johnson|Commons Privileges Committee investigation into his conduct]] that unanimously found that he had lied to the Commons on numerous occasions. Johnson resigned his position as MP the same day.\n\n[[Public image of Boris Johnson|Johnson is a controversial figure]] in British politics. His supporters have praised him for being humorous, witty and entertaining, with an appeal reaching beyond traditional Conservative Party voters, viewing him as an electoral asset to the party. Conversely, his critics have accused him of lying, [[elitism]], [[cronyism]] and [[bigotry]]. During his premiership his supporters praised him for \"[[Get Brexit Done|getting Brexit done]]\", overseeing the UK's COVID-19 vaccination programme, which was amongst the fastest in the world, and being one of the first world leaders to offer [[List of humanitarian aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War|humanitarian support to Ukraine]] following the Russian invasion of the country. His tenure also encompassed several controversies and scandals, and is viewed as the most scandalous premiership of modern times by historians and biographers alike.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early life and education==\n===Childhood===\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born on 19 June 1964 in the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], New York City,<ref>{{cite news |last=Lawless |first=Jill |date=23 July 2019 |title=Boris Johnson's Chaotic Path to Power Finally Pays Off |work=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://apnews.com/b48561749c65479fbadbcdc35808343a |access-date=31 July 2019 |archive-date=31 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731085804/https://apnews.com/b48561749c65479fbadbcdc35808343a |url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=10|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=1}} to [[Stanley Johnson (writer)|Stanley Johnson]], then studying economics at [[Columbia University]],{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=11|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=2}} and [[Charlotte Johnson Wahl|Charlotte Fawcett]],<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news |last=Llewellyn Smith |first=Julia |date=18 May 2008 |title=Boris Johnson, by his mother Charlotte Johnson Wahl |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/borisjohnson/1976150/Boris-Johnson-by-his-mother-Charlotte-Johnson-Wahl.html |url-status=dead |work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]] |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123154217/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/borisjohnson/1976150/Boris-Johnson-by-his-mother-Charlotte-Johnson-Wahl.html |archive-date=23 January 2011 |access-date=16 April 2020 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> an artist, whose father [[James Fawcett (barrister)|Sir James Fawcett]], was a prominent [[barrister]] and president of the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] from 1972 to 1981.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/borisjohnson/1924866/London-mayor-elections-2008-Family-of-influence-behind-Boris-Johnson.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Family of influence behind Boris Johnson | date=3 May 2008 | access-date=6 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123154101/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/borisjohnson/1924866/London-mayor-elections-2008-Family-of-influence-behind-Boris-Johnson.html | archive-date=23 January 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Johnson is one of only two British prime ministers to have been an [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|American citizen]] {{crossreference|(see [[Honorary citizenship of the United States]])}}.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Frost |first=Amanda |title=Everyone born in the United States is a U.S. citizen.
