He was [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from October 2022 to November 2024. Following his defeat to [[Keir Starmer]]\u2019s [[Labour Party (United Kingdom)|Labour Party]] in the [[2024 United Kingdom general election|2024 general election]], he became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], serving in this role from July to November 2024. The first [[British Asian]] to hold those offices, he previously held two [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] positions under [[Boris Johnson]], latterly as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] from 2020 to 2022. Sunak has been [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Richmond and Northallerton (UK Parliament constituency)|Richmond and Northallerton]], previously [[Richmond (Yorks) (UK Parliament constituency)|Richmond (Yorks)]], since 2015. Following the stepping down of [[Boris Johnson]] in 2023 and [[Theresa May]] in 2024, combined with [[South West Norfolk in the 2024 United Kingdom general election|the loss]] of [[Liz Truss]]'s seat, Sunak is the only former Prime Minister still remaining in the House of Commons.\n<!--Early life, business career, early political career-->\n\nSunak was born in [[Southampton]] to parents of Indian descent who immigrated to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. He was educated at [[Winchester College]], studied [[philosophy, politics and economics]] at [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], and earned a [[Master of Business Administration]] from [[Stanford University]] in California as a [[Fulbright Scholar]]. During his time at Oxford University, Sunak undertook an internship at [[Conservative Central Office]], and joined the Conservatives. After graduating, Sunak worked for [[Goldman Sachs]] and later as a partner at the [[hedge fund]] firms [[the Children's Investment Fund Management]] and [[Theleme Partners]]. Sunak was elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]]. As a [[backbencher]], Sunak supported the successful campaign for [[Brexit]] in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union membership referendum]]. Sunak was appointed to the junior ministerial position of [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Local Government]] by [[Theresa May]] in 2019, and was appointed to the cabinet-attending role of [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] by Johnson in 2019.<!--Tenure as Chancellor of the Exchequer-->\n\nIn 2020, Sunak was promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer. During [[Chancellorship of Rishi Sunak|his time in the position]], Sunak was prominent in the [[British government response to the COVID-19 pandemic|government's financial response]] to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]] and its [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|economic impact]], including the [[Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme|furlough]] and [[Eat Out to Help Out]] schemes, and was also prominent in the government's response to the [[2021\u2013present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis|cost-of living crisis]]. As chancellor, Sunak received high approval and popularity ratings in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, although his popularity later declined amid the cost-of living crisis in 2022. He resigned as chancellor in July 2022 amid [[July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis|a government crisis]] that culminated in Johnson's resignation, and stood in the [[July\u2013September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to succeed him. He received the most votes in each of the series of MP votes, but lost the members' vote to [[Liz Truss]]. After spending the duration of [[Truss's premiership]] on the backbenches, Sunak was elected unopposed in the [[October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to succeed Truss, who resigned amid another [[October 2022 United Kingdom government crisis|government crisis]]; aged 42 at the time he became prime minister, Sunak became the youngest prime minister since [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|The Earl of Liverpool]] in 1812.\n<!--Tenure as Prime Minister-->\n\nDuring [[Premiership of Rishi Sunak|his premiership]], Sunak attempted to improve the economy and stabilise national politics. He outlined five key priorities: halving inflation, growing the economy, cutting debt, reducing [[National Health Service]] waiting lists, and stopping the illegal [[English Channel migrant crossings (2018\u2013present)|small-boat crossings of the English Channel]] by enacting the [[Rwanda asylum plan]]. On foreign policy, Sunak authorised [[United Kingdom and the Russian invasion of Ukraine|foreign aid and weapons shipments]] to [[Ukraine]] in response to the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of the country]], and pledged support for [[Israel]] after the [[2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel|attacks]] which began the [[Israel\u2013Hamas war]] whilst later calling for a ceasefire in the [[Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip (2023\u2013present)|Gaza Strip]]. He did not avert further unpopularity for the Conservatives, reflected in the party's poor performances in the [[2023 United Kingdom local elections|2023]] and [[2024 United Kingdom local elections|2024 local elections]]. Sunak called a general election for July 2024 despite being widely expected to call the election in the autumn; the Conservatives lost this election in a landslide to the opposition [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Keir Starmer]], ending 14 years of Conservative government. \n<!--Post-premiership and legacy--> \n\nAfter leaving office, Sunak became Leader of the Opposition and remained Conservative leader for nearly four months while the [[2024 Conservative Party leadership election (UK)|leadership election]] to replace him took place, and formed a [[Shadow Cabinet of Rishi Sunak|shadow cabinet]]. He was succeeded by [[Kemi Badenoch]], his [[Shadow Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government|Shadow Housing Secretary]]. He also intends to remain as a backbench MP for the next five years. \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Early life and education (1980\u20132001) ==\nRishi Sunak was born on 12 May 1980 in [[Southampton General Hospital]] in [[Southampton]], Hampshire,<ref name=\"Hooker\" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Rishi Sunak's Southampton childhood described in Lord Ashcroft biography |url=https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/18865935.amp/ |access-date=26 October 2022 |work=Daily Echo |archive-date=24 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221024165656/https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/18865935.amp/ |url-status=live }}</ref> to [[Punjabi diaspora|East African-born]] Hindu parents of Indian Punjabi descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63345272.amp|date=24 October 2022|title=Rishi Sunak: A quick guide to the UK's new prime minister|access-date=26 April 2023|publisher=[[BBC News]]|quote=His parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin.
