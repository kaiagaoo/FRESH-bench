Prior to his acting career, he obtained a degree in law from the [[Kyiv National Economic University]]. He then pursued a career in comedy and created the production company [[Kvartal 95]], which produced films, cartoons, and TV shows including the TV series ''[[Servant of the People (TV series)|Servant of the People]]'', in which Zelenskyy played the role of the Ukrainian president. The series aired from 2015 to 2019 and was immensely popular. [[Servant of the People|A political party]] bearing the same name as the television show was created in March 2018 by employees of Kvartal 95.\n\nZelenskyy announced his candidacy in the [[2019 Ukrainian presidential election|2019 presidential election]] on the evening of 31 December 2018, alongside the New Year's Eve address of then-president [[Petro Poroshenko]] on the TV channel [[1+1 (TV channel)|1+1]].
