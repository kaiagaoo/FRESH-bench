politician who is serving as the [[prime minister of Israel]] since 2022, having previously held the office from 1996 to 1999 and from 2009 to 2021. Netanyahu is the [[List of prime ministers of Israel#Term of office in years|longest-serving prime minister]] in Israel's history, having served a total of over 17 years.\n\nBorn to [[secular Jewish]] parents, Netanyahu was raised in [[West Jerusalem]] and the United States. He returned to Israel in 1967 to join the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and served in the [[Sayeret Matkal]] special forces as a [[Israel Defense Forces ranks|captain]] before being honorably discharged. After graduating from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Netanyahu worked for the [[Boston Consulting Group]] and moved back to Israel in 1978 to found the [[Yonatan Netanyahu#The Jonathan Institute|Yonatan Netanyahu Anti-Terror Institute]]. Between 1984 and 1988 Netanyahu was [[Israel's ambassador to the United Nations]]. Netanyahu rose to prominence after [[1993 Likud leadership election|election as chair of Likud in 1993]], becoming [[Leader of the Opposition (Israel)|leader of the opposition]]. In the [[1996 Israeli general election|1996 general election]], Netanyahu became the first Israeli prime minister elected directly by popular vote, and its youngest. Netanyahu was defeated in the [[1999 Israeli general election|1999 election]] and retired from politics, entering the private sector. He returned and served as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|minister of foreign affairs]] and [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|finance]], initiating [[Israeli economy|economic reforms]], before resigning over the [[Gaza disengagement plan]].\n\nNetanyahu [[2005 Likud leadership election|returned to lead Likud in 2005]] and was leader of the opposition between 2006 and 2009. After the [[2009 Israeli legislative election|2009 legislative election]], Netanyahu [[Thirty-second government of Israel|formed a coalition]] with other right-wing parties and became prime minister again. He led Likud to victory in the [[2013 Israeli legislative election|2013]] and [[2015 Israeli legislative election|2015 elections]]. Netanyahu made his closeness to [[Donald Trump]], a friend since the 1980s, central to his appeal from 2016. During [[Trump's first presidency]], the [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel|US recognized Jerusalem as capital of Israel]], [[United States recognition of the Golan Heights as part of Israel|Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights]], and brokered the [[Abraham Accords]], [[Arab\u2013Israeli normalization|normalization agreements]] between Israel and the [[Arab world]]. Netanyahu has faced criticism over expanding [[Israeli settlement]]s in the [[occupied West Bank]], deemed [[International law and Israeli settlements|illegal under international law]]. In 2019, Netanyahu was [[Trial of Benjamin Netanyahu|indicted on charges of breach of trust, bribery and fraud]], and relinquished all ministerial posts except prime minister. The [[2018\u20132022 Israeli political crisis]] led to a [[Rotation government|rotation]] agreement between Netanyahu and [[Benny Gantz]]. This collapsed in 2020, leading to a [[2021 Israeli legislative election|March 2021 election]]. In June 2021, Netanyahu was removed from the premiership, before returning after the [[2022 Israeli legislative election|2022 election]].\n\n[[Thirty-seventh government of Israel|Netanyahu's coalition]] pursued [[2023 Israeli judicial reform|judicial reform]], which was met with large-scale [[2023 Israeli judicial reform protests|protests]] in early 2023. The [[7 October attacks]] by [[Hamas]]-led Palestinian groups in the same year triggered the [[Israel\u2013Hamas war]], with Netanyahu facing [[Israel-Hamas war protests in Israel#\"Bring Them Home Now\" protests|nationwide protests]] for the security lapse during the attack and failure to secure the return of Israeli hostages. In October 2024, he also ordered an [[2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon|invasion of Lebanon]] with the stated goal of destroying the military capabilities of [[Hezbollah]], a key ally of Hamas that [[Israel\u2013Hezbollah conflict (2023\u2013present)|helped]] them since the 7 October attack. After the [[fall of the Assad regime]] in December 2024, Netanyahu directed an [[2024 Israeli invasion of Syria|invasion of Syria]] against the [[Syrian opposition]]. Netanyahu's government has been [[Gaza genocide|accused of genocide]] in Gaza, culminating in the [[South Africa v. Israel (Genocide Convention)|''South Africa v. Israel'']] case before the [[International Court of Justice]] in December 2023. The [[International Criminal Court]] [[International Criminal Court arrest warrants for Israeli figures|issued an arrest warrant]] in November 2024 for Netanyahu along with former Defense Minister [[Yoav Gallant]] and Hamas militant [[Mohammed Deif]], whom Israel presumes dead after [[13 July 2024 al-Mawasi attack|an airstrike]], for [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] as part of the [[International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine#Arrest warrants|ICC investigation in Palestine]].\n\n== Early life and military career ==\n[[File:Netanyahu's military service I.jpg|thumb|upright|left|1967 photograph of Netanyahu by the Israel Defense Forces]]\nNetanyahu was born in 1949 in [[Tel Aviv]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/aboutisrael/state/pages/benjamin%20netanyahu.aspx|title=Benjamin Netanyahu|access-date=16 June 2021|publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606071740/https://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/aboutisrael/state/pages/benjamin%20netanyahu.aspx|archive-date=6 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=13 June 2021|title=Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's unseated long-term leader|language=en-GB|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18008697|access-date=16 June 2021|archive-date=1 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231101050612/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18008697|url-status=live}}</ref> His mother, Tzila Segal (1912\u20132000), was born in [[Petah Tikva]] in the Ottoman Empire's [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]], and his father, [[Warsaw]]-born [[Benzion Netanyahu]] ([[n\u00e9]] Mileikowsky; 1910\u20132012), was a historian specializing in the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jewish Golden age of Spain]].

[[Hamas]] claimed responsibility for most of the bombings. As prime minister, Netanyahu raised many questions about many central premises of the [[Oslo Accords]]. One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the [[status of Jerusalem]], and the amending of the [[Palestinian National Charter]]. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages.

After the [[Shin Bet]] assassinated Hamas military leader [[Yahya Ayyash]] on 5 January 1996, [[Mohammed Deif]], now commander of the [[Qassam Brigades]], organized a mass-casualty bombing campaign inside Israel as retaliation, including the [[Dizengoff Center suicide bombing]] in Tel Aviv and the two [[Jaffa Road bus bombings]] in Jerusalem. These operations were, in their scale, scope and sophistication, different and larger than any attacks of the past, and it has been alleged that both Syria and Iran had helped in their planning and financing. According to a report, [[Syria]]n Minister of Defense [[Mustafa Tlass]] instructed [[Ghazi Kanaan]], the commander of Syrian forces in [[Lebanon]], to establish links between [[Hezbollah]] and Hamas fighters, who were then trained both in Lebanon and in [[Iran]] and participated in the retaliatory operations for the murder of Ayyash.<ref name=meib>{{cite journal|last=Gambill|first=Gary C.|title=Sponsoring Terrorism: Syria and Hamas|journal=Middle East Intelligence Bulletin|date=October 2002|volume=4|issue=10|url=http://www.meforum.org/meib/articles/0210_s1.htm|access-date=7 July 2012|archive-date=5 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191205025415/https://www.meforum.org/meib/articles/0210_s1.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Inquirer|title=Israel Arrests A Hamas Leader Hassan Salameh Was Shot And Wounded In A Chase.

At the beginning of February, Peres was up twenty points in the polls over his opposition, the conservative hawk Benjamin \"Bibi\" Netanyahu. By the middle of March, Netanyahu had closed the gap significantly, and Peres led by only five percentage points. On May 29, Netanyahu won by 1 percent of the vote. This was all due to the terror attacks, which Peres simply couldn't stop. Yahya Ayyash's disciples had ensured the right wing's victory and \"derailed the peace process,\" in the words of the deputy head of the Shin Bet, [[Yisrael Hasson]]. Curiously enough, though, after the election, the attacks stopped for almost a year. Some said this was because of [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]]'s campaign against Hamas, and the arrest of many members of its military wing. Others believed that Hamas no longer had any reason to carry out suicide attacks, because Netanyahu had already almost completely stopped the peace process, which was the short-term goal of the attacks anyway.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Books/Politics/Rise%20and%20Kill%20First%20The%20Secret%20History%20of%20Israel%E2%80%99s%20Targeted%20Assassinations%20by%20Ronen%20Bergman%20%28z-lib.org%29.pdf|title=Rise and Kill First \u2013 The Secret History of Israel's Targeted Assassinations|first=Ronen|last=Bergman|date=2018|translator-first=Ronnie|translator-last=Hope|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9781400069712}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1997 Ali Fallahian, the iranian Intelligence Minister, authorized a new Hamas bombing campaign to further disrupt the peace process, and Hamas leader [[Khaled Meshal]], then living in [[Amman]], Jordan, picked Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, an expert bomb-maker in the [[West Bank]], to construct the bombs, and sent five [[suicide attack|suicide bombers]] to detonate them simultaneously in [[Jerusalem]] on 30 July 1997 ([[1997 Mahane Yehuda Market bombings|Mahane Yehuda market bombings]]) and 4 September 1997 ([[Ben Yehuda Street bombings#1997 (5 killed|Ben Yehuda street bombings)]]), killing 21 Israelis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/stern-v-islamic-republic-of-iran-2|title=Stern v.

At least six other Mossad agents involved in the operations were holed up in the Israeli embassy. [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] would only release them if Israel released [[Ahmed Yassin]] and a large number of other Palestinian prisoners.

His plan involved a move toward more [[Free market|liberalized markets]], although it was not without its critics. He instituted a program to end welfare dependency by requiring people to apply for jobs or training, reduced the size of the public sector, froze government spending for three years, and capped the budget deficit at 1%. The taxation system was streamlined and taxes were cut, with the top individual tax rate reduced from 64% to 44% and the corporate tax rate from 36% to 18%. A host of state assets worth billions of dollars were privatized, including banks, oil refineries, the [[El Al]] national airline, and [[Zim Integrated Shipping Services]]. The retirement ages for both men and women were raised, and currency exchange laws were further liberalized. Commercial banks were forced to spin off their long-term savings.

He identifies terrorism as a form of [[totalitarianism]], writing: <blockquote>The more far removed the target of the attack from any connection to the grievance enunciated by the terrorists, the greater the terror&nbsp;... Yet for terrorism to have any impact, it is precisely the lack of connection, the lack of any possible involvement or \"complicity\" of the chosen victims in the cause the terrorists seek to attack, that produces the desired fear. For terrorism's underlying message is that every member of society is \"guilty\", that anyone can be a victim, and that therefore no one is safe... In fact, the methods reveal the totalitarian strain that runs through all terrorist groups... It is not only that the ends of the terrorists do not succeed in justifying the means they choose; their choice of means indicate what their true ends are. Far from being fighters for freedom, terrorists are the forerunners of tyranny.
