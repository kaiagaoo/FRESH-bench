Macron is ''ex officio'' one of the two [[Co-Princes of Andorra]]. He previously was [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (France)|Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs]] under President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] from 2014 to 2016, and as Deputy Secretary-General to the President from 2012 to 2014. He is a founding member of [[Renaissance (French political party)|Renaissance]].\n\nBorn in [[Amiens]], Macron studied philosophy at [[Paris Nanterre University]], later completing a master's degree in public affairs at [[Sciences Po]] and graduating from the [[\u00c9cole nationale d'administration]] in 2004. He worked as a senior civil servant at the [[Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des finances (France)|Inspectorate General of Finances]] and later became an [[investment banker]] at [[Rothschild & Co]].\n\nAppointed [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace|\u00c9lys\u00e9e]] deputy secretary-general by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] shortly after [[2012 French presidential election|his election]] in May 2012, Macron was one of Hollande's senior advisers. Appointed Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs in August 2014 in the [[second Valls government]], he led a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned in August 2016, in order to launch his 2017 presidential campaign. A member of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of [[Renaissance (French political party)|En Marche]], a centrist and [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] political movement he founded in April 2016.\n\nPartly as a result of the [[Fillon affair]] which sank the [[The Republicans (France)|Republican]] nominee [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]]'s chances, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating [[Marine Le Pen]] of the [[National Rally|National Front]]. At the age of 39, he became the youngest president in French history. In the [[2017 French legislative election|2017 legislative election]] in June, his party, renamed La R\u00e9publique En Marche! (LREM), secured a majority in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]. He appointed [[\u00c9douard Philippe]] as prime minister. When Philippe resigned in 2020, Macron appointed [[Jean Castex]] to replace him.\n\nMacron was elected to a second term in the [[2022 French presidential election|2022 presidential election]], again defeating Le Pen, thus becoming the first French presidential candidate to win reelection since [[Jacques Chirac]] defeated [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in [[2002 French presidential election|2002]]. However, in the [[2022 French legislative election|2022 legislative election]], his [[Ensemble (coalition)|centrist coalition]] lost its absolute majority, resulting in a [[hung parliament]] and the formation of France's first [[minority government]] since the fall of the [[Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy|B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy]] government in [[1993 French legislative elections|1993]]. Macron's current prime minister is [[\u00c9lisabeth Borne]], the second female head of government in French history, whom he appointed in May 2022 to replace Castex. He has reshuffled the current [[Borne government|cabinet]] twice since its formation: first in [[July 2022 French government reshuffle|July 2022]], and then again in [[2023 French government reshuffle|July 2023]].\n\nDuring his presidency, Macron has overseen several reforms to [[French labour law|labour laws]], [[Taxation in France|taxation]], and [[Pensions in France|pensions]]; and has pursued a [[renewable energy transition]]. Dubbed \"president of the rich\" by political opponents, increasing [[Protests against Emmanuel Macron|protests]] against his domestic reforms and demanding his resignation marked the first years of his presidency, culminating in 2018\u20132020 with the [[yellow vests protests]] and the [[2019\u20132020 French pension reform strike|pension reform strike]]. From 2020, he led France's response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in France|COVID-19 pandemic]] and [[COVID-19 vaccination in France|vaccination rollout]]. In 2023, the government of his prime minister, [[\u00c9lisabeth Borne]], passed [[2023 French pension reform bill|legislation raising the retirement age from 62 to 64]]; the pension reforms proved controversial and led to [[2023 French pension reform strikes|public sector strikes and violent protests]]. In foreign policy, he called for reforms to the [[European Union]] (EU) and signed bilateral treaties with [[Quirinal Treaty|Italy]] and [[Aachen Treaty|Germany]]. Macron conducted \u20ac42 billion in trade and business agreements with China during the [[China\u2013United States trade war]] and oversaw a dispute with Australia and the United States over the [[AUKUS]] security pact. He continued [[Op\u00e9ration Chammal]] in the [[war against the Islamic State]] and joined in the [[Government and intergovernmental reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine|international condemnation]] of the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]].\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early life==\nMacron was born on 21 December 1977 in [[Amiens]].
