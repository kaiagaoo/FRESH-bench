''Ex officio'', he is also one of the two [[Co-Princes of Andorra]]. Prior to his presidency, Macron served as [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (France)|Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs]] under President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] between 2014 and 2016.\n\nBorn in [[Amiens]], he studied philosophy at [[Paris Nanterre University]], later completing a master's degree in public affairs at [[Sciences Po]] and graduating from the [[\u00c9cole nationale d'administration]] in 2004. Macron worked as a senior civil servant at the [[Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des finances (France)|Inspectorate General of Finances]] and later became an [[investment banker]] at [[Rothschild & Co]].\n\nMacron was appointed [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace|\u00c9lys\u00e9e]] deputy secretary-general by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] shortly after [[2012 French presidential election|his election]] in May 2012, making him one of Hollande's senior advisers. He was appointed to the [[Government of France|Government]] of Prime Minister [[Manuel Valls]] as Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs in August 2014. In this role, Macron championed a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned in August 2016, launching a campaign for the 2017 presidential election. Although Macron had been a member of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of [[Renaissance (French political party)|En Marche]], a centrist and [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] political movement he founded in April 2016.\n\nPartly thanks to the [[Fillon affair]] which sank [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] nominee [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]], Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, before he was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating [[Marine Le Pen]] of the [[National Rally|National Front]]. At the age of 39, Macron became the youngest president in French history. In the [[2017 French legislative election|2017 legislative election]] in June, Macron's party, renamed La R\u00e9publique En Marche! (LREM), secured a majority in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]. He appointed [[\u00c9douard Philippe]] as prime minister until his resignation in 2020, when he appointed [[Jean Castex]]. Macron was elected to a second term in the [[2022 French presidential election|2022 presidential election]], again defeating Le Pen, thus becoming the first French presidential candidate to win reelection since [[Jacques Chirac]] in [[2002 French presidential election|2002]].<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Spencer |first1=Mimosa |last2=Jabkhiro |first2=Juliette |last3=Foroudi |first3=Layli |date=2022-04-24 |title=France's Macron beats Le Pen to win second term |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/macron-or-le-pen-france-faces-stark-choice-president-2022-04-24/ |access-date=2022-04-24}}</ref> However, in the [[2022 French legislative election|2022 legislative election]], his [[Ensemble (coalition)|political coalition]] lost its absolute majority, resulting in a [[hung parliament]].\n\nDuring his presidency, Macron has overseen several reforms to [[French labour law|labour laws]], [[Taxation in France|taxation]] and [[Pensions in France|pensions]]; he has pursued a [[renewable energy transition]]. Dubbed \"president of the rich\" by political opponents,<ref name=wealthtax/> increasing [[Protests against Emmanuel Macron|protests]] against his domestic reforms and demanding his resignation marked the first years of his presidency, culminating in 2018\u20132019 with the [[yellow vests protests]] and the [[2019\u20132020 French pension reform strike|pension reform strike]]. From 2020, he led France's response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in France|COVID-19 pandemic]] and [[COVID-19 vaccination in France|vaccination rollout]]. In foreign policy, he called for reforms to the [[European Union]] (EU) and signed bilateral treaties with [[Quirinal Treaty|Italy]] and [[Aachen Treaty|Germany]]. Macron conducted $45-billion trade and business agreements with China during the [[China\u2013United States trade war]] and oversaw a dispute with Australia and the United States over the [[AUKUS]] security pact. He continued [[Op\u00e9ration Chammal]] in the [[war against the Islamic State]] and joined in the international condemnation of the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]].\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early life==\nMacron was born on 21 December 1977 in [[Amiens]].
