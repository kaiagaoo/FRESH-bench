Regarding [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|existential risk from artificial intelligence]], Hinton typically declines to make predictions more than five years into the future, noting that exponential progress makes the uncertainty too great.<ref> name=\"fogofprogress\">{{cite web|last1=Hinton|first1=Geoffrey|title=Lecture 16d The fog of progress|url=https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/coursera/lecture16/lec16.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHinton is optimistic about AI\u2019s impact on the job market: \u201cThe phrase \u2018artificial general intelligence\u2019 carries with it the implication that this sort of single robot is suddenly going to be smarter than you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that. I think more and more of the routine things we do are going to be replaced by AI systems \u2014 like the Google Assistant.\u201d <ref>{{cite web |title=Geoffrey Hinton and Demis Hassabis: AGI is nowhere close to being a reality |url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/17/geoffrey-hinton-and-demis-hassabis-agi-is-nowhere-close-to-being-a-reality/ |website=venturebeat|date=17 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nHinton argues that AGI won\u2019t make humans redundant. Rather, he says, it will remain for the most part myopic in its understanding of the world \u2014 at least in the near future. He believes that it\u2019ll continue to improve our lives in small but meaningful ways. \u201c[AI in the future is] going to know a lot about what you\u2019re probably going to want to do and how to do it, and it\u2019s going to be very helpful. But it\u2019s not going to replace you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you took [a] system that was developed to be able to be very good [at driving], and you sent it on its first date, I think it would be a disaster.\u201d And for dangerous tasks currently performed by humans, that\u2019s a step in the right direction, according to Hinton. <ref>{{cite web |title=Geoffrey Hinton and Demis Hassabis: AGI is nowhere close to being a reality |url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/17/geoffrey-hinton-and-demis-hassabis-agi-is-nowhere-close-to-being-a-reality/ |website=venturebeat|date=17 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Scholia|author}}\n\n{{FRS 1998}}\n{{Turing Award laureates}}\n{{Princess of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research}}\n{{Differentiable computing}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hinton, Geoffrey}}\n[[Category:Artificial intelligence researchers]]\n[[Category:British computer scientists]]\n[[Category:Canadian computer scientists]]\n[[Category:Companions of the Order of Canada]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Google employees]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Machine learning researchers]]\n[[Category:University of Toronto faculty]]\n[[Category:Canada Research Chairs]]\n[[Category:1947 births]]\n[[Category:Carnegie Mellon University faculty]]\n[[Category:Rumelhart Prize laureates]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Cognitive Science Society]]\n[[Category:Turing Award laureates]]\n[[Category:People from Wimbledon, London]]\n[[Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Engineering]]\n[[Category:Hinton family]]\n[[Category:Canadian Fellows of the Royal Society]]"}
