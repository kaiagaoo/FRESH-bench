Hamilton series}}\n\n'''Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton''' (born 7 January 1985) is a British [[racing driver]], who most recently competed in [[Formula One]] for [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]].<!--Only change to set to compete for Ferrari from 1 January 2025--> Hamilton has won a joint-record seven [[Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles]]\u2014tied with [[Michael Schumacher]]\u2014and holds the [[List of Formula One driver records|records]] for most [[List of Formula One Grand Prix winners|wins]] ({{F1stat|HAM|wins}}), [[List of Formula One polesitters|pole positions]] ({{F1stat|HAM|poles}}), and [[List of Formula One driver records#Total podium finishes|podium finishes]] ({{F1stat|HAM|podiums}}), among [[List of career achievements by Lewis Hamilton#Records|others]].\n\nBorn and raised in [[Stevenage]], Hamilton began his career in [[kart racing|karting]] aged six, winning several national titles and attracting the attention of [[Ron Dennis]], who signed him to the [[McLaren Young Driver Programme|McLaren-Mercedes Young Driver Programme]] in 1998. After winning the [[KF1|direct-drive]] [[Karting World Cup]] and [[Karting European Championship|European Championship]] in 2000, Hamilton progressed to [[formula racing|junior formulae]], where his successes included winning the [[2005 Formula 3 Euro Series|Formula 3 Euro Series]] and the [[2006 GP2 Series|GP2 Series]]. He subsequently signed for [[McLaren]] in {{F1|2007}}, becoming the first [[Black people|black]] driver to compete in Formula One at the {{F1GP|2007|Australian}}. In his rookie season, Hamilton won four [[Formula One Grands Prix|Grands Prix]] and set several records as he finished runner-up to [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] by one point. Hamilton won his maiden title in {{F1|2008}}, making a title-deciding overtake on the last lap of the [[2008 Brazilian Grand Prix|last race of the season]] to become the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions#Youngest Drivers' Champion|then-youngest World Drivers' Champion]]. The dominant [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]]-[[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] combination prevailed throughout his remaining four seasons at McLaren, with Hamilton achieving multiple race wins in each, including his involvement in a four-way title battle in {{F1|2010}}.\n\nHamilton signed for [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] in {{F1|2013}} to partner [[Nico Rosberg]], ending his 15-year association with McLaren. Following his maiden victory with the team at the [[2013 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]], new [[Turbo-hybrid engines (Formula One, 2014\u20132021)|engine regulations]] came into effect the [[2014 Formula One season|following season]], which saw Mercedes emerge as the dominant force in Formula One. Over the next three seasons, Hamilton and Rosberg won 51 of 59 Grands Prix amidst their [[Hamilton\u2013Rosberg rivalry|fierce rivalry]]\u2014widely known as ''The [[Silver Arrows|Silver]] War''\u2014with Hamilton winning the former titles in {{F1|2014}} and {{F1|2015}}, and Rosberg winning [[2016 Formula One season|the latter]]. After Rosberg's retirement, Hamilton twice overturned mid-season point deficits to [[Sebastian Vettel]] of [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] to claim his fourth and fifth titles in {{F1|2017}} and {{F1|2018}}. Hamilton won his sixth title in {{F1|2019}}, before breaking several records across his {{F1|2020}} campaign\u2014including the all-time win record at the {{F1GP|2020|Portuguese}}\u2014to equal [[Michael Schumacher]]'s record of seven World Drivers' Championships. Hamilton became the first driver to surpass 100 race wins and pole positions in {{F1|2021}}, finishing runner-up to [[Max Verstappen]] amidst a [[2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix#Safety car controversy|controversial finish]]. Following winless campaigns in {{F1|2022}} and {{F1|2023}}, Hamilton took his record-breaking ninth {{F1GP|2024|British}} victory in {{F1|2024}}, his twelfth and final season with Mercedes. Hamilton is set to join Ferrari from {{F1|2025}} onwards.\n\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, amongst his environmental and social activism. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of [[racial justice]] and increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was listed in the 2020 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people globally]], and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2021 New Year Honours]].\n{{TOClimit|4}}\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Hamilton and Father Brazil 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Hamilton celebrating with his father and then-manager Anthony Hamilton after the [[2008 Brazilian Grand Prix]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Anthony Hamilton's massive support makes parting with Lewis easier to understand|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/lewishamilton/7355036/Anthony-Hamiltons-massive-support-makes-parting-with-Lewis-easier-to-understand.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/lewishamilton/7355036/Anthony-Hamiltons-massive-support-makes-parting-with-Lewis-easier-to-understand.html |archive-date=10 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|work=The Daily Telegraph |date=3 March 2010|access-date=14 May 2010|location=London|first=Tom|last=Cary}}{{cbignore}}</ref>|left]]\nLewis Carl Davidson Hamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in [[Stevenage]], [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=\"Hamilton\">{{cite book|title=Lewis Hamilton: My Story|last=Hamilton|first=Lewis|isbn=978-0-00-727005-7|page=33|publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperSport]]|year=2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Kelso\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/20/paulkelso.uknews4|title=Profile: Lewis Hamilton|last=Kelso|first=Paul|date=20 April 2007|work=The Guardian |access-date=26 June 2008|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005142006/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/20/paulkelso.uknews4|archive-date=5 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> His father, Anthony Hamilton, is of [[Afro-Grenadians|Afro-Grenadian]] descent, while his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is [[White British]] from [[Birmingham]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=FreeBMD Entry Info|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r=212152514:9565&d=bmd_1637027742|access-date=12 December 2021|website=freebmd.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211212190025/https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r=212152514:9565&d=bmd_1637027742|archive-date=12 December 2021|url-status=dead}}</ref> making him [[Mixed (United Kingdom ethnicity category)|mixed-race]].<ref name=\"Wolff\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewishamilton.com/post/first-black-driver/|title=Being F1's first black driver is important|website=lewishamilton.com|access-date=7 March 2018|archive-date=8 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041330/http://www.lewishamilton.com/post/first-black-driver/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Hamilton's parents separated when he was two, after which he lived with his mother and older half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve.<ref name=\"DSpyHamilton\">{{cite web|last=Math\u00e9|first=Charlotte|title=10 Things About ...
