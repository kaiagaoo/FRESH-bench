He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in [[2008\u201309 FC Barcelona season|2008\u201309]] he helped Barcelona achieve the first [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first [[2009 Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]]. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the [[2011\u201312 FC Barcelona season|2011\u201312 season]], he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics#Top goalscorers|Barcelona's all-time top scorer]].

Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record [[2019 Ballon d'Or|sixth Ballon d'Or]] in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.\n\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the country's [[Argentina national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]] and also holds the [[Argentina national football team#Most capped players|national record for appearances]]. At youth level, he won the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]], finishing the tournament with both the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball and Golden Shoe]], and an [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]]. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbler]] drew comparisons with his compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who described Messi as [[New Maradona|his successor]]. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a [[FIFA World Cup]] ([[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]]), and reached the final of the [[2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], for which he won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]], the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], winning the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica#Awards|Golden Ball]], and the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario|2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica]]. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], a third-place finish at the [[2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], and victory in the [[2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], while winning the [[2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica#Awards|Golden Ball]] and [[Copa Am\u00e9rica records and statistics|Golden Boot]] for the latter. For this achievement, Messi received a record-extending [[2021 Ballon d'Or|seventh Ballon d'Or]] in 2021. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, became the first player to score in every stage of a World Cup (including two in [[2022 FIFA World Cup final|the final]]), and broke the record for [[List of players who have appeared in the most FIFA World Cups|most appearances in World Cup tournaments]] with 26 matches played.\n\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company [[Adidas]] since 2006. According to ''[[France Football]]'', he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the [[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes|world's highest-paid athlete]] by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2019 and 2022.

Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent ''La Albiceleste'' since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the [[Argentine Football Association]] organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in [[FIFA]]. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8\u20130 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the [[2005 South American U-20 Championship|South American Youth Championship]], held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2\u20131 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship|FIFA World Youth Championship]].{{sfn|Balagu\u00e9|2013|pp=209\u2013219}}\n\nAware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1\u20130 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2\u20131 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.{{sfn|Balagu\u00e9|2013|pp=220\u2013240}}<ref name=\"MagicMessi\">{{cite web |title=Magic Messi Sparks High Drama in the Lowlands |publisher=FIFA |date=July 2005 |url=https://www.fifa.com/u20worldcup/news/y=2007/m=3/news=magic-messi-sparks-high-drama-the-lowlands-501784.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906082949/http://www.fifa.com/u20worldcup/news/y=2007/m=3/news=magic-messi-sparks-high-drama-the-lowlands-501784.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 September 2015 |access-date=12 August 2015}}</ref> His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the [[1979 FIFA World Youth Championship|title in 1979]].<ref name=\"MagicMessi\" />\n\n=== 2005\u20132006: Senior and World Cup debuts ===\nIn recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager [[Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman]] gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 17 August 2005.
