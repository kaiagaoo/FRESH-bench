A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi has scored over [[List of footballers with 500 or more goals|850 senior career goals]] for club and country.\n\nBorn in [[Rosario]], Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, and made his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in [[2008\u201309 FC Barcelona season|2008\u201309]] helped Barcelona achieve the first [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won the [[2009 Ballon d'Or|first]] of his four consecutive Ballons d'Or, the first player to win it four times. During the [[2011\u201312 FC Barcelona season|2011\u201312 season]], he set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season, while establishing himself as [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics#Top goalscorers|Barcelona's all-time top scorer]]. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], his perceived [[Messi\u2013Ronaldo rivalry|career rival]], before regaining his best form during the [[2014\u201315 FC Barcelona season|2014\u201315 campaign]], where he became the all-time top scorer in La Liga, led Barcelona to a historic second treble, and won a fifth Ballon d'Or in [[2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2015]]. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in [[2019 Ballon d'Or|2019]]. During his overall tenure at Barcelona, Messi won a [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics#Other individual records for the club|club-record]] 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues, among others. He signed for French club [[Paris Saint-Germain]] in August 2021, where he would win the [[Ligue 1]] title during both of his seasons there. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, and set a new mark for [[List of Inter Miami CF records and statistics|most goals scored for the club]] by his second season.\n\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the national team's [[Argentina national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]] and [[Argentina national football team#Most-capped players|most-capped player]]. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbler]] drew career-long comparisons with compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who described Messi as [[New Maradona|his successor]]. At the youth level, he won the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]] and [[Olympic medal|gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]]. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a World Cup in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]]. He assumed the national team's captaincy in 2011, and then led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] and the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario]], all of which they would lose. After initially announcing his international retirement in 2016, he returned to help his country narrowly qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], which they would again exit early. Messi and the national team finally broke Argentina's 28-year trophy drought with a victory in the [[2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], where he was named the tournament's best player and which later helped him win his seventh Ballon d'Or [[2021 Ballon d'Or|that year]]. He then led Argentina to win the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], his country's third overall world championship and first in 36 years. This followed with a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in [[2023 Ballon d'Or|2023]]. A second Copa Am\u00e9rica victory with Messi as captain came in [[2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2024]].\n\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company [[Adidas]] since 2006. According to ''[[France Football]]'', he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the [[Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes|world's highest-paid athlete]] by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year|Laureus World Sportsman of the Year]], the first team-sport athlete to win it.
