AI\u2019s influence continues to grow, but representation and inclusion of a diversity of researchers in the field does not. It\u2019s critical that we seize this moment to create structures that will support long-term, positive changes. This won\u2019t happen via a single mechanism or quick fix. It starts with early education and extends to the existing structures of power within academia, work cultures among current AI researchers, and gatekeeping functions of research publishing, to name a few levers of change.\n|author=Fei-Fei Li and [[Tess Posner]]\n|source=Nature<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Posner|first1=Tess|last2=Fei-Fei|first2=Li|date=2020-12-09|title=AI will change the world, so it's time to change AI|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03412-z|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=588|issue=7837|pages=S118|doi=10.1038/d41586-020-03412-z|bibcode=2020Natur.588S.118P|s2cid=228087170}}</ref>\n}}\n\nLi has been described as a \"researcher bringing humanity to AI.\"<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/story/wired25-kai-fu-lee-fei-fei-li-artificial-intelligence/|title=An AI Pioneer, and the Researcher Bringing Humanity to AI|magazine=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nLi was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2021,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.stanford.edu/today/2021/04/22/newest-american-academy-arts-sciences-members/|title=Ten Stanford faculty members elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|website=AAAS at Stanford|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref> the National Academy of Engineering in 2020,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chemistry.stanford.edu/news/three-stanford-faculty-elected-national-academy-engineering|title=Three Stanford faculty elected to the National Academy of Engineering {{!}} Department of Chemistry|website=chemistry.stanford.edu|date=February 10, 2020 |access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref> and the National Academy of Medicine in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/10/five-professors-elected-to-national-academy-of-medicine.html|title=Five professors elected to National Academy of Medicine|website=NAM at Stanford|date=November 18, 2019 |access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===Research===\nLi works on artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[computational neuroscience]].
