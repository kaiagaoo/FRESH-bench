Two years later, he matriculated at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] and transferred to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend [[Stanford University]]. After two days, he dropped out and with his brother [[Kimbal Musk|Kimbal]], co-founded the online [[city guide]] software company [[Zip2]]. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by [[Compaq]] for $307 million and Musk co-founded [[X.com]], a [[direct bank]]. X.com merged with [[Confinity]] in 2000 to form [[PayPal]], which [[eBay]] acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002.\n\nWith $175.8&nbsp;million, Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, a [[spaceflight]] services company. In 2004, he was an early investor in the [[electric vehicle]] manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create [[SolarCity]], a solar energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became [[Tesla Energy]]. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit [[artificial intelligence]] research company. The following year, he co-founded Neuralink\u2014a [[neurotechnology]] company developing [[brain\u2013computer interfaces]]\u2014and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has also proposed a [[hyperloop]] high-speed [[vactrain]] transportation system. In 2022, [[acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk|his acquisition of Twitter]] for $44 billion was completed. \n\nMusk has made controversial statements on politics and technology, particularly on Twitter, and is a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including spreading [[COVID-19 misinformation]]. In 2018, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) sued Musk for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. Musk stepped down as chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine as part of a settlement agreement with the SEC.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood and family===\n{{Further|Musk family}}\nElon Reeve
