Two years later, he [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at [[Queen's University at Kingston]] in Canada. Musk later transferred to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend [[Stanford University]], but dropped out after two days and, with his brother [[Kimbal Musk|Kimbal]], co-founded online [[city guide]] software company [[Zip2]]. The startup was acquired by [[Compaq]] for $307 million in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded [[X.com (bank)|X.com]], a [[direct bank]]. X.com merged with [[Confinity]] in 2000 to form [[PayPal]]. In October 2002, [[eBay]] acquired PayPal for $1.5&nbsp;billion. Using $100&nbsp;million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a [[spaceflight]] services company, in 2002. \n\nIn 2004, Musk became an early investor in [[electric vehicle]] manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.). He became the company's chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create [[SolarCity]], a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became [[Tesla Energy]]. In 2013, he proposed a [[hyperloop]] high-speed [[vactrain]] transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit [[artificial intelligence]] research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink\u2014a [[neurotechnology]] company developing [[brain\u2013computer interfaces]]\u2014and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case, Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he [[acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk|acquired Twitter]] for $44&nbsp;billion. He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial intelligence company.\n\n[[Views of Elon Musk|Musk has expressed views]] that have made him a polarizing figure.<ref name=\"Trouble\">{{Cite web
