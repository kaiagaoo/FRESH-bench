McConnell has been the leader of the [[Senate Republican Conference]] since 2007, including as majority leader from 2015 to 2021, making him the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history.\n\nMcConnell holds [[Conservatism|conservative]] political positions, although he was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] Republican early in his political career. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'', which partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives during the [[Obama administration]], making frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of President [[Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]].\n\nDuring the [[First presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]], the Senate Republican majority under McConnell's leadership passed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], the [[Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act]] in 2018, the [[First Step Act]], and the [[Great American Outdoors Act]], and confirmed a record number of [[federal appeals court]] judges during a president's first two years.  McConnell invoked the [[nuclear option]] to eliminate the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, after his predecessor [[Harry Reid]] had eliminated the filibuster for all other [[Presidential nominee|presidential nominations]]; Trump subsequently won Supreme Court confirmation battles over [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]] and [[Amy Coney Barrett]]. While supportive of most of Trump's domestic and foreign policies, McConnell criticized Trump's [[attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election|attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election]], and despite voting to acquit in [[Trump's second impeachment trial]] for reasons related to the constitutionality of impeaching a former president, deemed him \"practically and morally responsible\" for the [[January 6 United States Capitol attack]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=McConnell says Trump was \"practically and morally responsible\" for riot after voting not guilty|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-trump-impeachment-vote-senate-speech/|access-date=May 12, 2021|website=cbsnews.com|date=February 14, 2021|language=en-US|archive-date=February 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210216230659/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-trump-impeachment-vote-senate-speech/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, 2019 and 2023, ''Time'' listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.<ref name=\"Boehner\">{{cite news |last=Boehner |first=John |date=April 16, 2015 |title=Mitch McConnell |url=https://time.com/collection-post/3822824/mitch-mcconnell-2015-time-100/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106202345/https://time.com/collection-post/3822824/mitch-mcconnell-2015-time-100/ |archive-date=November 6, 2020 |access-date=September 18, 2020 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Time\">{{Cite magazine |title=Mitch McConnell: The 100 Most Influential People of 2019 |url=https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567755/mitch-mcconnell/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112004253/https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567755/mitch-mcconnell/ |archive-date=November 12, 2020 |access-date=November 7, 2020 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> On February 28, 2024, McConnell announced that he would step down as the Senate Republican Conference Leader in January 2025, but would serve the remainder of his Senate term.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tackett |first=Michael |date=February 28, 2024 |title=McConnell will step down as the Senate Republican leader in November after a record run in the job |url=https://apnews.com/article/mitch-mcconnell-senate-republican-leader-stepping-down-ba478d570a4561aa7baf91a204d7e366 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240228174438/https://apnews.com/article/mitch-mcconnell-senate-republican-leader-stepping-down-ba478d570a4561aa7baf91a204d7e366 |archive-date=February 28, 2024 |access-date=February 28, 2024 |publisher=Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Mangan |first=Dan |date=February 28, 2024 |title=Mitch McConnell to step down as Republican Senate leader in November: Report |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/mitch-mcconnell-to-step-down-as-republican-senate-leader-in-november-report.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240228181324/https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/mitch-mcconnell-to-step-down-as-republican-senate-leader-in-november-report.html |archive-date=February 28, 2024 |accessdate=February 28, 2024 |publisher=CNBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hughes |first1=Siobhan |date=February 28, 2024 |title=Mitch McConnell to Step Down as Senate Minority Leader in November |url=https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/mitch-mcconnell-to-step-down-as-senate-minority-leader-in-november-7e9ca478 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240228223725/https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/mitch-mcconnell-to-step-down-as-senate-minority-leader-in-november-7e9ca478 |archive-date=February 28, 2024 |access-date=February 28, 2024 |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=News Corp}}</ref> [[2024 Senate Republican Conference leadership election|An internal election]] to fill the post of Senate Republican Leader was held on November 13, in which South Dakota senator [[John Thune]] was selected.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Jalonick and Groves |first=Mary Clare and Stephen |date=November 13, 2024 |title=Republican John Thune of South Dakota is elected the next Senate majority leader |url=https://apnews.com/article/senate-leader-thune-cornyn-scott-mcconnell-trump-c3c1c451a420729136ae641a14d9d5d6 |access-date=November 13, 2024 |work=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education (1942\u20131967)==\nMcConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene \"Dean\" ({{nee}} Shockley) and Addison Mitchell \"A.M.\" McConnell II<ref name=\"memoir\">{{Cite book |title=The Long Game: a Memoir |last=McConnell |first=Mitch |publisher=Sentinel |year=2016 |isbn=9780399564123 |location=New York, NY |chapter=Chapter One: A fighting spirit |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cO3CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |page=9 |quote=She'd been known her whole life not by her first name, Julia, which she loved, but by her middle name, Odene, which she detested.
