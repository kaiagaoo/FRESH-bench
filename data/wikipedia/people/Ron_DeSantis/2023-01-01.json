A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], DeSantis represented Florida's [[Florida's 6th congressional district|6th district]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from 2013 to 2018.\n\nBorn in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], DeSantis spent most of his childhood in [[Dunedin, Florida]]. He graduated from [[Yale University]] and [[Harvard Law School]]. DeSantis joined the [[United States Navy]] in 2004 and was promoted to [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] before serving as a legal advisor to [[SEAL Team One]]; he was [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|deployed to Iraq in 2007]]. When he returned to the U.S. a year later, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] appointed DeSantis to serve as a [[Assistant United States Attorney|Special Assistant U.S. attorney]] at the [[U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida]], a position he held until his honorable discharge in 2010.\n\nDeSantis was first elected to Congress in [[2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Florida|2012]], defeating his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent Heather Beaven. During his tenure he became a founding member of the [[Freedom Caucus]] and was an ally of President [[Donald Trump]]. DeSantis frequently criticized Special Counsel [[Robert Mueller]]'s investigation into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference]] in the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]]. He briefly ran for [[U.S. Senate]] in [[2016 United States Senate election in Florida|2016]], but withdrew when incumbent senator [[Marco Rubio]] sought reelection.\n\nIn August 2018, DeSantis won the Republican nomination [[2018 Florida gubernatorial election|for governor]], and chose state representative [[Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez]] as his running mate. The close results of the general election between DeSantis and the Democratic nominee, [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] mayor [[Andrew Gillum]], triggered a machine recount. DeSantis was certified the winner with a 0.4% margin of victory.\n\nAs governor, DeSantis resisted imposing restrictions during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Florida]], including [[Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|face mask mandates]], [[COVID-19 lockdowns|stay-at-home orders]], and [[COVID-19 vaccination mandates in the United States|vaccination requirements]]. In May 2021, he signed into law a bill that prohibited businesses, schools, cruise ships, and government entities from requiring proof of vaccination.<!-- \"https://writingexplained.org/ap-style/ap-style-governor\" should be lowercase per MOS:JOBTITLES, kindly get consensus on talk page if you feel otherwise. --> DeSantis cut spending in Florida, achieving a record budget surplus for the state, and engaged in recovery efforts after [[Hurricane Ian]] and [[Hurricane Nicole (2022)|Hurricane Nicole]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Moran |first=Danielle |date=July 7, 2022 |title=Florida Posts $21.8 Billion Budget Surplus, a State Record |work=Bloomberg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-07/florida-posts-21-8-billion-budget-surplus-a-state-record}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Sivco |first=Katie |date=October 6, 2022 |title=Biden praises DeSantis' response to Hurricane Ian |work=WESH.com |url=https://www.wesh.com/article/biden-desantis-response-hurricane-ian/41537029#}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Contorno |first=Steve |date=October 8, 2022 |title=Democrats were already struggling in Florida.
