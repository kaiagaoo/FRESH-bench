She has a career-high ranking of world No. 4 in singles, reached on October 24, 2022, and [[List of WTA number 1 ranked doubles tennis players|world No. 1]] in doubles, achieved on August 15, 2022. Gauff won her first [[WTA Tour]] singles title at the [[2019 Upper Austria Ladies Linz \u2013 Singles|2019 Linz Open]] aged 15 years and 7 months, making her the youngest singles title-holder on the Tour since 2004. She has won three WTA Tour singles titles and eight doubles titles \u2013 three partnering with [[Caty McNally]] and five with [[Jessica Pegula]]. Gauff rose to prominence with a win over former World No. 1 and seven-time Grand Slam champion [[Venus Williams]] in the opening round of [[2019 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's singles|2019 Wimbledon]].\n\nBorn to parents with [[NCAA Division I]] collegiate backgrounds in basketball and track and field, Gauff experimented with a variety of sports as a child. She chose tennis, inspired by the [[Williams sisters]] and preferring an individual sport.\n\nGauff had success as a junior, earning a sponsorship to train at [[Patrick Mouratoglou]]'s academy in France. She began playing on the [[ITF Junior Circuit]] at 13 and finished runner-up at the junior [[2017 US Open \u2013 Girls' singles|2017 US Open]] in just her fourth ITF event, the youngest finalist in the tournament's history. She became the No. 1 junior in the world after winning the junior [[2018 French Open \u2013 Girls' singles|2018 French Open]] singles title over McNally. She also won a junior Grand Slam doubles title at the [[2018 US Open \u2013 Girls' doubles|2018 US Open]], this time partnering McNally.\n\nGauff made her WTA Tour debut in March 2019 at the [[2019 Miami Open \u2013 Women's singles|Miami Open]] and won her opening match. She received a wild card into the qualifying draw at the 2019 Wimbledon Championships, where she became the youngest player in the tournament's history to qualify for the main draw. There she reached the fourth round, and each of her matches was the most-watched of the day through the first week of television coverage in the United States. Later that summer, still aged 15, she reached the third round of the [[2019 US Open \u2013 Women's singles|US Open]]. In 2021, she reached her first major final in women's doubles at the [[2021 US Open \u2013 Women's doubles|US Open]], and reached her first major singles final at the [[2022 French Open \u2013 Women's singles|2022 French Open]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Early life==\nGauff was born on March 13, 2004, to Candi ({{Nee|Odom}})<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heavy.com/sports/2019/07/coco-gauff-mother-candi-mom/|title=Candi Gauff, Coco Gauff's Mother: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|last=McBride|first=Jessica|date=July 8, 2019|website=Heavy|language=en|access-date=July 10, 2019}}</ref> and Corey Gauff, both of whom are from [[Delray Beach, Florida|Delray Beach]], Florida.<ref name=\"delray-beach\">{{cite web |last1=Persak |first1=Mike |title=Delray's Coco Gauff, 14, stays grounded with family after winning French Open girls' title |url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/tennis/fl-sp-tennis-coco-gauff-20180618-story.html |website=Sun-Sentinel |access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/wimbledon-wunderkind-cori-coco-gauff/|title=So who is Wimbledon wunderkind, Cori 'Coco' Gauff?|last=Cohen|first=Claire|date=July 3, 2019|website=The Telegraph|access-date=July 10, 2019}}</ref> She has two younger brothers, Codey who is four years younger and Cameron who is nine years younger.<ref name=\"nyt-ten\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/sports/tennis/cori-gauff-facts-bio-history.html|title=Cori Gauff: 10 Things to Know About the Newest Tennis Phenom|last1=Rothenberg|first1=Ben|website=New York Times|date=July 3, 2019|access-date=July 7, 2019}}</ref> Her father played college basketball at [[Georgia State University]] and later worked as a health care executive, while her mother was a track and field athlete at [[Florida State University]] and worked as an educator.<ref name=\"undefeated\">{{cite web |last1=Bembry |first1=Jerry |title=Coco Gauff and family following familiar path to greatness |url=https://andscape.com/features/coco-gauff-and-family-following-familiar-path-to-greatness/ |website=[[Andscape]] |date=July 5, 2019 |access-date=July 7, 2019}}</ref> Gauff grew up in [[Atlanta]], and became interested in tennis at the age of four after watching [[Serena Williams]] win the [[2009 Australian Open]] on television.<ref name=\"2009-goat\" /> Her parents encouraged her to try many sports, including basketball and track.<ref name=\"2009-goat\">{{cite web |last1=Maine |first1=D'Arcy |title=Meet Coco Gauff, the 15-year-old who has everyone at Wimbledon talking |url=https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/27105815/meet-coco-gauff-15-year-old-everyone-wimbledon-talking |website=ESPN |access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref> She began playing tennis at age six and decided she wanted to pursue it as a career because it was an individual sport and because of her early success in winning the \"Little Mo\" eight-and-under nationals at the age of eight.
