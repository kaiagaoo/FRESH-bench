Two themes emphasized in the founding of modern MOOCs were ''scale'' and ''availability''.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Founding of Coursera ===\nNg started the [[Stanford Engineering Everywhere]] (SEE) program, which in 2008 published a number of Stanford courses online for free. Ng taught one of these courses, \"Machine Learning\", which includes his video lectures, along with the student materials used in the Stanford CS229 class. It offered a similar experience to [[MIT OpenCourseWare|MIT's Open Courseware]] except it aimed at providing a more \"complete course\" experience, equipped with lectures, course materials, problems and solutions, etc. The SEE videos were viewed by the millions and inspired Ng to develop and iterate new versions of online tech.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nWithin Stanford, they include [[Daphne Koller]] with her \"blended learning experiences\" and co-designing a peer-grading system, John Mitchell (Courseware, a [[Learning management system|Learning Management System]]), [[Dan Boneh]] (using machine learning to sync videos, later teaching [[cryptography]] on Coursera), [[Bernd Girod]] (ClassX), and others. Outside Stanford both Ng and Thrun credit [[Sal Khan]] of [[Khan Academy]] as a huge source of inspiration. Ng was also inspired by [[LinkedIn Learning|lynda.com]] and the design of the forums of [[Stack Overflow]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nWidom, Ng, and others were ardent advocates of Khan-styled tablet recordings, and between 2009 and 2011, several hundred hours of lecture videos recorded by Stanford instructors were recorded and uploaded. Ng tested some of the original designs with a local high school to figure the best practices for recording lessons.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn October 2011, the \"applied\" version of the Stanford class (CS229a) was hosted on ml-class.org and launched, with over 100,000 students registered for its first edition. The course featured quizzes and graded programming assignments and became one of the first and most successful massive open online courses (MOOCs) created by a Stanford professor.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=55991 | work=Stanford Magazine | author = Theresa Johnson | title = Stanford for All}}</ref>\n\nTwo other courses on databases (db-class.org) and AI (ai-class.org) were launched. The ml-class and db-class ran on a platform developed by students, including Frank Chen, Jiquan Ngiam, Chuan-Yu Foo, and Yifan Mai. Word spread through social media and popular press. The three courses were 10 weeks long, and over 40,000 \"Statements of Accomplishment\" were awarded.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nNg tells the following story on the early days of Coursera:{{blockquote|In 2011, I was working with four Stanford students. We were under tremendous pressure to build new features for the 100,000+ students that were already signed up. One of the students (Frank Chen) claims another one (Jiquan Ngiam) frequently stranded him in the Stanford building and refused to give him a ride back to his dorm until very late at night, so that he no choice but to stick around and keep working. I neither confirm nor deny this story.<ref name=\":6\" />}} His work subsequently led to his founding of Coursera with Koller in 2012.
