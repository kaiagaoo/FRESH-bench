He graduated from [[McGill University]] in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in literature, then in 1998 acquired a Bachelor of Education degree from the [[University of British Columbia]]. After graduating he taught at the [[secondary school]] level in [[Vancouver]], before relocating back to Montreal in 2002 to further his studies. He was chair for the youth charity [[Katimavik]] and director of the not-for-profit [[Canadian Avalanche Association]]. In 2006, he was appointed as chair of the Liberal Party's Task Force on Youth Renewal.\n\nIn the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 federal election]], he was elected to represent the riding of [[Papineau (electoral district)|Papineau]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. He was the Liberal Party's [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition critic]] for youth and multiculturalism in 2009, and the following year he became critic for citizenship and immigration. In 2011, he was appointed as a critic for secondary education and sport. Trudeau won the [[2013 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election|leadership of the Liberal Party]] in April 2013 and led his party to victory in the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]], moving the third-placed Liberals from 36 seats to 184 seats, the largest-ever numerical increase by a party in a Canadian federal election. Trudeau is the second-youngest prime minister in Canadian history after [[Joe Clark]]; he is also the first to be the child of a previous holder of the post, as the eldest son of [[Pierre Trudeau]].\n\nMajor government initiatives he undertook during his first term as prime minister included legalizing recreational marijuana through the ''[[Cannabis Act]]''; attempting Senate appointment reform by establishing the [[Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments]] and establishing the [[Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act|federal carbon tax]]. In foreign policy, Trudeau's government negotiated trade deals such as the [[Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement]] (CUSMA) and the [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]], and signed the [[Paris Agreement]] on climate change. He was sanctioned by Canada's [[Ethics Commissioner of Canada|ethics commissioner]] for violating [[conflict of interest]] rules regarding the [[Aga Khan affair]], and later again with the [[SNC-Lavalin affair]].\n\nTrudeau led the Liberals to a [[Minority governments in Canada|minority government]] victory in the [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 federal election]]. During his second term, his government responded to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Canada|COVID-19 pandemic]], announced an [[Firearms regulation in Canada|\"assault-style\" weapons ban]] in response to the [[2020 Nova Scotia attacks]], and was investigated for a third time by the ethics commissioner for his part in the [[WE Charity scandal]], but was cleared of wrongdoing. In the [[2021 Canadian federal election|2021 federal election]], he led the Liberals to another minority government. \n\nDuring his third term, he invoked the ''[[Emergencies Act]]'' in response to the [[Freedom Convoy 2022|Freedom Convoy protests]] (the first time the act was brought into force since it was enacted in 1988) and responded to the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]] by imposing sanctions on [[Russia]] and authorizing military aid to [[Ukraine]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 14, 2022|last=Zimonjic|first=Peter|title=Canada announces additional $500M in military aid to Ukraine, adds 23 names to sanctions list|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-announces-military-aid-ukraine-1.6650616#:~:text=Canada%20is%20providing%20Ukraine%20with%20an%20additional%20%24500,the%20G20%20Summit%20in%20Bali%2C%20Indonesia%2C%20on%20Monday|access-date=June 4, 2023|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|archive-date=November 16, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221116163727/https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-announces-military-aid-ukraine-1.6650616#:~:text=Canada%20is%20providing%20Ukraine%20with%20an%20additional%20%24500,the%20G20%20Summit%20in%20Bali%2C%20Indonesia%2C%20on%20Monday|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n===Ancestry and birth===\nOn June 23, 1971, the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Prime Minister's Office]] (PMO) announced that Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s wife of four months, [[Margaret Trudeau]] (n\u00e9e Sinclair),<ref>{{Cite news |last=Griffin |first=Eugene |date=March 6, 1971 |title=Trudeau's Bride Takes All by Surprise |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |agency=Chicago Tribune Press Services |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1971/03/06/page/4/article/trudeaus-bride-takes-all-by-surprise |url-status=live |access-date=September 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305151655/http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1971/03/06/page/4/article/trudeaus-bride-takes-all-by-surprise/ |archive-date=March 5, 2017}}</ref> was pregnant and due in December.<ref>{{Cite news |last=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=June 24, 1971 |title=Rumors confirmed: Mrs. Trudeau expecting, due December |work=[[Montreal Gazette]] |agency=[[The Canadian Press]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=twwuAAAAIBAJ&pg=1854%2C4731550 |access-date=May 22, 2016 |archive-date=May 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210502044935/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=twwuAAAAIBAJ&pg=1854,4731550 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=December 1, 1971 |title=Civic doctor for Margaret |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VrYyAAAAIBAJ&pg=3710%2C10082 |access-date=October 7, 2017 |archive-date=December 18, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211218063645/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VrYyAAAAIBAJ&pg=3710,10082 |url-status=live }}</ref> Justin Trudeau was born on December 25, 1971, at 9:27&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] at the [[Ottawa Civic Hospital]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Downie |first=Jim |date=December 28, 1971 |title=Justin just like dad |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |agency=[[The Canadian Press]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19711224&id=MZA0AAAAIBAJ&pg=3055,3625264&hl=en |access-date=October 21, 2015 |archive-date=January 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125194358/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19711224&id=MZA0AAAAIBAJ&pg=3055,3625264&hl=en |url-status=live }}</ref> He is the second child in Canadian history to be born to a prime minister in office; the first was [[John A.
