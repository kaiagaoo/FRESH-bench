He also possesses a well-rounded and more flat and lower net-clearance [[backhand]] groundstroke that he is able to redirect down the line for clean winners. His greatly disguised [[drop shot]] is key to his game, as he often combines the heaviness of his groundstrokes that pushes his opponents back into the court into a defensive position, with a drop shot that is often too well-placed and disguised to deal with.
