He can either hit his forehand flat and fast for winners from every court position, or add a great amount of topspin and margin over the net. He also possesses a well-rounded and more flat and lower net-clearance [[backhand]] groundstroke that he is able to redirect down the line for clean winners. His greatly disguised [[drop shot]] is key to his game, as he often combines the heaviness of his groundstrokes that pushes his opponents back into the court into a defensive position, with a drop shot that is often too well-placed and disguised to deal with. He has an impressive net-game with great drop volleys and drive volleys, and frequently serve-and-volleys on crucial points.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nHis first serve is hit at high speeds with little emphasis on service box placement, typically at around 210 km/h (130 mph). This has led to some criticism of his serving. However, he has an excellent and reliable second serve to which he can add topspin, in order to get a high bounce off the court and either push back or get a weak return from closer-returning opponents. This serve typically reaches 150 to 170 km/h (93 to 106 mph).{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nAlcaraz has earned acclaim for his remarkable athletic and physical traits. In particular, his direct sprints, counterattacking abilities from often indefensible positions on court, and an extremely high peak [[footspeed]] which has earned him comparisons to a young [[Rafael Nadal]] and [[Ga\u00ebl Monfils]]. He has earned comparisons to [[Novak Djokovic]] for his assured lateral movement and court-coverage aided by physical splits and sliding through the court on defense, particularly on his backhand side where he is often able to neutralize his opponent's groundstroke aggression or drop shot attempts. He has also earned comparisons, on occasion, to [[Roger Federer]] for his great footwork and ability to go inside-out on his forehand and control the court with his offense.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\n==Career statistics==\n{{Main|Carlos Alcaraz career statistics}}\n\n===Grand Slam tournament performance timeline===\n{{Performance key|short=yes}}\n''Current through the [[2022 US Open \u2013 Men's singles|2022 US Open]].''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Tournament!![[2020 ATP Tour|2020]]!![[2021 ATP Tour|2021]]!![[2022 ATP Tour|2022]]!![[2023 ATP Tour|2023]]!!SR!!W\u2013L!!Win %\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:left;
