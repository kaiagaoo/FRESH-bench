She competed in [[2016 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]] as the No. 1 seed. She reached her first final here since winning in 2001 and before boycotting the event, by defeating Simona Halep in the quarterfinals and Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska in the semifinals. She did not drop a set en route to the final. Williams was upset by No. 13 seed Victoria Azarenka, whom she had defeated the last five times the pair had met, in straight sets. This marked the first time since 2004 where Williams lost two consecutive finals. She next played the [[2016 Miami Open|Miami Open]] as the defending champion. She lost in the fourth round to Svetlana Kuznetsova. This marked her first loss here since 2012 and ended her 20 match winning streak in Miami. This was also her earliest exit here since 2000, where she lost in the same round. During the clay court swing, Williams withdrew from Madrid but entered Rome. She beat [[Anna-Lena Friedsam]] and [[Christina McHale]] to progress to the quarterfinals where she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova to avenge her loss in Miami. She then went on to beat [[Irina-Camelia Begu]] and [[Madison Keys]] to win her 70th career WTA title and to win her first title of the year. This was her third Rome title in four years and fourth overall.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAt the [[2016 French Open|French Open]], Williams dropped only one set en route to the final. She defeated [[Yulia Putintseva]] in the quarterfinals despite being five points away from losing. She then beat surprise semifinalist [[Kiki Bertens]] to reach her fourth French Open final where she faced Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza in a repeat of last year's Wimbledon final where Williams was victorious. The result was not the same as that Wimbledon final as Williams lost to Muguruza in straight sets. With this loss, Williams had lost two consecutive Grand Slam finals for the first time in her career. On top of failing to equal Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam singles titles, Williams also completed the Career Grand Slam runner-up set with this loss.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAt [[2016 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], Williams only lost one set en route to the final where she faced Angelique Kerber in a rematch of their Australian Open final earlier in the year. This time, Williams defeated Kerber in straight sets to finally equal Steffi Graf's record of 22 Grand Slams in the Open Era. That was Williams's first Grand Slam title of the year, as well as her 71st career WTA title overall. In what was a brilliant serving performance, Williams only faced one break point in the whole match against Kerber which she saved with an ace. Later that day, Williams partnered with sister Venus to win their sixth Wimbledon doubles title and 14th doubles Grand Slam title overall, keeping their perfect record at Grand Slam doubles finals intact.

She beat [[Daria Gavrilova]] of Australia in straight sets in the first round, but lost to [[Petra Kvitov\u00e1]] in the second round in a three-set match that lasted over two hours.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Her next tournament was the 2018 US Open in Flushing Meadows, New York, where she was seeded 17th, although ranked 26th in the WTA ranking at the time seeds were determined. She defeated [[Magda Linette]] in the first round, [[Carina Witth\u00f6ft]] in the second round, her sister and 16th seed Venus in the third round, [[Kaia Kanepi]] in the fourth round, and 8th seed [[Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1]] in the quarterfinals. The match against Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 was a rematch of the 2016 US Open semifinal, which Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 had won. This was Williams's first win against a player in the top 10 (at the time of the match) since her return from pregnancy. Williams won her semifinal match against 19th seed [[Anastasija Sevastova]] of Latvia, winning a spot in the [[2018 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles final|women's singles final]] against [[Naomi Osaka]] of Japan which she lost in straight sets. Williams was warned for illegal coaching, penalized a point for breaking her racket, and then penalized a game for verbal abuse of the chair umpire.\n\n===2019: Return to the top 10, injuries, Wimbledon and US Open runner-up===\nWilliams started her 2019 season at the [[2019 Australian Open|Australian Open]], having not made an appearance at the tournament since winning the 2017 edition. Seeded 16th, she defeated [[Tatjana Maria]], [[Eugenie Bouchard]], and [[Dayana Yastremska]] in the first three rounds, before defeating top seed and world No. 1 [[Simona Halep]] in the fourth. In the quarterfinals, she met 7th seed [[Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1]]. Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 won the first set and lead in the second, but Williams took control of the match, winning the second and rapidly taking a huge lead in the third. However, after Williams twisted her ankle while up match point, Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 won six consecutive games, saving four match points throughout the set to win the match. This was Williams's earliest defeat at the Australian Open since her fourth-round loss in [[2014 Australian Open \u2013 Women's singles|2014]], and broke a streak of fourteen consecutive match wins in Grand Slam quarterfinals (having last lost a Grand Slam quarterfinal at the [[2013 Australian Open \u2013 Women's singles|2013 Australian Open]]). Despite this loss, her ranking climbed up to No. 11.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nWilliams went on to defeat [[Victoria Azarenka]] in the second round of the [[Indian Wells Masters]] in her 2019 campaign for a third Indian Wells crown. In the third round, viral illness caused her to retire against Spain's [[Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza]]. This was the second consecutive year she had exited at this stage. She then sustained a recurrence of a long-term knee injury which caused her to pull out of Miami and Rome after playing one match.
