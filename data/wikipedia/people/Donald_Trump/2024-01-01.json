Trump renamed it [[the Trump Organization]] and reoriented the company toward building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of business failures in the late twentieth century, he successfully launched side ventures that required little capital, mostly by licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series ''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]''. He and his businesses have been plaintiff or defendant in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six business bankruptcies.\n\t\nTrump won the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] while losing the popular vote.{{efn|name=electoral-college|Presidential elections in the U.S. are decided by the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].

His election and policies sparked numerous protests.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence without prior consensus; see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 20. --> He was the first U.S. president with no prior military or government experience. The [[Mueller special counsel investigation|2017\u20132019 special counsel investigation]] established that [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russia had interfered in the 2016 election]] to favor Trump's campaign. Trump promoted conspiracy theories and made many [[False or misleading statements by Donald Trump|false and misleading statements]] during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence without prior consensus; see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], items 49 and 53. --> Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist<!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 30. --> and many as misogynistic.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 51. -->\n\nAs president, Trump [[Executive Order 13769|ordered a travel ban]] on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and implemented a [[Trump administration family separation policy|policy of family separations]] for migrants detained at the U.S. border.<!-- This sentence must contain a summary of Trump's actions on immigration, including the Muslim travel ban, the wall, and the family separation policy; see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 52. --> He weakened environmental protections, rolling back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations. He signed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] of 2017, which cut taxes for individuals and businesses and rescinded the [[Health insurance mandate|individual health insurance mandate]] penalty of the [[Affordable Care Act]]. He appointed [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]], and [[Amy Coney Barrett]] to the U.S. Supreme Court. He reacted slowly to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]], ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, used political pressure to interfere with testing efforts, and spread misinformation about unproven treatments. Trump initiated a trade war with China and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] trade agreement, the [[Paris Agreement]] on climate change, and the [[Iran nuclear deal]]. He met with North Korean leader [[Kim Jong Un]] three times but made no progress on denuclearization.\n\nTrump refused to concede after losing the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]] to [[Joe Biden]], falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud, and [[Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election|attempted to overturn the results]] by pressuring government officials, mounting scores of unsuccessful legal challenges, and obstructing the presidential transition. On January 6, 2021, he urged his supporters to march to the [[U.S. Capitol]], which many of them then [[January 6 United States Capitol attack|attacked]], resulting in multiple deaths and interrupting the electoral vote count.\n\nTrump is the only American president to have been impeached twice. After he tried to pressure Ukraine in 2019 to investigate Biden, he was impeached by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress; he was acquitted by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in February 2020.<!-- PLEASE DISCUSS BEFORE CHANGING THIS LANGUAGE. --> The House impeached him again in January 2021, for incitement of insurrection, and the Senate acquitted him in February.

In November 2022, he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the [[2024 United States presidential election|2024 presidential election]]. In 2023, Trump was indicted [[Prosecution of Donald Trump in New York|in New York]] on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, [[Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (classified documents case)|in Florida]] on 40 felony counts related to his handling of classified documents, [[Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case)|in Washington, D.C.]], on four felony counts of conspiracy and obstruction for efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and [[Georgia election racketeering prosecution|in Georgia]] on 13 charges of racketeering and other alleged felonies committed in an effort to overturn the state's 2020 election results.
