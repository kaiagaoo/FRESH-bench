When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the [[secondary mortgage market]] collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. IndyMac's reduced liquidity was further exacerbated when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion in deposits in a \"run\" on the thrift after the public release of Schumer's letter. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac's demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf |title=Microsoft Word \u2013 Final Report \u2013 IndyMac MLR _2-26-2009_.doc |access-date=March 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419101451/http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf |archive-date=April 19, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[Office of Thrift Supervision]] (OTS) director [[John M.

Gonzales responded that the onus was on the committee to prove whether anything improper occurred. Schumer replied that Gonzales faced a higher standard, and that under this standard he had to give \"a full, complete and convincing explanation\" for why the eight attorneys were fired.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/51Iezc2kIcw Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120107121253/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51Iezc2kIcw Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51Iezc2kIcw|title=YouTube \u2013 Schumer 4|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=April 19, 2007|access-date=March 18, 2010}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Other work==\nIn January 2007, Schumer published a book, ''[[Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time]]'', outlining strategies by which Democrats could court [[Social class in the United States#Middle class|middle-class voters]].
