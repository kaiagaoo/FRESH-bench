He has the pace and clever movement to run in behind, he can dribble and create, and he can finish with both feet and his head. He usually comes deep to collect the ball to help his team build play, often looking to spread the ball wide for a teammate, before turning and sprinting towards goal. He sometimes comes too deep for the defenders to follow him; as such he has the awareness to turn on the ball and create from a forward-facing position. In the [[penalty area]] he makes small, sharp movements to spot an opportunity for a teammate to attempt to find him in space, and can change the line on which he is running and accelerate into that space, making him extremely difficult for defenders to read.<ref name=SOP1>{{cite web |url=https://www.coachesvoice.com/cv/erling-haaland-manchester-city-borussia-dortmund/ |title=Erling Haaland: Premier League Player Watch |website=The Coaches' Voice |date=25 February 2020 |accessdate=26 May 2022 |archive-date=17 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230417111907/https://www.coachesvoice.com/cv/erling-haaland-manchester-city-borussia-dortmund/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=SOP2>{{cite web |url=https://breakingthelines.com/player-analysis/player-analysis-erling-haaland/ |title=Player Analysis: Erling Haaland |date=12 April 2021 |accessdate=26 May 2022 |archive-date=4 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230204201637/https://breakingthelines.com/player-analysis/player-analysis-erling-haaland/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHaaland uses his body well when playing with his back to goal, protecting the ball effectively as he tries to bring it under control. He uses his strength to secure possession when under pressure and is also effective in providing his team's defenders with some respite following a clearance. His creativity is most apparent when he drifts into the left inside channel. His primary aim is always to get a shot off, but he also has the vision and skill to pick out a delayed run from midfield in the centre.
