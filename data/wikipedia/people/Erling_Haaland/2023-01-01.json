He uses his sizeable frame to hold play up effectively and involve others. He has the pace and clever movement to run in behind; he can dribble and create; and he can finish with both feet and his head. He usually comes deep to collect the ball to help his team build play, often looking to spread the ball wide for a teammate, before turning and sprinting towards goal. He sometimes comes too deep for the defenders to follow him, as such he has the awareness to turn on the ball and create from a forward-facing position. In the [[penalty area]], he makes small, sharp movements to spot an opportunity for a teammate to attempt to find him in space, and can change the line on which he is running and accelerate into that space, making him extremely difficult for defenders to read.<ref name=SOP1>{{cite web|url=https://www.coachesvoice.com/cv/erling-haaland-manchester-city-borussia-dortmund/ |title=Erling Haaland: Premier League Player Watch |website=The Coaches' Voice |date=25 February 2020 |accessdate=26 May 2022}}</ref><ref name=SOP2>{{cite web|url=https://breakingthelines.com/player-analysis/player-analysis-erling-haaland/ |title=Player Analysis: Erling Haaland|date=12 April 2021 |accessdate=26 May 2022}}</ref><ref name=SOP3>{{cite web|url=https://themastermindsite.com/2021/03/09/erling-haaland-player-analysis/ |title=Erling Haaland \u2013 Player Analysis|date=9 March 2021 |accessdate=26 May 2022}}</ref><ref name=SOP4>{{cite web|url=https://onenil.medium.com/erling-braut-h%C3%A5land-a-complete-analytical-breakdown-of-why-he-is-so-special-c068ae0b7539 |title=Erling Braut H\u00e5land: A complete analytical breakdown of why he is so special|date=29 October 2020 |accessdate=26 May 2022}}</ref>\n\nHe uses his body well when playing with his back to goal, protecting the ball effectively as he tries to bring it under control. Given he can use his strength to secure possession when under pressure, he is also effective in providing his team's defenders with some respite following a clearance. Haaland's creativity is most apparent when he drifts into the left inside channel. His primary aim is always to get a shot off, but he also has the vision and skill to pick out a delayed run from midfield in the centre. His ability to carry the ball at pace also helps create for others, especially on the counter-attack.<ref name=SOP1/><ref name=SOP2/><ref name=SOP3/><ref name=SOP4/>\n\nHaaland idolises [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]] and Cristiano Ronaldo, but also cites [[Michu]], [[Jamie Vardy]], [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] and [[Robin van Persie]] as inspirations, and credits [[Virgil van Dijk]] and [[Sergio Ramos]] as two of the toughest defenders he has played against.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/uefa-champions-league/story/3955668/meet-erling-haalandthe-teenage-striker-who-idolizes-zlataneats-like-ronaldo-and-scores-goals-like-them-both?platform=amp|title=Meet Erling Haaland, the teenage striker who idolizes Zlatan, eats like Ronaldo and scores goals like them both|publisher=ESPN|date=1 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51633521 |title=Erling Braut Haaland has an unusual footballing hero in ex-Swansea star Michu |website=BBC Sport |date=25 February 2020 |accessdate=19 April 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Erling Haaland: Borussia Dortmund striker on Jamie Vardy inspiration, Flow Kingz reunion and more |date=27 January 2022 |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11899/12526621/erling-haaland-borussia-dortmund-striker-on-jamie-vardy-inspiration-flow-kingz-reunion-and-more |website=Sky Sports |archive-url=https://archive.today/20220127182744/https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11899/12526621/erling-haaland-borussia-dortmund-striker-on-jamie-vardy-inspiration-flow-kingz-reunion-and-more |archive-date=27 January 2022}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nHaaland is the son of the Norwegian former footballer Alfie Haaland, and former women's [[heptathlon]] athlete Gry Marita Braut.<ref>{{cite web |title=Molde starlet Erling Braut Haland wants to follow father Alf-Inge and play for Leeds United. |publisher=Talksport |date=10 February 2017 |access-date=3 January 2018 |url=https://talksport.com/football/molde-starlet-erling-braut-haland-wants-follow-father-alf-inge-and-play-leeds-united |archive-date=4 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104015405/https://talksport.com/football/molde-starlet-erling-braut-haland-wants-follow-father-alf-inge-and-play-leeds-united |url-status=live }}</ref> In a 2017 interview with Norwegian newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'', Haaland said that \"The dream is to win the Premier League with Leeds.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.aftenposten.no/article/ap-GGP7A6.html |title=Vraket utlandet for \u00e5 spille under Solskj\u00e6r |newspaper=Aftenposten |language=no |access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref> His cousins [[Jonatan Braut Brunes]] and [[Albert Tj\u00e5land]] are also professional footballers.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fotballforbund|first=Norges|title=Jonatan Braut Brunes \u2013 Profil |url=https://www.fotball.no/fotballdata/person/profil/?fiksId=3707103|access-date=20 August 2021 |website=fotball.no \u2013 Norges Fotballforbund|language=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Haaland's cousin is making waves in Norway... with 64 goals in 37 matches!
