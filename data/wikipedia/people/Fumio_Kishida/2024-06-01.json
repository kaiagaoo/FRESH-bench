\u6587\u96c4|Kishida Fumio|extra=born 29 July 1957\n}} is a Japanese politician who has served as [[Prime Minister of Japan]] and [[President of the Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|President]] of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) since 2021. A member of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]], he previously served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] from 2012 to 2017 and as acting [[Minister of Defense (Japan)|Minister of Defense]] in 2017. From 2017 to 2020, he also chaired the LDP Policy Research Council.\n\nBorn into a political family, Kishida spent part of his childhood in the United States, where he attended elementary school in New York City. After beginning his career in finance, Kishida entered politics and was elected to the House of Representatives in [[1993 Japanese general election|1993]] as a member of the LDP. Kishida was appointed to various posts in the cabinets of prime ministers [[Shinzo Abe]] and [[Yasuo Fukuda]] from 2007 to 2008, and was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2012 after Abe regained the premiership following the [[2012 Japanese general election|2012 general election]], serving for five years and becoming the longest-serving Foreign Affairs Minister in Japanese history. Kishida resigned from the Abe cabinet in 2017 in order to head the LDP's Policy Research Council. Kishida also assumed leadership of the LDP's more moderate [[K\u014dchikai]] faction in 2012 following the retirement of faction leader [[Makoto Koga]], a position he held until his resignation in 2023. Long considered a potential future prime minister, Kishida ran in the [[2020 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election|2020 LDP leadership election]], but lost to [[Yoshihide Suga]]. He ran again for the party leadership in [[2021 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election|2021]], this time winning in a second round run-off against opponent [[Taro Kono]]. Kishida was confirmed as prime minister by the [[National Diet]] four days later on 4 October 2021.\n\nAs prime minister, Kishida has stated that his premiership will focus on a \"new model of [[capitalism]]\" by seeking to implement [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistributive policies]] to expand the [[middle class]]. He led the LDP to victory in the [[2021 Japanese general election|2021 general election]] and the [[2022 Japanese House of Councillors election|2022 House of Councillors election]], albeit at a slightly reduced majority. He oversaw the dissolution of the [[Unification Church]] (UC) in Japan following the [[assassination of Shinzo Abe|assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe]] in 2022, the disbandment of his faction K\u014dchikai, along with [[Seiwa Seisaku Kenky\u016bkai|Seiwakai]] and [[Shisuikai]] following a [[2023\u20132024 Japanese slush fund scandal|party-wide corruption scandal]] and the [[Discharge of radioactive water of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant|release of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant]] into the Pacific Ocean in 2023. He [[Cabinet reshuffle|reshuffled]] his cabinet twice, in [[Second Kishida Cabinet (First Reshuffle)|August 2022]] to remove cabinet members affiliated with the UC and in [[Second Kishida Cabinet (Second Reshuffle)|September 2023]] following low approval ratings. On foreign policy, he has continued strengthening the [[Quadrilateral Security Dialogue|Quad Security Dialogue]] and close cooperation with [[NATO]] in pursuit of the [[Free and Open Indo-Pacific]] strategy, signed the [[American\u2013Japanese\u2013Korean trilateral pact]] in 2023, formed [[Defense pact|security pacts]] with the United Kingdom and Australia, taken steps to repair ties with South Korea and in 2022 instructed the cabinet to increase Japan's military budget by 65% by 2027. Kishida responded to the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]] by becoming the first Asian country to impose [[International sanctions during the Russian invasion of Ukraine|sanctions on Russia and Belarus]] and authorizing civilian aid to Ukraine. He survived an [[Attempted assassination of Fumio Kishida|assassination attempt]] on 15 April 2023 while delivering a campaign speech.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKishida was born to a political family in [[Shibuya]], Tokyo, on 29 July 1957.<ref name=\"thediplomat1\">{{cite web |last1=Akimoto |first1=Daisuke |date=7 September 2021 |title=The Arrival of Kishida Diplomacy? |url=https://thediplomat.com/2021/09/the-arrival-of-kishida-diplomacy/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210928162945/https://thediplomat.com/2021/09/the-arrival-of-kishida-diplomacy/ |archive-date=28 September 2021 |access-date=29 September 2021 |website=The Diplomat |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=kantei>{{cite web|title=Fumio Kishida|url=https://japan.kantei.go.jp/96_abe/meibo/daijin/kishida_e.html|publisher=Kantei|access-date=30 September 2021|archive-date=28 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210928163701/https://japan.kantei.go.jp/96_abe/meibo/daijin/kishida_e.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=jtimes>{{cite news|title=Abe Cabinet (Formed December 26, 2012)|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/cabinet-profiles/abe-cabinet-formed-december-26-2012|access-date=30 September 2021|newspaper=The Japan Times|archive-date=30 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210930134100/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/cabinet-profiles/abe-cabinet-formed-december-26-2012|url-status=live}}</ref> His father, Fumitake Kishida, was a government official in the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] and director of The Small and Medium Enterprise Agency.
