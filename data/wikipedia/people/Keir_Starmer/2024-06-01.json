He has been [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Holborn and St Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St Pancras]] since 2015. He was previously [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] from 2008 to 2013.\n\nStarmer was born in London and raised in [[Surrey]], where he attended the selective state [[Reigate Grammar School]], which became a [[Private schools in the United Kingdom|private school]] while he was a student. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from the [[University of Leeds]] in 1985 and gained a postgraduate [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] degree at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1986. After being [[called to the bar]], Starmer practised predominantly in criminal defence work, specialising in human rights matters. Becoming a member of [[Doughty Street Chambers]] in 1990, he was appointed as [[Queen's Counsel]] (QC) in 2002. In 2008, he became Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and Head of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], holding these positions until 2013. On conclusion of his five-year term as DPP, he was appointed [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in the [[2014 New Year Honours]].\n\nElected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], Starmer was appointed [[Shadow Minister for Immigration]]<!--Not \"of State\" per [[WP:RS]]--> by new party leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in September 2015. He resigned in 2016 as part of the wider [[June 2016 British shadow cabinet resignations]] in protest at Corbyn's leadership, but accepted a new post under Corbyn later that year as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]] following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|EU membership referendum]]. Starmer advocated a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|second referendum on Brexit]], in which he stated he would vote to \"remain\"; this policy was ultimately included in the 2019 Labour election platform.\n\nAfter Corbyn resigned following Labour's [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] defeat, Starmer won the party's [[2020 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|2020 leadership election]]. His leadership has been characterised by movement towards the [[political centre]] and abandonment of much of the [[left-wing]] platform of his leadership campaign, as well as by opposition to some of the [[British government response to the COVID-19 pandemic|government response]] to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and issues such as [[Partygate]], the [[September 2022 United Kingdom mini-budget|September 2022 mini-budget]], and the [[2021-present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis|cost of living crisis]]. Starmer has emphasised the importance of eliminating [[Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party|antisemitism in the Labour Party]]. In 2023, he set out five missions for a Labour government, targeting issues such as economic growth, health, clean energy, crime, and education. Since late 2021, the party has maintained leads in [[Opinion polling for the 2024 United Kingdom general election|opinion polling]] over the governing [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], often by very wide margins.\n\n==Early life and education==\nKeir Rodney Starmer was born in [[Southwark]], London, on 2 September 1962.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=Starmer, Rt Hon.
