He has been [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Holborn and St Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St Pancras]] since 2015. He was previously [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] from 2008 to 2013. Ideologically, Starmer has been described as being on the [[soft left]] within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\nStarmer was born in London and raised in [[Surrey]], where he attended the selective state [[Reigate Grammar School]], which became an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]] while he was a student. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from the [[University of Leeds]] in 1985 and gained a postgraduate [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] degree at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1986. After being called to the [[Bar (law)|Bar]], Starmer practised predominantly in criminal defence work, with a particular interest in human rights issues. He was a member of [[Doughty Street Chambers]]. He was appointed as [[Queen's Counsel]] (QC) in 2002. In 2008, he became Director of Public Prosecutions and Head of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], holding these roles until 2013. On conclusion of his five-year term as DPP, he was appointed [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in the [[2014 New Year Honours]].\n\nElected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], Starmer became [[Shadow Minister for Immigration]]<!--Not \"of State\" per [[WP:RS]]--> in September 2015, before being appointed in October 2016 as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]] following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|EU membership referendum]]. Starmer advocated a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|second referendum on Brexit]], saying he would have voted for \"[[Remain (Brexit)|Remain]]\". After [[Jeremy Corbyn]] resigned following Labour's defeat at the [[2019 UK general election|2019 general election]], Starmer won the [[2020 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|2020 Labour Party leadership election]] in April.\n\nStarmer's tenure as leader has been marked by his opposition to some of the [[British government response to the COVID-19 pandemic|government\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic]] and various other issues involving the government, including [[Partygate]]. Since his election as leader, his party has had mixed results in by-elections and local elections.
