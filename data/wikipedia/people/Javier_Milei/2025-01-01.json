He has taught university courses and written on various aspects of economics and politics and also hosted radio programs on the subject. [[Political positions of Javier Milei|Milei's views]] distinguish him within mainstream [[Politics of Argentina|Argentine politics]].\n\nIn November 2021, Milei was elected to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]], representing the [[Buenos Aires|City of Buenos Aires]] for [[La Libertad Avanza]]. As a national deputy, he limited his legislative activities to voting, focusing instead on critiquing what he sees as Argentina's political elite and its propensity for high government spending. Milei pledged not to raise taxes and donated his national deputy salary through a monthly raffle. He defeated the incumbent economy minister, [[Sergio Massa]], in the second round of the [[2023 Argentine general election|2023 general election]], for the post of president, on a platform that held the ideological dominance of [[Peronism]] responsible for the ongoing [[2018\u2013present Argentine monetary crisis|Argentine monetary crisis]].\n\nMilei is known for his flamboyant personality, distinctive personal style, and strong media presence, including his catchphrase \"''[[\u00a1Viva la libertad, carajo!]]''\".{{Efn|Translated into English as \"Long live freedom, damn it!\".|name=VVLC}} He has been described politically as a [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] and [[Right-libertarianism|right-wing libertarian]] who supports ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics, aligning specifically with [[Night-watchman state|minarchist]] and [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] principles. Milei has proposed a comprehensive overhaul of the country's fiscal and structural policies. On social issues, he opposes [[Abortion in Argentina|abortion]] and [[Legality of euthanasia#Argentina|euthanasia]] and supports civilian ownership of [[Overview of gun laws by nation#Argentina|firearms]]. He also supports [[freedom of choice]] on drug policy, [[Prostitution in Argentina|sex work]], and [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|same-sex marriage]]. In foreign policy, he advocates closer relations with the [[Argentina\u2013United States relations|United States]], the [[Argentina\u2013United Kingdom relations|United Kingdom]], and [[Argentina\u2013Israel relations|Israel]], and supporting [[Argentina\u2013Ukraine relations|Ukraine]] in response to the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of the country]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nJavier Gerardo Milei was born on 22 October 1970 in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires]], to Norberto Milei and Alicia Lucich.<ref name=\"Il Post 2023\">{{cite web |date=14 August 2023
