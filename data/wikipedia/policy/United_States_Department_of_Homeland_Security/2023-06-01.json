The bill was also controversial for the presence of unrelated \"[[Rider (legislation)|riders]]\", as well as for eliminating certain union-friendly [[civil service]] and labor protections for department employees. Without these protections, employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security, incompetence or insubordination, and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives.

The system has two types of advisories: alerts and bulletins. NTAS bulletins permit the secretary to communicate critical terrorism information that, while not necessarily indicative of a specific threat against the United States, can reach homeland security partners or the public quickly, thereby allowing recipients to implement necessary protective measures. Alerts are issued when there is specific and credible information of a terrorist threat against the United States. Alerts have two levels: elevated and imminent. An elevated alert is issued when there is credible information about an attack but only general information about timing or a target. An Imminent Alert is issued when the threat is very specific and impending in the very near term.{{cn|date=October 2022}}\n\n[[File:Hsas-chart with header.svg|upright=0.8|thumb|The [[Homeland Security Advisory System]] scale]]\nOn March 12, 2002, the [[Homeland Security Advisory System]], a color-coded terrorism risk advisory scale, was created as the result of a [[Presidential Directive]] to provide a \"comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to Federal, State, and local authorities and to the American people\". Many procedures at government facilities are tied into the alert level; for example a facility may search all entering vehicles when the alert is above a certain level. Since January 2003, it has been administered in coordination with DHS; it has also been the target of frequent jokes and ridicule on the part of the administration's detractors about its ineffectiveness. After resigning, Tom Ridge said he did not always agree with the threat level adjustments pushed by other government agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/speeches/speech_0053.shtm |title=Remarks by Governor Ridge Announcing Homeland Security Advisory System|access-date=May 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2003, the office{{Clarify|What office?|date=January 2010}} was merged into the Department of Homeland Security and the White House Homeland Security Council, both of which were created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Council, similar in nature to the National Security Council, retains a policy coordination and advisory role and is led by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security.<ref name=\"hsact2002\" />\n\n==Seal==\n{{Main|Seal of the United States Department of Homeland Security}}\nThe seal was developed with input from senior DHS leadership, employees, and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts. The [[Ad Council]] \u2013 which partners with DHS on its Ready.gov campaign \u2013 and the consulting company Landor Associates were responsible for graphic design and maintaining heraldic integrity.\n\n{{blockquote|The seal is symbolic of the Department's mission \u2013 to prevent attacks and protect Americans \u2013 on the land, in the sea and in the air. In the center of the seal, a graphically styled white American eagle appears in a circular blue field. The eagle's outstretched wings break through an inner red ring into an outer white ring that contains the words \"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF\" in the top half and \"HOMELAND SECURITY\" in the bottom half in a circular placement. The eagle's wings break through the inner circle into the outer ring to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will break through traditional bureaucracy and perform government functions differently. In the tradition of the Great Seal of the United States, the eagle's talon on the left holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 seeds while the eagle's talon on the right grasps 13 arrows.\n\nCentered on the eagle's breast is a shield divided into three sections containing elements that represent the American homeland \u2013 air, land, and sea. The top element, a dark blue sky, contains 22 stars representing the original 22 entities that have come together to form the department. The left shield element contains white mountains behind a green plain underneath a light blue sky. The right shield element contains four wave shapes representing the oceans alternating light and dark blue separated by white lines.}}\n- DHS June 6, 2003<ref>[https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/press_release_0189.shtm \"Fact Sheet: Department of Homeland Security Seal\", DHS press release, June 19, 2003.

Examples from the survey reveal most concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit, dealing with poor performance, rewarding creativity and innovation, leadership generating high levels of motivation in the workforce, recognition for doing a good job, lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=nation_world&id=5017688|title=Homeland Security employees rank last in job satisfaction survey|publisher=ABC Inc., WLS-TV Chicago|date=February 8, 2007|access-date=October 31, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318091056/http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=nation_world&id=5017688|archive-date=March 18, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Bill|last=Conroy|url=http://narcosphere.narconews.com/story/2007/1/31/17296/1136|title=DHS memo reveals agency personnel are treated like \"human capital\"|publisher=Narco News|date=January 31, 2007|access-date=October 31, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017163524/http://narcosphere.narconews.com/story/2007/1/31/17296/1136|archive-date=October 17, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDHS is the only large federal agency to score below 50% in overall survey rankings.
