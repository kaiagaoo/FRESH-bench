To provide some background behind this claim, recall the macroeconomic identity that the trade balance has to be equal to the capital balance which in turn is equal to savings minus investment. So, in a country like Germany running a trade surplus, capital outflows exceed capital inflows and savings exceed investment, whereas the United States is running a trade deficit and capital inflows exceed capital outflows, and investment has to exceed savings. Most economists argue that savings and investment are not significantly affected by policies impacting imports and exports such as tariff rates. In the standard intertemporal model of international finance (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1995) the capital balance is determined by the difference between the world and autarky interest rates which in turn are driven by differences in productivity growth. Countries with above average income growth in earlier periods should run current account deficits, as in these countries consumption is expected to be larger than production in earlier periods.\"}}</ref> Most economists are skeptical of the ability of tariffs to achieve the first three of these goals.<ref name=\"Bekkers-Schroeter-2020\"/>  A study estimates that U.S. exports to China provide support to 1.2 million American jobs and that Chinese multinational companies directly employ 197,000 Americans, while U.S. companies invested $105 billion in China in 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|date=Jan 14, 2021|title=U.S.-China trade war has cost up to 245,000 U.S. jobs: business group study|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-jobs-idUSKBN29J2O9}}</ref> Economists have studied the impact of trade with China and increasing labor productivity on employment in the American manufacturing sector, with mixed results.<ref name=\"Bekkers-Schroeter-2020\"/><ref name=\"Autor-2013\">{{cite journal |title=The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States |first1=David H. |last1=Autor |first2=David |last2=Dorn |first3=Gordon H. |last3=Hanson |year=2013 |journal=American Economic Review |volume=103 |number=6 |pages=2121\u20132168 |doi=10.1257/aer.103.6.2121|s2cid=2498232 |doi-access=free |hdl=1721.1/95952 |hdl-access=free }}</ref><ref name=\"Feenstra-2019\">{{cite journal |first1=R.C. |last1=Feenstra |first2=H. |last2=Ma |first3=Y. |last3=Xu |title=US exports and employment |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=120 |year=2019 |pages=46\u201358 |doi=10.1016/j.jinteco.2019.05.002|s2cid=53835329 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w24056.pdf }}</ref><ref name=\"Kehoe-2018\">{{cite journal |title=Global Imbalances and Structural Change in the United States |first1=Timothy J. |last1=Kehoe |first2=Kim J. |last2=Ruhl |first3=Joseph B. |last3=Steinberg |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=126 |number=2 |year=2018 |pages=761\u2013796 |doi=10.1086/696279|s2cid=154878550 |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1597&context=usdeptcommercepub }}</ref> Most economists believe that the American trade deficit is the result of macroeconomic factors, rather than trade policy.<ref name=\"Bekkers-Schroeter-2020\"/><ref name=\"Guo-2018\"/><ref name=\"Chong-Li-2019\"/><ref name=\"Nicita-2019\"/> While increased tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to decrease US imports from China, they are expected to lead to increased imports from other countries, leaving the United States' overall trade deficit largely unchanged - a phenomenon known as [[trade diversion]].<ref name=\"Bekkers-Schroeter-2020\"/><ref name=\"Guo-2018\"/><ref name=\"Chong-Li-2019\"/><ref name=\"Obstfeld-FT\">{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/1cbc63c4-432c-11e8-97ce-ea0c2bf34a0b |title=Targeting specific trade deficits is a game of whack-a-mole |first=Maurice |last=Obstfeld |date=22 April 2018 |access-date=24 October 2020 |publisher=[[Financial Times]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Nicita-2019\">{{cite journal |url=https://unctad.org/webflyer/trade-and-trade-diversion-effects-united-states-tariffs-china |first=Alessandro |last=Nicita |title=Trade and Trade Diversion Effects of United States Tariffs on China |year=2019 |journal=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|series=Voice of researchers }}</ref>\n\n=== Trump administration's complaints ===\n{{See also|Trump tariffs}}\nDonald Trump's first noted advocacy for tariffs was prompted by Japanese economic success in the 1980s, arguing that the [[U.S. trade deficit]] was a burden and that tariffs would promote domestic manufacturing that would keep the United States from being \"ripped off\" by its trading partners.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/06/08/618242932/as-u-s-flexes-its-muscles-on-trade-other-countries-are-beginning-to-push-back |title=As U.S. Flexes Its Muscles On Trade, Other Countries Are Beginning To Push Back |last=Zarroli |first=Jim |date=June 8, 2018 |website=NPR |access-date=August 26, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/politics/china-trade-donald-trump.html|title=Trump's Love for Tariffs Began in Japan's '80s Boom|first1=Jim|last1=Tankersley|first2=Mark|last2=Landler|date=May 15, 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Imposing tariffs was subsequently a major plank of his successful 2016 presidential campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/07/28/news/economy/donald-trump-polls-taxes-wages/index.html|title=Donald Trump wants to be the 'jobs president.'

US-China relations have hit rock bottom, especially since Donald Trump took office. The US-China trade war is now taking a toll on the world system. For example, it is creating fissures among ASEAN members...I am not advocating for joining a US-lead platform as a devoted member. To push back against Chinese adventurism by deepening dependence on another power also runs counter to the very logic of protecting our national sovereignty. India today is strong enough to stand for her interest and yet must be adroit enough to find common ground with those with whom her interests align, whether to its West or East. China must be made to choose: Is it willing to push the equally proud, equally numerous, equally historical and glorious civilisation to the south in this long-term direction for a few square kilometres of territory and a round of chest-thumping?}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bhattacharjee |first1=Govind |title=The China Trade |url=https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/the-china-trade-1502906391.html |agency=The Statesman |publisher=The Statesman |date=July 6, 2020 |quote=This has given India one lifetime opportunity to attract investments and companies away from China unto itself. Hence the Prime Minister's emphasis on 'Buy Local, Be Global' and Atmanirbhar Bharat, and to ultimately substitute China as the world's supplier. Unfortunately, it is not only cheap labour and improvement in the ease of doing business that will enable India to claim a substantial share of China's global business. We also need to understand that we are not the only player vying for the pie...Of the 56 companies that relocated their production bases from China in the aftermath of the US-China trade war of 2018- 19, only three came to India and the rest went to Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand.
