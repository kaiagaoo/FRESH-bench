The initial conflict had developed from the tribes' having been in a trust with Texas from 1968 to 1987 before being granted a federal trust, resulting in a statute governing the tribes' subjugation to Texas's gambling restrictions.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mann |first=Ronald |date=June 16, 2022 |title=Divided court rejects Texas' bid to control gambling in tribal casinos |url=https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/06/divided-court-rejects-texas-bid-to-control-gambling-in-tribal-casinos/ |access-date=June 22, 2022 |work=Scotusblog}}</ref> The ruling emphasized that the tribes have the power to regulate electronic bingo games on their land regardless of the state's prohibition of non-prohibited gambling.
