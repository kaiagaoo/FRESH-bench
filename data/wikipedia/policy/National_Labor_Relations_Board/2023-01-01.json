Under the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] it supervises [[election]]s for [[trade union|labor union]] representation and can investigate and remedy [[unfair labor practice]]s. Unfair labor practices may involve union-related situations or instances of [[protected concerted activity]]. The NLRB is governed by a five-person board and a [[General Counsel]], all of whom are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] with the [[Advice and consent|consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Board members are appointed to five-year terms and the General Counsel is appointed to a four-year term. The General Counsel acts as a prosecutor and the Board acts as an [[appellate]] [[quasi-judicial body]] from decisions of [[administrative law judge]]s.\n\nThe NLRB is headquartered at 1015 Half St. SE, Washington, D.C., with over 30 regional, sub-regional and residential offices throughout the United States.\n\n{{Toclimit}}\n\n==History==\n{{Update section|date=October 2020}}\n\n===1933\u20131935: First collective bargaining organization 'National Labor Board'===\nThe history of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) can be traced to enactment of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] in 1933. Section 7(a) of the act protected collective bargaining rights for unions,{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=8}} but was difficult to enforce. The NLRB was not given monitoring powers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2018-08-01|title=Regulatory Monitors: Policing Firms in the Compliance Era|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/265|journal=Faculty Scholarship|access-date=2020-10-10|archive-date=2020-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200604022358/https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/265/|url-status=live}}</ref>'''{{rp|23}}''' A massive wave of union organizing was punctuated by employer and [[union violence]], [[general strike]]s, and [[recognition strike]]s.{{sfn|Dubofsky|Dulles|2004|pp=252\u201354}}{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=217\u201318}}{{sfn|Rayback|pp=328\u201329}} The National Industrial Recovery Act was administered by the [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA). At the outset, NRA Administrator [[Hugh S. Johnson]] believed that Section 7(a) would be self-enforcing, but the tremendous labor unrest proved him wrong. On August 5, 1933, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] announced the establishment of the [[National Labor Board]], under the auspices of the NRA, to implement the collective bargaining provisions of Section 7(a).{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=25}}\n\nThe National Labor Board (NLB) established a system of 20 regional boards to handle the immense caseload. Each regional board had a representative designated by local labor unions, local employers, and a \"public\" representative. All were unpaid. The public representative acted as the chair. The regional boards could hold hearings and propose settlements to disputes. Initially, they lacked authority to order representation elections, but this changed after Roosevelt issued additional executive orders on February 1 and February 23, 1934.\n\nThe NLB, too, proved ineffective. Congress passed Public Resolution No. 44 on June 19, 1934, which empowered the president to appoint a new labor board with authority to issue subpoenas, hold elections, and mediate labor disputes.{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=47}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|2003|p=151}} On June 29, President Roosevelt abolished the NLB and in [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 6763 established a new, three-member National Labor Relations Board.{{sfn|Vittoz|1987|p= 144}}{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=71\u201372}}\n\n[[Lloyd K. Garrison]] was the first Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board (often referred to by scholars the \"First NLRB\" or \"Old NLRB\").{{sfn|Vittoz|1987|p=145}} The \"First NLRB\" established organizational structures which continue at the NLRB in the 21st century. This includes the regional structure of the board; the use of [[administrative law judge]]s and regional hearing officers to initially rule on cases; an appeal process to the national board; and the use of expert staff, organized into various divisions, at the national level.{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=156}} Formally, Garrison established the:{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=79\u201380}}\n* Executive Office, which handled administrative activities of the national and regional boards, field staff, and Legal Division. It was overseen by an Executive Secretary.\n* Examining Division, national staff which conducted field investigations and assisted the regional boards with adjudications, hearings, and representative elections.\n* Information Division, which provided the press and public with news.\n* Legal Division, which assisted the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in seeking compliance with board decisions in the courts, or in responding to suits brought about by board decisions.<ref>The \"first NLRB\" was barred from initiating or responding to lawsuits itself. It could only ask the Department of Justice to act on its behalf.</ref>\n* Research Division, which studied decisions of the regional boards so that a comprehensive labor law might be developed, and studied the economics of each case.\n\nWithin a year, however, most of the jurisdiction of the \"First NLRB\" was stripped away. Its decisions in the automobile, newspaper, textile, and steel industries proved so volatile that Roosevelt himself often removed these cases from the board's jurisdiction. Several federal court decisions further limited the board's power. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert F. Wagner]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]] \u2013 [[New York (state)|NY]]) subsequently pushed legislation through Congress to give a statutory basis to federal labor policy that survived court scrutiny. On July 5, 1935, a new law\u2014the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA, also known as the Wagner Act)\u2014superseded the NIRA and established a new, long-lasting federal labor policy.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2003|pp=400\u201306}} The NLRA designated the National Labor Relations Board as the implementing agency.\n\n===1935\u20131939: Constitutionality, communism, and organizational changes===\n[[File:Madden witt fahy.jpg|thumb|[[J. Warren Madden]] (left), [[Nathan Witt]], and [[Charles Fahy]] (right) reviewing documents before a congressional hearing on December 13, 1937]]\nThe first Chairman of the \"new\" NLRB was [[J. Warren Madden]], professor of the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]].<ref>\"President Names New Labor Board.\" ''New York Times''. August 24, 1935.</ref> Madden largely confirmed the previous structure of the \"first NLRB\" by formally establishing five divisions within the agency:\n* '''Administrative Division:''' Oversaw all administrative activities of national and regional boards and their finances; led by Secretary\n* '''Economic Division:''' Analyzed economic evidence in cases; made studies of economics of labor relations for use by board and courts; supervised by Chief Industrial Economist; also known as the Technical Service Division{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=219}}\n* '''Legal Division:''' Handled NLRB either decisions appealed to courts or cases in which NLRB sought enforcement of its decisions; overseen by General Counsel (hired by NLRB board); comprised two subdivisions:\n** Litigation Section: Advised national and regional boards, prepared briefs, worked with Justice Department\n** Review Section: Analyzed regional hearings and decisions; issued interpretations of law; prepared forms; drafted regulations\n* '''Publications Division:''' Handled all press and public inquiries; published decisions of national and regional boards and their rules and regulations; overseen by Director of Publications\n* '''Trial Examining Division:''' Held hearings before the national board; overseen by Chief Trial Examiner\nBenedict Wolf served as first Secretary of the NLRB, [[Charles H. Fahy]] the first General Counsel, and [[David J. Saposs]] the first Chief Industrial Economist.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=79, 170, 174\u201375}} Wolf resigned in mid-1937, and [[Nathan Witt]], an attorney in the Legal Division, was named Secretary in October.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=111, 143}}\n\nThe Economic Division was a critical one for the NLRB. Cause-and-effect was one of the fundamental assumptions of the National Labor Relations Act, and for the causes of labor unrest to be understood economic analysis was needed.{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=344}} From the start, the Economic Division undertook three important tasks: 1) Gather economic data in support of cases before the courts; 2) Conduct general studies of labor relations to guide the board in formulating decisions and policies; and 3) Research the history of labor relations (the history of written agreements, whether certain issues were historically part of collective bargaining, how unions functioned internally, trends in employer activities, trends in collective bargaining, whether certain employer actions led to labor disputes, etc.) so that the board could educate itself, the courts, Congress, and the public about labor relations.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=176\u201379}} The first function proved critical to the survival of the NLRB. It was the Economic Division's data and analysis, more than then NLRB's legal reasoning, which proved critical in persuading the Supreme Court to sustain the Wagner Act in ''NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel''.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=176\u201379, 191}}{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=347}} The Court even cited several Economic Division studies in its decision.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=228\u201329}} In the wake of ''Jones & Laughlin Steel'', many labor relations experts outside the agency concluded that economic analysis was \"an accepted fact\" essential to the proper functioning of the agency.{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=233}} The Economic Division did, too.  It asked Madden to pair an economist with an attorney in every important case,{{sfn|Eisner|2000|p=101}} and prepared outline of the economic data needed to support each case in case it went before the courts.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=182\u201383}}\n\nDuring his time on the NLRB, Madden was often opposed by the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), which believed that Madden was using the NLRA and the procedures and staff of the NLRB to favor the AFL's primary competitor, the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO).<ref>Stark, Louis. \"Both A.F.L. and C.I.O. Hit at National Labor Board.\" ''New York Times''. October 14, 1937.</ref>{{sfn|Gall|1999|pp=83\u201384, 97\u201398}} The NLRB and NLRA were also under intense pressure from employers, the press, congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and conservative [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=171\u201373}}{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=2}}\n\nThe NLRB's Economic Division proved critical in pushing for a congressional investigation into employer anti-union activities, and ensuring that investigation was a success. The Economic Division was deeply aware of employer use of [[Labor spy|labor spies]], violence, and [[company union]]s to thwart union organizing, and quietly pressed for a congressional investigation into these and other tactics. Senator [[Robert M. La Follette Jr.]] took up the suggestion, on June 6, 1936, the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Committee on Education and Labor]] established a Subcommittee Investigating Violations of Free Speech and the Rights of Labor chaired by La Follette.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=214\u201323}} Better known as the \"[[La Follette Committee]]\", the subcommittee held extensive hearings for five years and published numerous reports.  The committee uncovered extensive evidence of millions of company dollars used to pay for spies and [[fifth column]]ists within unions, exposed the culpability of local law enforcement in acts of violence and murder against union supporters (particularly in the [[Harlan County War]]),{{sfn|Baker|Stack|2006|pp=56\u201357}} revealed the wide extent of illegal [[blacklisting]] of union members, and exposed the use of armed [[strikebreaker]]s and widespread stockpiling of tear gas, vomit gas, machine guns, mortars, and armor by corporations to use against [[Strike action|strikers]].{{sfn|Luff|2007|p=774}} Some of the evidence the committee used was provided by the Economic Division,{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=90}} and the investigation proved critical for a time in defending the agency from business and congressional attack.{{sfn|Gross|1974|pp=214\u201323}}\n\nThe biggest issue the NLRB faced was constitutional. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and NLRB legal staff wanted the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to rule as quickly as possible on the constitutionality of the NLRA. But the Board and Justice Department also realized that the Court's [[Lochner era|''Lochner'' era]] legal philosophy made it unlikely for the Court to uphold the Act. Subsequently, Madden strove to resolve minor cases before they could become court challenges, and worked to delay appeals as long as possible until the best possible case could be brought to the Court.{{sfn|Chasse|2011|p=57}} This legal strategy paid off. The Supreme Court upheld the NLRA in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation]]'', 301 U.S. 1 (1937).{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=643\u201346}} Afterward, Madden continued to strategically guide the NLRB's legal efforts to strengthen the federal courts' view of the NLRA and the board's actions.{{sfn|Chasse|2011|p=57}} Because of the efforts of Madden and NLRB General Counsel Charles H. Fahy, the Supreme Court reviewed only 27 cases between August 1935 and March 1941, even though the board had processed nearly 5,000 cases since its inception. The Supreme Court enforced the NLRB's rulings in 19 cases without modifying them, enforced them with modification in six more, and denied enforcement in two cases. Additionally, the Board won all 30 [[injunction]] and all 16 representation cases before the lower courts, a rate of success unequalled by any other federal agency.{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=662\u201363}}\n\nAFL opposition to the \"Madden Board\" grew after decisions in ''Shipowners' Ass'n of the Pacific Coast'', 7 NLRB 1002 (1938), ''enf'd'' ''[[American Federation of Labor v. National Labor Relations Board]]'', 308 U.S. 401 (1940) (awarding a longshoremen's unit to the CIO rather than the AFL), and ''American Can Co''., 13 NLRB 1252 (1939) (unit's history of collective bargaining outweighs desire of workers to form craft-only unit).<ref>{{harvnb|Bernstein|Piven|1969|pp=654\u201355}} The AFL held to a philosophy of [[craft unionism]], while the CIO believed in [[industrial unionism]]. According to the AFL, ''American Can'' decisively tipped NLRB policy in favor of the CIO.</ref>\n\nThe AFL began pushing for an investigation into the NLRB, and this investigation led to allegations of communist influence within the agency. In June 1938, the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (led by Chairman [[Martin Dies Jr.]] [D-[[Texas|TX]]]) heard testimony from AFL leader [[John P. Frey]], who accused Madden of staffing the NLRB with [[Communism|communists]].<ref>\"Reds Start Count of Allies in Federal Jobs and Push Participation in C.I.O., Frey Says.\" ''New York Times''.

October 10, 1938.</ref> The allegations were true, in at least one case: [[Nathan Witt]], the NLRB's executive secretary and the man to whom Madden had delegated most administrative functions, was a member of the [[Communist Party of the United States]].{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|p=667}}{{sfn|Storrs|2013|p=65}} These allegations and discoveries significantly damaged the agency's support in Congress and with the public.\n\nA second investigation into the NLRB led to organizational changes at the board. On July 20, 1939, Republicans and conservative Democrats formed a coalition to push through the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] a resolution establishing a Special Committee to Investigate the National Labor Relations Board (the \"[[J. Warren Madden#The Smith Committee|Smith Committee]]\"), chaired by conservative, anti-labor Rep. [[Howard W. Smith]] (D-[[Virginia|VA]]).{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=151\u201354}}{{sfn|Bernstein|Piven|1969|p=668}} On March 7, 1940, the Smith Committee proposed legislation to abolish the NLRB, reconstitute it, and radically amend the NLRA.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=194\u201399}}<ref>Among the changes proposed:  Removing of many of the guarantees of collective bargaining from the Wagner Act's preamble, denying legal protection to [[sitdown strike]]rs and agricultural workers, removing the requirement that employers must bargain with unions, making the General Counsel independent from the Board, abolishing the board's economic research unit, enhancing employer free speech rights, introducing the right of employers to seek an election among their workers, and removing the board's authority to engage in bargaining unit determination.

On November 15, 1940, President Roosevelt nominated [[Harry A. Millis]] to the NLRB and named him chairman, and nominated Madden to a seat on the U.S. Court of Claims.<ref>\"Dr. Millis Slated to Head the NLRB.\" ''New York Times''.

November 16, 1940.</ref>\n\n===1940\u20131945: The Economics Division and World War II===\nAnother major structural change occurred at the same time that Madden left the NLRB. The Smith committee's anti-communist drive also targeted David J. Saposs, the NLRB Chief Industrial Economist. Saposs had been surreptitiously assessed by members of the Communist Party USA for membership, and rejected as a prospect.{{sfn|Gross|1974|p=220}} But Smith and others attacked Saposs as a communist, and Congress defunded his division and his job on October 11, 1940.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=199, 202}}{{sfn|Jacobs|2007|pp=171\u201372}}{{sfn|Chasse|2011|p=58}} Although the Smith committee's investigation proved critical, the disestablishment of the Economic Division was due to many reasons\u2014both internal and external to the NLRB, and only some of which involved allegations of communist infiltration. As historian James A. Gross observed:.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}}\n<blockquote>The Division was eliminated for all kinds of reasons which had nothing to do with the merits and importance of its work:  political pressures and maneuverings, jealousy and empire building between and among lawyers and economists inside the Board, opposition to leftist ideologies, a personal attack on the Chief Economist, David Saposs, and a mighty hostility to the administrative process.</blockquote>\n\nThe loss of the Economic Division was a major blow to the NLRB.  It had a major tactical impact: Economic data helped the NLRB fulfill its adjudicatorial and prosecutorial work in areas such as [[unfair labor practice]]s (ULPs), representation elections, and in determining remedial actions (such as reinstatement, back pay awards, and fines).{{sfn|Stryker|1989|pp=346\u201347}} Economic data also undermined employer resistance to the agency by linking that opposition to employer ULPs.{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=349}} The loss also left the board dependent on the biased information offered by the parties in dispute before it, leading to poor decision-making and far less success in the courts.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=266\u201367}} It also had a major strategic impact: It left the board unable to determine whether its administration of the law was effective or not.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=265}} Nor could the board determine whether labor unrest was a serious threat to the economy or not. As [[Labor history (discipline)|labor historian]] Josiah Bartlett Lambert put it: \"Without the Economic Research Division, the NLRB could not undertake empirical studies to determine the actual impact of [[Secondary action|secondary boycotts]], [[jurisdictional strike]]s, national emergency strikes, and the like.\"{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=104}} The Economic Division was critical to a long-range NLRB process to lead to the long-term evolution of industrial labor relations in the U.S., but that goal had to be abandoned.{{sfn|Eisner|2000|p=101}}{{sfn|Eisner|2010|pp=336\u201337}} Most importantly, however, the evisceration of the Economic Division struck at the fundamental purpose of federal labor law, which was to allow experts to adjudicate labor disputes rather than use a legal process. With this data and analysis, widespread skepticism about the board's expertise quickly spread through Congress and the courts.  It also left the board largely unable to engage in [[rulemaking]], forcing it to make labor law on an inefficient, time-consuming case-by-case basis.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=266}} As of 1981, NLRB was still the only federal agency forbidden to seek economic information about the impact of its activities.{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=264\u201365}}\n\nThe second Chairman of the NLRB, [[Harry A. Millis]], led the board in a much more moderate direction.{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=104}} Lacking an economic division to give it ammunition to fight with Millis deliberately made the NLRB dependent on Congress and the executive branch for its survival.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=261}} Millis made a large number of organizational changes. He stripped the office of Secretary of its power, set up an Administrative Division to supervise the 22 regional offices, initiated a study of the Board's administrative procedures, and genuinely delegated power to the regional offices.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=229}} He removed casehandling and regional office communication from the jurisdiction of the Office of the Secretary and created a Field Division.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=225}}<ref>Stark, Louis. \"Methods of NLRB Indicated in Study Made By Own Men.\" New York Times. March 22, 1940.</ref> He also adopted procedures requiring the board made its decisions based solely on the trial examiner's report, authorized NLRB review attorneys to review trial examiner report, required decisions to be drafted ahead of time and distributed for review, authorized review attorneys to revise drafts before a final decision was issued, required trial examiners to emphasize findings of fact and to address points of law, and began holding board meetings when there were differences of opinion over decisions.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=225}}\n\nMillis eliminated the Review Division's decisive role in cases, which had been established under Madden and Witt.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=226}} Madden and Witt had adopted a highly centralized Board structure so that (generally speaking) only the cases most favorable to the board made it to the courts. The centralized structure meant that only the strongest cases made it to national board, so that the board could apply all its economic and legal powers to crafting the best decision possible. This strategy enabled the NLRB to defend itself very well before the Supreme Court. But Madden and Witt had held on to the centralized strategy too long, and made political enemies in the process. Millis substituted a decentralized process in which the board was less a decision-maker and more a provider of services to the regions.{{sfn|Tomlins|1985|p=226}} Many of the changes Millis instituted were designed to mimic requirements placed on other agencies by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]].{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}}\n\nAmerican entry into World War II on December 8, 1941, significantly changed the NLRB. On January 12, 1942, President Roosevelt created the [[National War Labor Board (1942\u20131945)|National War Labor Board]] (NWLB), which displaced the NLRB as the main focus of federal labor relations for the duration of the war. The NWLB was given the authority to \"finally determine\" any labor dispute which threatened to interrupt war production, and to stabilize union wages and benefits during the war. Although Roosevelt instructed the NWLB not to intrude on jurisdiction exercised by the NLRB, the War Labor Board refused to honor this request. From 1942 to 1945, Millis tried to secure a jurisdictional agreement with NWLB Chairman George W. Taylor. But these discussions proved fruitless, and Millis broke them off in June 1945. The NWLB also heavily raided the NLRB for staff, significantly hindering NLRB operations.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=243}}\n\nAdditional changes came with the passage of the [[War Labor Disputes Act]] (WLDA) on June 25, 1943. Enacted over Roosevelt's veto after 400,000 coal miners, their wages significantly lower due to high wartime inflation, struck for a $2-a-day wage increase,{{sfn|Malsberger|2000|p=104}}{{sfn|Karatnycky|2000|p=115}} the legislation (in part) required the NLRB to issue a ballot outlining all the collective bargaining proposals and counter-proposals, wait 30 days, and then hold a strike vote.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=244}} The War Labor Disputes Act proved very burdensome.  The NLRB processed 2,000 WLDA cases from 1943 to the end of 1945, of which 500 were strike votes. The act's strike vote procedures did little to stop strikes, however, and Millis feared unions were using the referendums to whip up pro-strike feelings among their members. Millis also believed the law's strike vote process permitted more strikes to occur than the NLRB would have allowed under its old procedures. There were so many strike vote filings in the six months after the war ended that NLRB actually shut down its long-distance telephone lines, cancelled all out of town travel, suspended all public hearings, and suspended all other business to accommodate the workload.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=245}} By early 1945, Millis was in ill health.<ref>\"Dr. H.A. Millis Dies.\" ''New York Times.'' June 26, 1948.</ref>  He resigned from the NLRB on June 7, 1945,<ref>\"In Administration Shake-Up\", ''Associated Press,'' June 8, 1945.</ref> and [[Paul M. Herzog]] was named his successor.\n\n===1947\u20131965: Taft\u2013Hartley===\nA major turning point in the history of the NLRB came in 1947 with passage of the [[Taft\u2013Hartley Act]]. Disruptions caused by strikes during World War II as well as the huge wave of strikes that followed the end of the war fueled a growing movement in 1946 and 1947 to amend the NLRA to correct what critics saw as a pro-labor tilt in federal law.<ref>Stark, Louis. \"Save Bargaining, Keep Peace In Industry, Says NLRB Head.\" ''New York Times.'' March 7, 1947.</ref>{{sfn|Gross|1981|pp=251\u201352}} Drafted by the powerful Republican Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] and the strongly anti-union Representative [[Fred A. Hartley Jr.]], the Taft\u2013Hartley Act banned jurisdictional strikes, [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]], political strikes, [[Secondary action|secondary boycotts]], secondary picketing, mass picketing, union campaign donations made from dues money, the [[closed shop]], and unions of supervisors. The act also enumerated new employer rights, defined union-committed ULPs, gave states the right to opt out of federal labor law through [[right-to-work law]]s, required unions to give an 80-days' strike notice in all cases, established procedures for the President to end a strike in a national emergency, and required all union officials to sign an anti-Communist oath. Organizationally, the act made the General Counsel a presidential appointee, independent of the board itself, and gave the General Counsel limited powers to seek injunctions without referring to the Justice Department. It also banned the NLRB from engaging in any mediation or conciliation, and formally enshrined in law the ban on hiring personnel to do economic data collection or analysis.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}}\n\nIn August 1947, [[Robert N. Denham]] became the NLRB's [[general counsel]]. He held \"conservative views\" and wielded \"considerable influence\" on labor-management relations and interpretations of the newly passed Taft\u2013Hartley Act. In 1950, US President [[Harry S. Truman]] fired Denham (''New York Times'': \"left at the behest of the President\").<ref name=DenhamPapers>{{cite web\n| title = Denham, Robert N.

He felt the communist oath provisions were unconstitutional, that the amendments would turn the NLRA into a management weapon, that creation of an independent General Counsel would weaken the NLRB, and that the law's dismantling of the agency's economic analysis unit deprived the NLRB of essential expertise.{{sfn|Gross|2010|pp=11\u201313}} Nonetheless, Congress overrode Truman's veto of the Taft\u2013Hartley Act on June 23, 1947, and the bill became law.{{sfn|Lee|1980|pp=101\u201303}}\n\nThe Taft\u2013Hartley Act fundamentally changed the nature of federal labor law, but it also seriously hindered the NLRB's ability to enforce the law. The loss of the mediation function left the NLRB unable to become involved in labor disputes, a function it had engaged in since its inception as the National Labor Board in 1933. This hindered the agency's efforts to study, analyze, and create bulwarks against [[Good faith|bad-faith]] [[collective bargaining]]; reduced its ability to formulate national labor policy in this area; and left the agency making labor law on an ineffective, time-consuming case-by-case basis.{{sfn|Lambert|2005|p=104}} The separation of the General Counsel from supervision by the national board also had significant impact on the agency. This separation was enacted against the advice of the Justice Department, contradicted the policy Congress had enacted in the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, and ignored Millis' extensive internal reforms. The change left the NLRB as the only federal agency unable to coordinate its decision-making and legal activities, and the only agency exempted in this manner under the Administrative Procedure Act. The separation of the General Counsel was not discussed by the committee or by any witnesses during the legislation's mark-up. Indeed, there was no basis for it at all in the public record.{{sfn|Gross|1981|p=264}} It was, in the words of sociologist Robin Stryker, \"little-noted\" and \"unprecedented\".{{sfn|Stryker|1989|p=344}}\n\nThe anti-communist oath provisions generated extensive public debate, and generated disputes before the Supreme Court several times. The Taft\u2013Hartley oath first reached the court in ''[[American Communications Ass'n v. Douds]]'', {{Ussc|339|382|1950|el=no}}, in which the court held 5-to-1 that the oath did not violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], was not an ''[[ex post facto]]'' law or [[bill of attainder]] in violation of [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article One, Section 10]], and was not a \"test oath\" in violation of [[Article Six of the United States Constitution#Oaths|Article Six]]. The issue again came before the court in ''[[Garner v. Board of Public Works]]'', {{Ussc|341|716|1951|el=no}}, in which the court unanimously held that a municipal [[loyalty oath]] was not an ''ex post facto law'' or bill of attainder. It came before the court yet a third time in ''Wieman v. Updegraff'', {{Ussc|344|183|1952|el=no}}. This time, the outcome was radically different. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that state loyalty oath legislation violated the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. In 1965, the Supreme Court held 5-to-4 that the anti-communist oath was a bill of attainder in ''[[United States v. Brown (1965)|United States v. Brown]]'', {{Ussc|381|437|1965|el=no}}.<ref>\"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause.\" ''Virginia Law Review''.

The 1935 Wagner Act had protected non-profit hospital workers, but the Taft\u2013Hartley Act removed those protections in 1947. Congress had expressed concern about the impact of potential labor strikes on patient care, but decided that the proposed legislation was an appropriate compromise.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|title=1974 Health Care Amendments |publisher=National Labor Relations Board|url=https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/who-we-are/our-history/1974-health-care-amendments|access-date=2021-02-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Board|first=United States National Labor Relations|date=1986|title=NLRB, the first 50 years: the story of the National Labor Relations Board, 1935-1985.|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc6386/m1/2/|access-date=2021-02-11|publisher=UNT Digital Library|language=English}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1987, the Board began work on a comprehensive regulation for collective-bargaining units in health care organizations.

In broad terms, the General Counsel is responsible for investigating and prosecuting [[unfair labor practice]] claims and for the general supervision of the NLRB field offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlrb.gov/who-we-are/general-counsel|title=The General Counsel - NLRB|website=www.nlrb.gov|access-date=2017-04-21|archive-date=2017-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427024547/https://www.nlrb.gov/who-we-are/general-counsel|url-status=live}}</ref> The General Counsel is appointed by the President to a four-year term and independent from the Board; it has limited independence to argue for a change in the law in presenting cases to the Board. The General Counsel oversees four divisions: the Division of Operations Management, the Division of Administration, the Division of Advice, and the Division of Enforcement Litigation.\n\nThe Board, on the other hand, is the adjudicative body that decides the unfair labor practice cases brought to it. Once the Board has decided the issue, it is the General Counsel's responsibility to uphold the Board's decision, even if it is contrary to the position it advocated when presenting the case to the Board. The Board is also responsible for the administration of the Act's provisions governing the holding of elections and resolution of jurisdictional disputes. It is a reactive and not a proactive power. The NLRB rarely promulgates administrative rules.<ref>''Chamber of Comm. v. NLRB'', 721 F.3d 152 (4th Cir. 2011).</ref>\n\nThe Board has more than thirty regional offices. The regional offices conduct elections, investigate unfair labor practice charges, and make the initial determination on those charges (whether to dismiss, settle, or issue complaints). The Board has jurisdiction to hold elections and prosecute violations of the Act in [[Puerto Rico]] and [[American Samoa]].\n\n===Jurisdiction===\nThe Board's [[jurisdiction]] is limited to [[private sector]] employees and the [[United States Postal Service]]; other than Postal Service employees, it has no authority over labor relations disputes involving governmental, [[railroad]] and [[airline]] employees covered by the [[Adamson Railway Labor Act]], or agricultural employees. On the other hand, in those parts of the private sector its jurisdictional standards are low enough to reach almost all employers whose business has any appreciable impact on [[interstate commerce]].\n\n===Processing of charges===\nCharges are filed by parties against unions or employers with the appropriate regional office. The regional office will investigate the complaint. If a violation is believed to exist, the region will take the case before an [[Administrative Law Judge]] who will conduct a hearing. The decision of the Administrative Law Judge may be reviewed by the five member Board. Board decisions are reviewable by [[United States Courts of Appeals]]. The Board's decisions are not self-executing: it must seek court enforcement in order to force a recalcitrant party to comply with its orders.<ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14047118090169598295 Mitchellace, Inc. v.
