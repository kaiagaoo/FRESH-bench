French President [[Georges Pompidou]] abruptly died, leading to a [[1974 French presidential election|fresh presidential election]] that was closely won by [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]]. West German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], American President [[Richard Nixon]], and Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] all resigned due to scandals. In the United Kingdom, a [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|hung election]] led to a minority government whose subsequent instability prompted [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|another election the same year]]. Consequently, Nixon's successor, [[Gerald Ford]], proposed a retreat the following year for the group's new leaders to learn about one another.\n\n=== First summit and expansion ===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R.
