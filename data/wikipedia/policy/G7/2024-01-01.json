On 25 March 1973, the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], [[George Shultz]], convened an informal gathering of [[finance ministers]] from West Germany ([[Helmut Schmidt]]), France ([[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]]), and the United Kingdom ([[Anthony Barber]]) before an upcoming meeting in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]].

French President [[Georges Pompidou]] abruptly died, leading to a [[1974 French presidential election|fresh presidential election]] that was closely won by [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]]. West German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], American President [[Richard Nixon]], and Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] all resigned due to scandals. In the United Kingdom, a [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|hung election]] led to a minority government whose subsequent instability prompted [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|another election the same year]].

The Trump administration had just imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on many countries, including European countries that are fellow members of the G7, and Canada, the host country for the 2018 meeting. Trump expressed dismay at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for holding a press conference in which Canada restated its position on tariffs (a public criticism of Trump's economic policy), and directed his representatives at the meeting not to sign the economic section of the joint communiqu\u00e9 that is typically issued at the conclusion of the meeting.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel described Trump's behaviour as a \"depressing withdrawal\", while French President Emmanuel Macron invited him \"to be serious\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://tg24.sky.it/mondo/2018/06/10/g7-canada-trump.html|title=G7, Trump non-accetta il documento finale.

The Italian Prime Minister [[Giuseppe Conte]] supported Trump's proposal, [[Shinzo Abe]] of Japan was neutral, and the rest of the G7 pushed back against the suggestion, after which the atmosphere allegedly became \"tense\". {{citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n\n=== 2019 Amazon rainforest fires and Brazil ===\n{{further|45th G7 summit|2019 Brazil wildfires}}\nU.S. President [[Donald Trump]]'s reiteration that Russia should be readmitted to the group (see above), the instigation of a [[trade war]] with China, increased tensions in Iran, Trump's alleged reluctance to attend the conference, and a number of international crises made the 2019 G7 meeting in [[Biarritz]], France, the most divided since its inception. Following President Trump's previous revocation of his signature to a joint communiqu\u00e9 agreed to in 2018 due to an alleged slight from Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] (see above), French President [[Emmanuel Macron]] agreed that the group would not issue a joint communiqu\u00e9 at the Biarritz conference.\n\nThe G7 nations pledged US$20 million to help Brazil and other countries in South America fight the wildfires. This money was welcomed, although it was widely seen as a \"relatively small amount\" given the scale of the problem. Macron threatened to block a major trade deal between the European Union and Brazil ([[Mercosur]]) that would benefit the agricultural interests accused of driving deforestation. Soon after, Germany and the United Kingdom criticized the threat.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g7-summit-mercosur-idUSKCN1VE0ON/| title=Britain joins Germany in criticizing Macron's Mercosur threat| publisher=Thomson Reuters| date=25 August 2019| access-date=30 December 2023}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Build Back Better World]]\n* [[Capitalism]]\n* [[D-10 Strategy Forum]]\n* [[Developed country]]\n* [[Big Four (Western Europe)|G4 (EU)]]\n* [[G6 (EU)]]\n* [[G8]]\n* [[G8+5]]\n* [[G10 currencies]]\n* [[G20]]\n* [[Great power]]\n* [[Group of Twelve]] (G12)\n* [[Junior 8]]\n* [[List of country groupings]]\n* [[List of G7 leaders]]\n* [[List of multilateral free trade agreements]]\n* [[OECD]]\n* [[Quint (international organization)|Quint]]\n{{col div end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Group of Seven}}\n{{wikinews|Economic policy makers conclude Washington meetings}}\n* [https://www.g7hiroshima.go.jp/en/ 2023 G7 presidency Japan]\n* [https://www.g7germany.de/ 2022 G7 presidency Germany]\n* [https://www.g7uk.org/ 2021 G7 presidency UK]\n* [http://www.g8.utoronto.ca G7/8 Information Centre \u2013 University of Toronto]\n* [https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/international-cooperation/international-organisations/g7_en/ The EU engages in actions and discussions with other members of the G7 on topics relating to agriculture]\n\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{Group of 7}}\n{{Current G7 Heads of State}}\n{{Current G7 Leaders}}\n{{G7-Foreign}}\n{{G7-Finance}}\n{{G8-Defense}}\n{{G7-Interior}}\n{{G7-Justice}}\n{{G7-Central Bank}}\n{{G7 summits}}\n{{International power}}\n{{Western culture}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:G7 summits| ]]\n[[Category:Intergovernmental organizations]]\n[[Category:International economic organizations]]\n[[Category:Economic country classifications]]\n[[Category:20th-century diplomatic conferences]]\n[[Category:21st-century diplomatic conferences (Global)]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1975]]"}
