The Paris Agreement was negotiated by 196 [[party (law)|parties]] at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] near [[Paris]], France. As of February 2023, 195 members of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) are parties to the agreement. Of the three UNFCCC member states which have not [[Ratification|ratified]] the agreement, the only major emitter is [[Iran]]. The [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|United States withdrew]] from the agreement in 2020,<ref name=\"UScom\" /> but rejoined in 2021.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\nThe Paris Agreement has a long-term temperature goal which is to keep the rise in [[global surface temperature]] to well below {{convert|2|C-change}} above [[Industrial Revolution|pre-industrial]] levels. The treaty also states that preferably the limit of the increase should only be {{convert|1.5|C-change}}. The lower the temperature increase, the smaller the [[effects of climate change]] can be expected. To achieve this temperature goal, [[greenhouse gas emissions]] should be reduced as soon as, and by as much as, possible. They should even reach [[net-zero emissions|net zero]] by the middle of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|last=UNFCCC|title=The Paris Agreement|url=https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement|url-status=live|access-date=18 September 2021|website=unfccc.int|archive-date=19 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210319205057/https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement}}</ref> To stay below 1.5{{Nbsp}}\u00b0C of global warming, emissions need to be cut by roughly 50% by 2030.

Under the agreement, each country must determine, plan, and [[Enhanced Transparency Framework|regularly report]] on its contributions. No mechanism forces a country to set specific [[emissions target]]s, but each target should go beyond previous targets. In contrast to the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]], the distinction between developed and developing countries is blurred, so that the latter also have to submit plans for emission reductions.\n\nThe Paris Agreement was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 ([[Earth Day]]) at a ceremony inside the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN Headquarters]] in [[New York City|New York]]. After the [[European Union]] ratified the agreement, sufficient countries had ratified the agreement responsible for enough of the [[greenhouse gas emissions|world's greenhouse gases]] for the agreement to enter into force on 4 November 2016.\n\nWorld leaders have lauded the agreement.<ref name=\"auto2\" /> However, some environmentalists and analysts have criticized it, saying it is not strict enough. There is debate about the effectiveness of the agreement. While pledges under the Paris Agreement are insufficient for reaching the set temperature goals, there is a mechanism of [[Global stocktake|increased ambition]]. The Paris Agreement has been successfully used in [[Climate change litigation|climate litigation]] forcing countries and an oil company to strengthen climate action.<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" />{{outdated inline|date=November 2024}}\n{{TOC level|3}}\n\n== Aims ==\nThe aim of the agreement, as described in Article 2, is to have a stronger response to the danger of climate change; it seeks to enhance the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change through:<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=Paris Agreement, FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1 |url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212194411/http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf |archive-date=12 December 2015 |access-date=12 December 2015 |work=UNFCCC secretariat }}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|(a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5&nbsp;\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;\n\n(b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster [[climate resilience]] and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production;\n\n(c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.}}\n\nCountries furthermore aim to reach \"global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:GUSTAVO-CAMACHO-GONZALEZ-L1060274 (23430273715).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Heads of delegations at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris]]\n\n===Lead-up===\nThe [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), adopted at the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] is one of the first international treaties on the topic.
