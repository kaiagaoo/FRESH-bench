Adopted in 2015, the agreement covers [[climate change mitigation]], [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]], and [[Climate finance|finance]]. The Paris Agreement was negotiated by 196 [[party (law)|parties]] at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] near [[Paris, France]]. As of September 2022, 194 members of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) are parties to the agreement. Of the four UNFCCC member states which have not [[Ratification|ratified]] the agreement, the only major emitter is Iran. The United States withdrew from the Agreement in 2020, but rejoined in 2021.\n\nThe Paris Agreement was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 ([[Earth Day]]) at a ceremony in [[New York (state)|New York]]. After the [[European Union]] ratified the agreement, sufficient countries had ratified the Agreement responsible for enough of the [[greenhouse gas emissions|world's greenhouse gases]] for the Agreement to enter into force on 4 November 2016. \n\nThe Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal is to keep the rise in mean global temperature to well below {{convert|2|C-change}} above pre-industrial levels, and preferably limit the increase to {{convert|1.5|C-change}}, recognizing that this would substantially reduce the [[effects of climate change]]. Emissions should be reduced as soon as possible and reach [[net-zero emissions|net-zero]] by the middle of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|last=UNFCCC|title=The Paris Agreement|url=https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement|url-status=live|access-date=18 September 2021|website=unfccc.int|archive-date=19 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210319205057/https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement}}</ref> To stay below 1.5{{Nbsp}}\u00b0C of global warming, emissions need to be cut by roughly 50% by 2030.

Under the Agreement, each country must determine, plan, and [[Enhanced Transparency Framework|regularly report]] on its contributions. No mechanism forces a country to set specific [[emissions target]]s, but each target should go beyond previous targets. In contrast to the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]], the distinction between developed and developing countries is blurred, so that the latter also have to submit plans for emission reductions.\n\nThe Agreement was lauded by world leaders, but criticised as insufficiently binding by some environmentalists and analysts. There is debate about the effectiveness of the Agreement. While [[Nationally Determined Contributions|current pledges]] under the Paris Agreement are insufficient for reaching the set temperature goals, there is a mechanism of [[Global stocktake|increased ambition]]. The Paris Agreement has been successfully used in [[Climate change litigation|climate litigation]] forcing countries and an oil company to strengthen climate action. On 4 July 2022, the [[Supreme Federal Court]] of [[Brazil]] recognized the Paris agreement as a [[Human rights treaty bodies|human rights treaty]].<ref name=\"stf-jus-jul22\">{{cite web|title=Argui\u00e7\u00e3o de descumprimento de preceito fundamental|language=pt|url=https://portal.stf.jus.br/processos/detalhe.asp?incidente=5951856|website=[[Supremo Tribunal Federal]]|access-date=24 July 2022|archive-date=24 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220724145637/https://portal.stf.jus.br/processos/detalhe.asp?incidente=5951856}}</ref><ref name=\"yale-bra-jul22\">{{cite web |last1=Ciuffo |first1=Leandro Neumann |title=Brazil's High Court First to Declare Paris Agreement a Human Rights Treaty |url=https://e360.yale.edu/digest/paris-agreement-human-rights-treaty-brazil |website=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication |date=7 July 2022|access-date=21 July 2022|archive-date=24 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220724144613/https://e360.yale.edu/digest/paris-agreement-human-rights-treaty-brazil}}</ref>\n{{TOC level|3}}\n\n==Development==\n[[File:GUSTAVO-CAMACHO-GONZALEZ-L1060274 (23430273715).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Heads of delegations at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris]]\n\n===Lead-up===\nThe [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), adopted at the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] is one of the first international treaties on the topic.

The Paris Agreement has provisions for an enhanced framework for capacity building, recognises the varying circumstances of countries, and notes that the technical expert review for each country consider that country's specific capacity for reporting.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite web|last=Van Asselt|first=Harro|date=2016|title=Putting the 'enhanced transparency framework' into action: Priorities for a key pillar of the Paris Agreement|url=https://mediamanager.sei.org/documents/Publications/Climate/SEI-PB-2016-Transparency-under-Paris-Agreement.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119062033/https://www.sei-international.org/mediamanager/documents/Publications/Climate/SEI-PB-2016-Transparency-under-Paris-Agreement.pdf|archive-date=19 November 2016|website=Stockholm Environment Institute}}</ref> Parties to the Agreement send their first Biennial Transparency Report (BTR), and [[greenhouse gas inventory]] figures to the UNFCCC by 2024 and every two years after that.

It would involve improvements to [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] to decrease the [[energy intensity]] of the global economy. Implementation also requires fossil fuel burning to be cut back and the share of [[sustainable energy]] to grow rapidly. Emissions are being reduced rapidly in the electricity sector, but not in the building, transport and heating sector. Some industries are difficult to decarbonise, and for those [[carbon dioxide removal]] may be necessary to achieve [[Carbon neutrality|net-zero emissions]].<ref name=\":14\" /> In a report released in 2022 the IPCC promotes the need for innovation and technological changes in combination with consumption and production behavioral changes to meet Paris Agreement objectives.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/about/frequently-asked-questions/ |access-date=2022-04-04 |website=www.ipcc.ch |language=en}}</ref>\n\nTo stay below 1.5{{Nbsp}}\u00b0C of global warming, emissions need to be cut by roughly 50% by 2030. This is an aggregate of each country's [[nationally determined contribution]]s. By mid-century, {{CO2}} emissions would need to be cut to zero, and total greenhouse gases would net to be net-zero just after mid-century.<ref name=\":17\"/>\n\nThere are barriers to implementing the Agreement. Some countries struggle to attract the finance necessary for investments in decarbonisation. Climate finance is fragmented, further complicating investments. Another issue is the lack of capabilities in government and other institutions to implement policy.
