He [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|was nominated by]] President [[George H. W. Bush]] to succeed [[Thurgood Marshall]] and has served since 1991. After Marshall, Thomas is the second [[African Americans|African American]] to serve on the Supreme Court and has been its longest-serving member since [[Anthony Kennedy]]'s retirement in 2018. Since [[Stephen Breyer]]'s retirement in 2022, he is also the Court's oldest member.\n\nThomas was born in [[Pin Point, Georgia]]. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor [[Gullah]] community near [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a [[priest]] in the [[Catholic Church]] but was frustrated over the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a [[clergyman]] to attend the [[College of the Holy Cross]] and [[Yale Law School]], where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, notably [[Thomas Sowell]]. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an [[Missouri Attorney General|assistant attorney general]] in [[Missouri]] and later entered private practice there. He became a [[legislative assistant]] to U.S. Senator [[John Danforth]] in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] in 1981. President [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed Thomas as Chairman of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) the next year.\n\nPresident George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed [[Anita Hill]], a subordinate at the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the EEOC.{{Sfn|Alexander Jr.|1997|p=378}} Hill alleged that Thomas made multiple inappropriate sexual and romantic overtures to her; Thomas and his supporters alleged that Hill and her political supporters had fabricated the accusation to prevent the appointment of a black conservative. The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52\u201348, the narrowest margin in a century.<ref name=\"Senate.gov\">{{cite news |title= Roll Call Vote 102nd Congress - 1st Session |publisher=U.S. Senate |date= October 15, 1991 |url= https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=102&session=1&vote=00220 |access-date= May 19, 2020 |archive-date= April 7, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180407085736/https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=102&session=1&vote=00220 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nSince the death of [[Antonin Scalia]], Thomas has been the Court's foremost [[originalism|originalist]], stressing the [[original meaning]] in interpreting the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]].{{Sfn|Staab|2022|p=2}} In contrast to Scalia\u2014who had been the only other consistent originalist\u2014he pursues a more [[Classical liberalism|classically liberal]] variety of originalism.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sandefur |first=Timothy |date=2008-09-22 |title=Clarence Thomas's Jurisprudence Unexplained |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1272053 |journal=New York University Journal of Law & Liberty |language=en |location=Rochester, N.Y. |pages=535\u2013556|ssrn=1272053 }}</ref> Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,{{Sfn|Maggs|2017|p=215}} though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Severino |first=Carrie |author-link=Carrie Severino |date=2021-08-18 |title=Justice Thomas has made the new oral argument format a winner |url=https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/08/justice-thomas-has-made-the-new-oral-argument-format-a-winner/ |access-date=2022-07-09 |website=[[SCOTUSblog]] |language=en-US}}</ref> He is notable for his majority opinions in ''[[Good News Club v.

The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, {{usc|18|982}}(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent.
