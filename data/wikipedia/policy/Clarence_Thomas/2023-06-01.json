He [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|was nominated by]] President [[George H. W. Bush]] to succeed [[Thurgood Marshall]] and has served since 1991. After Marshall, Thomas is the second [[African Americans|African American]] to serve on the Court and is its longest-serving member since [[Anthony Kennedy]]'s retirement in 2018. Since [[Stephen Breyer]]'s retirement in 2022, he is the Court's oldest member.\n\nThomas was born in [[Pin Point, Georgia]]. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor [[Gullah]] community near [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a [[priest]] in the [[Catholic Church]] but was frustrated over the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a [[clergyman]] to attend the [[College of the Holy Cross]] and, later, [[Yale Law School]], where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, notably [[Thomas Sowell]]. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an [[Missouri Attorney General|assistant attorney general]] in [[Missouri]] and later entered private practice there. He became a [[legislative assistant]] to U.S. Senator [[John Danforth]] in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] in 1981. President [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed Thomas as Chairman of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) the next year.\n\nPresident George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] [[Anita Hill]], a subordinate at the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the EEOC. Hill alleged that Thomas made multiple sexual and romantic overtures to her despite her repeatedly telling him to stop. Thomas and his supporters denied the allegation, asserting that Hill and her political supporters had fabricated the accusation to prevent the appointment of a black conservative to the Court. The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52\u201348, the narrowest margin in a century.<ref name=\"Senate.gov\">{{cite news |title= Roll Call Vote 102nd Congress - 1st Session |publisher=U.S. Senate |date= October 15, 1991 |url= https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=102&session=1&vote=00220 |access-date= May 19, 2020 |archive-date= April 7, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180407085736/https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=102&session=1&vote=00220 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nSince the death of [[Antonin Scalia]], Thomas has been the Court's foremost [[originalism|originalist]], stressing the [[original meaning]] in interpreting the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]].

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives'' (2019), a case challenging the Trump administration's ban on [[bump stock]]s. Only Thomas and Gorsuch publicly dissented.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/040519zr_6k47.pdf |title=Guedes, Damien, et al. v.

Bruen]]'' (2022), guaranteeing the right of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in public. The case held: \"When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.'\" Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], dissenting, wrote, \"when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms.\"\n\n==== Fourth Amendment ====\nIn cases regarding the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which prohibits unreasonable [[search and seizure|searches and seizures]], Thomas often favors police over defendants. For example, his opinion for the Court in ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the Court in ''[[Samson v. California]]'', permitting random searches on parolees. He dissented in ''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'', which prohibited [[Warrantless searches in the United States|warrantless searches]] that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the Court's decision in ''[[Coolidge v. New Hampshire]]'' controlled the case. In ''[[City of Indianapolis v. Edmond|Indianapolis v. Edmond]]'', Thomas described the Court's extant case law as having held that \"suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops.\" He expressed doubt that those cases were decided correctly but concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the Court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.<ref>''[[Indianapolis v. Edmond]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/99-1030.html 531 U.S. 32 (2000)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720182043/http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/99-1030.html |date=July 20, 2008 }}. Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.</ref> Thomas was in the majority in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'', which held that the use of [[Thermography|thermal imaging]] technology to probe a suspect's home without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\nIn cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'',{{sfn|Robin|2019|p=194}} which he defines as \"parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order\".<ref name=\"Safford\" /> His dissent in ''[[Safford Unified School District v. Redding]]'' illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the ''Safford'' case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the Court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a [[strip search]] or the like.<ref name=\"Safford\">''[[Safford Unified School District v. Redding]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/08-479.html 557 U. S. __ (2009).

The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. Thomas wrote, \"It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not\"<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105896007&sc=fb&cc=fp \"Court Says Strip Search of Ariz.

He added, \"[t]here can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search.\"<ref name=\"Safford\" />\n\n==== Sixth Amendment ====\nIn ''[[Doggett v. United States]]'', the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The Court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] right to a [[speedy trial]], finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.<ref name=\"Doggett\">''[[Doggett v. United States]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/505/647.html 505 U.S. 647 (1992)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211108151427/https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ |date=November 8, 2021 }}. Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.</ref> Thomas dissented, arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause's purpose was to prevent \"'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'\" and that the case implicated neither.<ref name=\"Doggett\" /> He cast the case instead as \"present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime\". Thomas dissented from the court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.<ref name=\"Doggett\" /> He wrote that dismissing the conviction \"invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role\".{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|p=123}}\n\nIn ''[[Garza v. Idaho]]'', Thomas and Gorsuch, in dissent, suggested that ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' (1963), which required that indigent criminal defendants be provided counsel, was wrongly decided and should be overruled.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/politics/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-precedent.html|title=Precedent, Meet Clarence Thomas.

Virginia]]'' and ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'', which held that the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] prohibits the application of the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] to certain classes of persons. In ''[[Kansas v. Marsh]]'', his opinion for the Court indicated a belief that the Constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' and ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'', the 1976 case in which the Court reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn ''[[Hudson v. McMillian]]'', a prisoner had been beaten, sustaining a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. Although these were not \"serious injuries\", the Court believed, it held that \"the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute [[cruel and unusual punishment]] even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\"<ref name=\"Hudson\">''[[Hudson v. McMillian]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=503&page=1 503 U.S. 1 (1992)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310230639/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=503&page=1 |date=March 10, 2007 }}</ref> Dissenting, Thomas wrote, \"a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents.\"<ref name=\"Hudson\" /> Thomas's vote\u2014in one of his first cases after joining the Court\u2014was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|p=119}} His opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, it ignored \"the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment\".<ref name=\"Hudson\" /> According to historian [[David Garrow]], Thomas's dissent in ''Hudson'' was a \"classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by [[Felix Frankfurter]] and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him\".<ref name=\"Garrow\">[[David Garrow|Garrow, David]] (October 25, 2004), [http://www.davidgarrow-com.hb2hosting.net/File/DJG%202004%20TNRCTFoskettReview.pdf \"Saving Thomas\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142836/http://www.davidgarrow-com.hb2hosting.net/File/DJG%202004%20TNRCTFoskettReview.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}, ''[[The New Republic]]''</ref> Thomas later responded to the accusation \"that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion.\"<ref name=\"Garrow\" />\n\nIn ''[[United States v. Bajakajian]]'', Thomas joined with the Court's liberal justices to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, {{usc|18|982}}(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was \"grossly disproportional\" and violated the [[Excessive Fines Clause]].<ref>''[[United States v. Bajakajian]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=000&invol=96-1487 524 U.S. 321] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419233452/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=000&invol=96-1487 |date=April 19, 2010 }} (1998).</ref>\n\nThomas has written that the \"Cruel and Unusual Punishment\" clause \"contains no proportionality principle\", meaning that the question whether a sentence should be rejected as \"cruel and unusual\" depends only on the sentence itself, not on what crime is being punished.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-08/14-proportionality.html|title=Proportionality|website=Justia Law|access-date=December 27, 2019|archive-date=December 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227065627/https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-08/14-proportionality.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He was concurring with the Court's decision to reject a request for review from a petitioner who had been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison under California's \"Three-Strikes\" law for stealing some golf clubs because the combined value of the clubs made the theft a felony and he had two previous felonies in his criminal record.\n\n==== Race, equal protection, and affirmative action ====\n[[File:Clarence Thomas official.jpg|thumb|Official portrait, 2004]]\nThomas believes the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In ''[[Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a|Adarand Constructors v. Pe\u00f1a]]'', for example, he wrote, \"there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\"<ref>''[[Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.
