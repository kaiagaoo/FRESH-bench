[[Title I of the Patriot Act|Titles 1]], [[Title II of the Patriot Act|2]], and [[Title IX of the Patriot Act|9]] specifically authorized measures that would be taken by the NSA.

Its mission was to eavesdrop on the radio traffic of [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese army]] and [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|air force]] units in southern China, especially in and around the city of [[Kunming]] in [[Yunnan]] Province. In the late 1970s, the base consisted only of a small CDAA antenna array that was remote-controlled via satellite from the NSA listening post at [[Kunia Camp, Hawaii|Kunia, Hawaii]], and a small force of civilian contractors from [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix Field Engineering Corp.]] whose job it was to keep the antenna array and satellite relay facilities up and running 24/7.<ref name=MattAid /> According to the papers of the late General William Odom, the INDRA facility was upgraded in 1986 with a new British-made PUSHER CDAA antenna as part of an overall upgrade of NSA and Thai SIGINT facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.<ref name=MattAid /> The base fell into disrepair in the 1990s as China and Vietnam became more friendly towards the US, and by 2002 archived satellite imagery showed that the PUSHER CDAA antenna had been torn down, perhaps indicating that the base had been closed. At some point in the period since [[9/11]], the Khon Kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable SATCOM intercept mission. It is likely that the NSA presence at Khon Kaen is relatively small, and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors.<ref name=MattAid />\n\n== Research and development ==\nNSA has been involved in debates about public policy, both indirectly as a behind-the-scenes adviser to other departments, and directly during and after [[Bobby Ray Inman|Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman]]'s directorship. NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the [[export of cryptography in the United States]]. Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996. Its secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas, including the design of specialized communications [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software, production of dedicated [[semiconductor]]s at the [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Ft. Meade]] chip fabrication plant), and advanced [[cryptography]] research. For 50 years, the NSA designed and built most of its in-house computer equipment, but from the 1990s until about 2003 (when the U.S. Congress curtailed the practice), the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congress curbs NSA's power to contract with suppliers|author=Sabar, Ariel|date=July 20, 2013|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/2003/07/20/congress-curbs-nsas-power-to-contract-with-suppliers/|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|access-date=June 17, 2013|archive-date=May 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510235528/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-07-20/news/0307200276_1_nsa-eavesdropping-agency|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Data Encryption Standard ===\n{{Main|Data Encryption Standard}}\n[[File:Frostburg.jpg|thumb|[[FROSTBURG]] was the NSA's first [[supercomputer]], used from 1991 to 1997]]\n\nNSA was embroiled in some controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a standard and public [[block cipher]] [[algorithm]] used by the [[U.S. government]] and banking community.<ref name=outofthecloset>{{cite web |url=https://cryptome.org/2021/04/Joseph-Meyer-IEEE-1977.pdf |title=The NSA Comes Out of the Closet: The Debate over Public Cryptography in the Inman Era (U) |work=Cryptologic Quarterly |publisher=U.S. National Security Agency |quote=Public cryptography issues were overwhelming Inman and the NSA.
