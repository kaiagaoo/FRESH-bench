However, when it comes to the nuclear aspects after ten years and the non-nuclear aspects, we would be better off without it.\" Then Schumer assessed the Iranian government, saying, \"Who's to say this dictatorship will not prevail for another ten, twenty, or thirty years? To me, the very real risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goals is too great.\" Finally, Schumer concluded: \"I will vote to disapprove the agreement, not because I believe war is a viable or desirable option, nor to challenge the path of diplomacy. It is because I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power.\"<ref name=\"schumer\" />\n\nIn the same 5 August speech, Obama said, \"Just because Iranian hard-liners chant '[[Death to America]]' does not mean that that's what all Iranians believe.
