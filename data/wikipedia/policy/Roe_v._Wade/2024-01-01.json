Wade'' reached the Supreme Court when both sides appealed in 1970. The case continued under the name ''Roe v. Wade'' instead of being switched to ''Wade v. Roe''. The justices delayed taking action on ''Roe'' and a closely related case, ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', until they had first decided certain other cases. One case they decided first was ''[[Younger v. Harris]]''. The justices felt the appeals raised difficult questions on judicial [[jurisdiction]].\n\nAnother case was ''[[United States v. Vuitch]]'', in which they considered the constitutionality of a [[Washington D.C.|District of Columbia]] statute which banned abortion except when the mother's life or health was endangered. The Court upheld the statute on the grounds that the word \"health\" was not [[Vagueness doctrine#Unconstitutional vagueness|unconstitutionally vague]] and placed the [[Burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] concerning dangers to the life or health of the mother on the prosecutor instead of on the person who had performed the abortion.<ref>[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/402/62/ ''United States v.

He argued that the right to marital privacy and the limitation of family size from ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' also applied here, although he acknowledged that \"on the other side is the belief of many that the fetus, once formed, is a member of the human family and that mere personal inconvenience cannot justify the fetus' destruction.\" He also challenged the majority opinion with a series of hypothetical questions asking whether \"health\" might also include the stigma of having an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] child, anxiety from the pregnancy being unwanted, the physical work of raising a child, the financial drain from the added expense of another child, and far off health risks that may never actually materialize in a similar fashion to how risks were warded off with [[Prophylactic surgery|prophylactic]] appendectomy.<ref>[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/402/62.html United States v.

She began by bringing up constitutional reasons why the Court should overturn Texas's abortion law, but Justice Stewart asked questions directed towards the jurisdiction question instead. Weddington replied that she saw no problem with jurisdiction and continued to talk about a [[Constitutional right#United States|constitutional right]] to abortion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ofbhHLhOhH8C&dq=%22In+one+case%2C+Sarah+Weddington%2C+a+poised%22&pg=PT265 The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court] by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong, New York: Simon and Schuster, page 1979, page 265</ref> Overall, she spent between 20 and 30 minutes discussing jurisdiction and procedure instead of constitutional issues.<ref name=forsythe98/>\n\nIn his opening argument in defense of the abortion restrictions, attorney Jay Floyd made what was later described as the \"worst joke in legal history\".<ref name=\"salon\">Sant, Geoffrey. \"[http://www.salon.com/2013/07/26/8_horrible_courtroom_jokes_and_their_ensuing_legal_calamity 8 horrible courtroom jokes and their ensuing legal calamities]\", ''Salon.com'' (July 27, 2013): \"The title of Worst Joke in Legal History belongs to one of history's highest-profile cases.

He knew that Burger could not write it himself because the abortion was too controversial, and his opinions might get rejected by the majority. He also understood why the other justices could not be assigned to write the opinions: Douglas was too liberal for the public to accept his word. Likewise, he might split the Court's vote by writing something radical. In addition, the quality of his opinions had suffered recently. Brennan was the only Catholic on the Court, and he would have to face Catholic political groups which were against abortion. If Marshall wrote the opinions, the ruling would be perceived as being directed towards African Americans, and he would have to face the displeasure of African American political groups.

The Court first surveyed abortion's status throughout the history of [[Roman law]] and the English and early American common law.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} It also reviewed the developments of medical procedures and technology used in abortions.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}\n\nAfter its historical surveys, the Court introduced the concept of a constitutional \"[[Right to privacy#United States|right to privacy]]\" that it said had been intimated in earlier decisions such as ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' and ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'', which involved parental control over [[Parenting|childrearing]], and ''Griswold v. Connecticut'', which involved the use of contraception.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} Then, \"with virtually no further explanation of the privacy value\",{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}} the Court ruled that regardless of exactly which provisions were involved, the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of liberty covered a right to privacy that protected a pregnant woman's decision whether to abort a pregnancy.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}\n{{Blockquote\n|text=This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether to terminate her pregnancy.\n|source=''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 153.<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}.</ref>\n}}\nThe Court reasoned that outlawing abortions would infringe a pregnant woman's right to privacy for several reasons: having unwanted children \"may force upon the woman a distressful life and future\"; it may bring imminent psychological harm; caring for the child may tax the mother's physical and mental health; and because there may be \"distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child\".<ref>{{harvp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}, quoting ''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 153.</ref> But at the same time, the Court rejected the notion that this right to privacy was absolute.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} It held instead that women's abortion right must be balanced against other [[government interest]]s, such as protecting [[maternal health]] and protecting the life of the fetus.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} The Court held that these government interests were sufficiently compelling to permit states to impose some limitations on pregnant women's right to choose to have an abortion.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}\n{{Blockquote\n|text=A State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life.

Justice Potter Stewart wrote a concurring opinion in which he said that even though the Constitution makes no mention of the right to choose to have an abortion without interference, he thought the Court's decision was a permissible interpretation of the doctrine of [[substantive due process]], which says that the [[Due Process Clause]]{{'s}} protection of liberty extends beyond simple procedures and protects certain fundamental rights.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 888, note 47}}{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}} Justice William O. Douglas's concurring opinion described his view that although the Court was correct to find that the right to choose to have an abortion was a fundamental right, he thought it would have been better to derive it from the Ninth Amendment{{mdash}}which states that the fact that a [[Unenumerated rights|right is not specifically enumerated]] in the Constitution shall not be construed to mean that American people do not possess it{{mdash}}rather than through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 888, note 47}}{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}}\n\nChief Justice Warren Burger wrote a concurrence in which he wrote that he thought it would be permissible to allow a state to require two physicians to certify an abortion before it could be performed.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 888, note 47}} His concurrence also states:<ref name=burgerconcurring>[http://landmarkcases.c-span.org/pdf/Roe_Burger_Concurrence.pdf ''Roe v.

If there is a relationship between abortion and crime, there are several possibilities that could explain how abortion lowers crime. One possibility is that crime is disproportionally committed by young males, and legalizing abortion reduced the number of young males. Another possibility is that children born in the post-legalization era are less likely to commit crimes. If this is the case, it might be explained in two ways. One way is that the sort of women who have abortions are not representative of pregnant women as a whole; rather they are the sort who are most likely to give birth to children who grow up to be criminals. In this way, abortion serves to [[Eugenics in the United States#Efforts to shape American families|shape American family structure]].<ref name=donohue2001/> Studies linking demographics to crime have found that children born to American teenagers, unmarried mothers, and mothers with lower incomes are more likely to engage in criminal activity as adolescents.<ref>[https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w6034/w6034.pdf Abortion Legalization and Child Living Circumstances: Who is the \"Marginal Child?\"] by Jonathan Gruber, Phillip Levine, and Douglas Staiger, National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper 6034, May 1997</ref> Abortion rates are higher for these demographics. A second possible way to explain it is that women use abortion to prevent births until they are most able to provide a stable home environment. Factors involved in stability include the age, education, income, of the mother, her use of drugs and alcohol, the presence of a father, and wanted as opposed to unwanted pregnancies.<ref name=donohue2001>{{cite journal |last1=Donohue |first1=J.J.

The hypothesis is that people in favor of abortion rights would not parent as many children when abortion is legal, and since children tend to have similar views to their parents eventually voters would not support abortion rights.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202354/http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110006557 Babies Having (Fewer) Babies] by James Taranto, wsj.com ''OpinionJournal'', Dow Jones & Company, April 14, 2005</ref> Critics have argued that Donohue and Levitt's methodologies are flawed and that no statistically significant relationship between abortion and later crime rates can be proven.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Handbook on Crime and Deviance |date=2019 |others=Marvin D.
