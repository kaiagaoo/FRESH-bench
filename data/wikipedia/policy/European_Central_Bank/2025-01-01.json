First, because the ECB's legal framework normally forbids the purchase of sovereign bonds in the primary market (Article 123. TFEU),<ref>Bagus, ''The Tragedy of the Euro'', 2010, p.75.</ref> An over-interpretation of this limitation, inhibited the ECB from implementing [[quantitative easing]] like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England did as soon as 2008, which played an important role in stabilizing markets.\n\nSecondly, a decision by the ECB made in 2005 introduced a minimum credit rating (BBB-) for all Eurozone sovereign bonds to be eligible as collateral to the ECB's open market operations. This meant that if a private rating agencies were to downgrade a sovereign bond below that threshold, many banks would suddenly become illiquid because they would lose access to ECB refinancing operations. According to former member of the governing council of the ECB [[Athanasios Orphanides]], this change in the ECB's collateral framework \"planted the seed\" of the euro crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/how-ecb-planted-seeds-euro-area-crisis|title=Monetary policy and fiscal discipline: How the ECB planted the seeds of the euro area crisis|last=Orphanides|first=Athanasios|date=9 March 2018|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nFaced with those regulatory constraints, the ECB led by Jean-Claude Trichet in 2010 was reluctant to intervene to calm down financial markets.

Extraordinarily, the decision was taken by the Governing Council during a teleconference call only three days after the ECB's usual meeting of 6 May (when Trichet still denied the possibility of purchasing sovereign bonds). The ECB justified this decision by the necessity to \"address severe tensions in financial markets.\" The decision also coincided with the EU leaders decision of 10 May to establish the European Financial Stabilisation mechanism, which would serve as a crisis fighting fund to safeguard the euro area from future sovereign debt crisis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/30048|title=Mixed support for ECB bond purchases|access-date=22 September 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAlthough at first limited to the debt of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the bulk of the ECB's bond buying eventually consisted of Spanish and Italian debt.<ref>{{cite news |first1=John |last1=McManus |first2=Dan |last2=O'Brien |title=Market rout as Berlin rejects call for more EU action |journal=Irish Times |date=5 August 2011 }}</ref> These purchases were intended to dampen international speculation against stressed countries, and thus avoid a contagion of the Greek crisis towards other Eurozone countries.

Although it had deferred the cash cost of recapitalising the failing Anglo Irish Bank by nationalising it and issuing it with a \"promissory note\" (an IOU), the Government also faced a large deficit on its non-banking activities, and it therefore turned to the official sector for a loan to bridge the shortfall until its finances were credibly back on a sustainable footing. Meanwhile, Anglo used the promissory note as collateral for its emergency loan (ELA) from the Central Bank.

During this period, inflation expectations remained relatively stable, leading to the misinterpretations by the European Central Bank and other monetary authorities regarding the inflationary trend's nature.<ref name=\":1\" /> Both the FED and the ECB argued that the rise in inflation was only temporary and was the sole result of post-pandemic supply disruptions on a few selected goods and services (food and energy). The FED and the ECB then maintained their expansionary monetary policy, keeping interest rates low.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSome critics have also emerged saying that it was complicated for independent central banks, including the ECB, to accurately assess during a synchronized policy rate hike the potential spillovers of cross-countries monetary policy on the inflation. This might lead to excessive monetary tightening (higher interest rates) in unusual circumstances.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nConcerns have also been raised about the European Central Bank's effectiveness in addressing the recent surge in energy prices.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal |last1=Ider |first1=G\u00f6khan |last2=Kriwoluzky |first2=Alexander |last3=Kurcz |first3=Frederik |last4=Schumann |first4=Ben |date=2023 |title=The Energy-Price Channel of (European) Monetary Policy |url=https://ideas.repec.org//p/zbw/vfsc23/277710.html |journal=VFS Annual Conference 2023 (Regensburg): Growth and the \"sociale Frage\" |language=en}}</ref> Some experts suggest that the eurozone should be viewed as a small open economy, implying that changes in its demand may not significantly impact global prices. Moreover, they argue that monetary policy might have minimal influence on the global demand for energy. This is because household demand for essentials like heating and transportation is believed to be relatively insensitive to price changes.<ref name=\":4\" /> Additionally, while a stronger euro could theoretically lead to lower import prices, it's uncertain whether these savings would be effectively passed on to consumers.\n\nHowever, recent studies contradict these views by highlighting the significant role of energy prices in the transmission of monetary policy within the eurozone. An increase in the ECB's policy rates tends to appreciate the euro against the dollar. This appreciation can lead to higher local energy costs but may also reduce demand, potentially lowering global energy prices. These studies support the ECB's decision to follow the Federal Reserve's lead in raising policy rates, which appears to have been a strategic move to curb imported inflation and address the spike in energy prices.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Effects of the monetary tightening ====\nThe implementing a of tighter monetary policy has emerged as the eurozone solution to fight the latest inflationary pressure.

Studies have shown that as interest rates rise, the price on the world market does not really change. However, the Euro becomes more attractive to investors, leading to its appreciation against other currencies. This change benefits households paying for gas in Euros, as it translates into lower prices for dollar-traded oil.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOn the other hand, the increase in interest rates, while helping to suppress prices, also places strains on the manufacturing sector and the labor market. The aftermath of this shock sees tighter financing conditions and a dip in demand, resulting in a slight uptick in unemployment rates, going beyond 0.1 percentage points. Although the study shows that manufacturing sector quickly rebounds, returning to its pre-shock state within about three months, the impact on unemployment rates lingers for a longer period.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==Mandate and inflation target==\n[[File:Euro bank notes centered (50s, 100s, 500s), maestro card, master card \u2014 Mattes 2006-05-12.jpg|thumb|[[Euro banknotes]]]]\nThe ECB has one primary objective \u2013 price stability \u2013 subject to which it may pursue secondary objectives.\n\n=== Primary mandate ===\nThe primary objective of the European Central Bank, set out in Article 127(1) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], is to maintain [[price stability]] within the [[Eurozone]].<ref>[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title VIII: Economic and Monetary Policy#CHAPTER 2: MONETARY POLICY|wikisource consolidation]]</ref> However the EU Treaties do not specify exactly how the ECB should pursue this objective.

When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again. An increase in the number of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy. A decrease has the contrary effect. The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Bank's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability. In layman's terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.{{efn|The process is similar, though on a grand scale, to an individual who every month charges $10,000 on his or her credit card, pays it off every month, but also withdraws (and pays off) an additional $10,000 each succeeding month for transaction purposes. Such a person is operating \"net borrowed\" on a continual basis, and even though the borrowing from the credit card is short-term, the effect is a stable increase in the money supply. If the person borrows less, less money circulates in the economy. As people borrow more, the money supply increases. An individual's ability to borrow from his or her credit card company is determined by the credit card company: it reflects the company's overall judgment of its ability to lend to all borrowers, and also its appraisal of the financial condition of that one particular borrower. The ability of member banks to borrow from the central bank is fundamentally similar.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} }}\n\nTo qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities.

The NCBs of the non-participating countries have had to pay 7% of their respective subscriptions to the ECB's capital as a contribution to the operational costs of the ECB. As a result, the ECB was endowed with an initial capital of just under \u20ac4&nbsp;billion.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The capital is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.<ref>Article 28.4 of the ESCB Statute</ref> The NCBs are the sole subscribers to and holders of the capital of the ECB.\n\nToday, ECB capital is about \u20ac11 billion, which is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders.<ref name=\"capital\"/> The NCBs' shares in this capital are calculated using a capital key which reflects the respective member's share in the total population and gross domestic product of the EU. The ECB adjusts the shares every five years and whenever the number of contributing NCBs changes. The adjustment is made on the basis of data provided by the European Commission.\n\nAll national central banks (NCBs) that own a share of the ECB capital stock as of 1 February 2020 are listed below.

[[doi:10.1016/j.jpolmod.2011.08.017|DOI]].</ref>) In addition to monetary policy decisions, the ECB has the right to issue legally binding regulations, within its competence and if the conditions laid down in Union law are fulfilled, it can sanction non-compliant actors if they violate legal requirements laid down in directly applicable Union regulations. The ECB's own legal personality also allows the ECB to enter into international legal agreements independently from other EU institutions, and be the party of legal proceedings. Finally, the ECB can organise its internal structure as it sees fit. \n* '''Personal independence:''' the mandate of ECB board members is purposefully very long (8 years) and Governors of national central banks have a minimum renewable term of office of five years.<ref name=\"Independence\" /> In addition, ECB board members are vastly immune from judicial proceedings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp4.pdf?581a2ecf674a6554f5af698f5bf54019|title=PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK|date=2007|website=European Central Bank}}</ref> Indeed, removals from the office can only be decided by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] (CJEU), under the request of the ECB's Governing Council or the executive board (i.e. the ECB itself). Such a decision is only possible in the event of incapacity or serious misconduct. National governors of the Eurosystem's national central banks can be dismissed under national law (with a possibility to appeal) in case they can no longer fulfil their functions or are guilty of serious misconduct.\n* '''Financial independence''': the ECB is the only body within the EU whose statute guarantees budgetary independence through its own resources and income. The ECB uses its own profits generated by its monetary policy operations and cannot be technically insolvent. The ECB's financial independence reinforces its political independence. Because the ECB does not require external financing and symmetrically is prohibited from [[Monetary financing|direct monetary financing]] of public institutions, this shields it from potential pressure from public authorities.\n*'''Political independence''': The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the member states may not seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the NCBs in the performance of their tasks. Symmetrically, EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECB's independence. It is the latter which is the subject of much debate.\n\n===Democratic accountability===\nIn return to its high degree of independence and discretion, the ECB is accountable to the [[European Parliament]] (and to a lesser extent to the European Court of Auditors, the European Ombudsman and the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU)). Although the accountability mechanisms are not enshrined in EU law, several practices were established following a resolution of the European Parliament adopted in 1998,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Report on democratic accountability in the third phase of European Monetary Union \u2013 Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy \u2013 A4-0110/1998|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A4-1998-0110&language=EN|access-date=8 October 2018|website=europarl.europa.eu|language=en}}</ref> which were informally agreed by the ECB, and incorporated into the Parliament's rule of procedure.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The evolution of the ECB's accountability practices during the crisis|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/articles/2018/html/ecb.ebart201805_01.en.html|access-date=8 October 2018|website=European Central Bank|date=9 August 2018|language=en}}</ref> In 2023, the European Parliament and the ECB made these accountability arrangements were made more formal by signing an exchange of letter.<ref>[https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/Exchange_of_Letters_ECB_European_Parliament_central_banking230605~87aa8ed4a3.en.pdf Exchange of letters between the ECB and the European Parliament]  (5 June 2023)</ref>\n\nThe accountability framework involves five main mechanisms:<ref>{{Cite web|title=Accountability|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html|access-date=2020-11-25|website=European Central Bank|date=20 August 2020|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* '''Annual report:''' the ECB is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Council]] .<ref name=\"ECB Acc\">{{cite web|title=Accountability|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html|access-date=15 October 2007|publisher=European Central Bank}}</ref> The report is presented to the European parliament at the occasion of a specific hearing with the ECB's vice-president at the ECON committee.\n* '''Annual parliamentary resolution:''' in return, the European Parliament evaluates the past activities to the ECB via its own annual resolution on the European Central Bank's report (which is essentially a non-legally-binding list of resolutions).

This agreement sets broader powers to the European Parliament than the established practice on the monetary policy side of the ECB's activities. For example, under the agreement, the Parliament can veto the appointment of the chair and vice-chair of the ECB's supervisory board and may approve removals if requested by the ECB.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament and the European Central Bank on the practical modalities of the exercise of democratic accountability and oversight over the exercise of the tasks conferred on the ECB within the framework of the Single Supervisory Mechanism|date=30 November 2013 |url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/celex_32013q113001_en_txt.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Transparency ===\nIn addition to its independence, the ECB is subject to limited transparency obligations in contrast to EU Institutions standards and other major central banks. Indeed, as pointed out by [[Transparency International]], \"The Treaties establish transparency and openness as principles of the EU and its institutions. They do, however, grant the ECB a partial exemption from these principles. According to Art. 15(3) TFEU, the ECB is bound by the EU's transparency principles \"only when exercising [its] administrative tasks\" (the exemption \u2013 which leaves the term \"administrative tasks\" undefined \u2013 equally applies to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to the European Investment Bank).<ref>Braun, Benjamin, and Leo Hoffmann-Axthelm. \u2018[https://transparency.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TI-EU_ECB_Report_DIGITAL.pdf Two Sides of the Same Coin: Independence and Accountability of the European Central Bank]\u2019. Transparency International, March 2017.</ref>\n\nIn practice, there are several concrete examples where the ECB is less transparent than other institutions:\n* '''Voting secrecy:''' while other central banks publish the voting record of its decision makers, the ECB's Governing Council decisions are made in full discretion. Since 2014, the ECB has published \"accounts\" of its monetary policy meetings,<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2014/html/pr140703_1.en.html |title=ECB to adjust schedule of meetings and to publish regular accounts of monetary policy discussions in 2015 |website=European Central Bank |date=3 July 2014 |language=en |access-date=5 November 2017}}</ref> but those remain rather vague and do not include individual votes.\n* '''Access to documents:''' The obligation for EU bodies to make documents freely accessible after a 30-year embargo applies to the ECB. However, under the ECB's Rules of Procedure, the Governing Council may decide to keep individual documents classified beyond the 30 years.<!-- Art. 23.3 Rules of Procedure. See also CJEU in joined cases T-3/00 and T-337/04 -->\n* '''Disclosure of securities:''' The ECB is less transparent than the Fed when it comes to disclosing the list of securities being held in its balance sheet under monetary policy operations such as QE.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bruegel.org/2017/11/the-eurosystem-too-opaque-and-costly/|title=The Eurosystem \u2013 Too opaque and costly? |website=bruegel.org|language=en-US|access-date=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\n{{Main|Seat of the European Central Bank}}\n[[File:Frankfurt EZB.Nordwest-2.20141228.jpg|thumb|The new ECB headquarters, which opened in 2014]]\n\nThe bank is based in [[Ostend (Frankfurt am Main)|Ostend]] (East End), [[Frankfurt am Main]].

The German government agreed to go ahead if certain crucial guarantees were respected, such as a European Central Bank independent of national governments and shielded from political pressure along the lines of the German central bank. The French government, for its part, feared that this independence would mean that politicians would no longer have any room for manoeuvre in the process. A compromise was then reached by establishing a regular dialogue between the ECB and the Council of Finance Ministers of the euro area, the Eurogroup.\n\n==== Arguments in favour of independence ====\nThere is strong consensus among economists on the value of central bank independence from politics.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Vaitilingam|first=Romesh|date=May 13, 2019|title=Fed Appointments|url=https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/fed-appointments/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211204174401/https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/fed-appointments/|archive-date=December 4, 2021|access-date=December 4, 2021|website=IGM Forum}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Rampell|first=Catherine|date=July 15, 2009|title=Petition for Fed Independence|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/petition-for-fed-independence/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210128110926/https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/petition-for-fed-independence/|archive-date=January 28, 2021|access-date=4 December 2021|website=NY Times}}</ref> The rationale behind are both empirical and theoretical. On the theoretical side, it's believed that time inconsistency suggests the existence of political business cycles where elected officials might take advantage of policy surprises to secure reelection. The politician up to the election will therefore be incentivized to introduce expansionary monetary policies, reducing unemployment in the short run. These effects will be most likely temporary. By contrast, in the long run, it will increase inflation, with unemployment returning to the natural rate negating the positive effect. Furthermore, the credibility of the central bank will deteriorate, making it more difficult to answer the market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mishkin|first=Frederic|date=September 2006|title=Monetary Policy Strategy: How Did We Get Here?|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w12515.pdf|journal=|language=en|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=w12515|doi=10.3386/w12515|s2cid=154595734}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=European Central Bank.|url=https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2866/908675|title=The case for central bank independence.|date=2020|publisher=Publications Office|location=LU|doi=10.2866/908675|isbn=9789289944243}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Barro|first1=Robert|last2=Gordon|first2=David|date=February 1983|title=Rules, Discretion and Reputation in a Model of Monetary Policy|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w1079.pdf|journal=|language=en|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=w1079|doi=10.3386/w1079}}</ref> Additionally, empirical work has been done that defined and measured central bank independence (CBI), looking at the relationship of CBI with inflation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cukierman|first1=Alex|last2=Web|first2=Steven B.|last3=Neyapti|first3=Bilin|date=1992|title=Measuring the Independence of Central Banks and Its Effect on Policy Outcomes|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/wber/6.3.353|journal=The World Bank Economic Review|volume=6|issue=3|pages=353\u2013398|doi=10.1093/wber/6.3.353|issn=0258-6770}}</ref>\n\n==== The arguments against too much independence ====\n\n===== An independence that would be the source of a democratic deficit. =====\nAccording to Christopher Adolph, the alleged neutrality of central bankers is only a legal fa\u00e7ade and not an indisputable fact.<ref name=\"Adolph, Christopher, 1976\u20132013\">{{Cite book|last=Adolph |first=Christopher |title=Bankers, bureaucrats, and central bank politics : the myth of neutrality|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-61681-2|location=New York|oclc=844940155}}</ref>\n\n'''The crisis: an opportunity to impose its will and extend its powers''':\n\n\u2013 ''Its participation in the [[European troika|troika]]'': Thanks to its three factors which explain its independence, the ECB took advantage of this crisis to implement, through its participation in the troika, the famous structural reforms in the Member States aimed at making, more flexible the various markets, particularly the labour market, which are still considered too rigid under the [[ordoliberal concept]].<ref name=\"Delaume 2015 75\">{{Cite journal|last=Delaume|first=Coralie|date=2015|title=O\u00f9 va la Banque centrale europ\u00e9enne ?: De la technique \u00e0 la politique, sans la d\u00e9mocratie|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-le-debat-2015-5-page-75.htm|journal=Le D\u00e9bat|language=fr|volume=187|issue=5|pages=75|doi=10.3917/deba.187.0075|issn=0246-2346}}</ref>\n\n- ''[[Macro-prudential supervision]]'' : At the same time, taking advantage of the reform of the financial supervision system, the Frankfurt Bank has acquired new responsibilities, such as macro-prudential supervision, in other words, supervision of the provision of financial services.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fontan|first=Cl\u00e9ment|date=2010|title=Chantiers de recherche transfert d'id\u00e9e et r\u00e9sistances au changement : le cas de la banque centrale europ\u00e9enne apr\u00e8s la crise.: Questionnement scientifique et objectifs de la th\u00e8se|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-politique-europeenne-2010-1-page-225.htm|journal=Politique Europ\u00e9enne|language=fr|volume=30|issue=1|pages=225|doi=10.3917/poeu.030.0225|issn=1623-6297|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n-''Take liberties with its mandate to save the Euro'' : Paradoxically, the crisis undermined the ECB's ordoliberal discourse \"because some of its instruments, which it had to implement, deviated significantly from its principles.

Indeed, the Euro is an overvalued currency on the world markets against the dollar and the euro zone is at risk of deflation. In addition, Member States find themselves heavily indebted, partly due to the rescue of their national banks. The ECB, as the guardian of the stability of the euro zone, is deciding to gradually buy back more than EUR 1 100 billion Member States' public debt. In this way, money is injected back into the economy, the euro depreciates significantly, prices rise, the risk of deflation is removed, and Member States reduce their debts. However, the ECB has just given itself the right to direct the exchange rate policy of the euro zone without this being granted by the Treaties or with the approval of European leaders, and without public opinion or the public arena being aware of this.<ref name=\"Delaume 2015 75\"/>\n\nIn conclusion, for those in favour of a framework for ECB independence, there is a clear concentration of powers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2024}}\n\n===== The arguments in favour of a counter power =====\nIn the aftermath of the euro area crisis, several proposals for a countervailing power were put forward, to deal with criticisms of a democratic deficit. For the German economist German Issing (2001) the ECB as a democratic responsibility and should be more transparent. According to him, this transparency could bring several advantages as the improvement of efficiency and credibility by giving the public adequate information. Others think that the ECB should have a closer relationship with the European Parliament which could play a major role in the evaluation of the democratic responsibility of the ECB.<ref name=\"Barbier-Gauchard, Am\u00e9lie 1978-....\">{{Cite book|last=Barbier-Gauchard, Am\u00e9lie (1978\u2013....).|title=La gouvernance \u00e9conomique de la zone euro : r\u00e9alit\u00e9s et perspectives|date=15 May 2018|others=Sidiropoulos, Mo\u00efse., Varoudakis, Aristom\u00e8ne (1958\u2013....)., De Grauwe, Paul (1946\u2013....).|isbn=978-2-8073-2010-9|location=Louvain-la-Neuve|oclc=1041143371}}</ref> The development of new institutions or the creation of a minister is another solution proposed:\n\n'''Towards democratic institutions ?'''\n\nThe absence of democratic institutions such as a Parliament or a real government is a regular criticism of the ECB in its management of the euro area, and many proposals have been made in this respect, particularly after the economic crisis, which would have shown the need to improve the governance of the euro area. For Mo\u00efse Sidiropoulos, a professor in economy: \"The crisis in the euro zone came as no surprise, because the euro remains an unfinished currency, a stateless currency with a fragile political legitimacy\".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019|title=L'euro reste une monnaie inachev\u00e9e|url=http://www.recherche.unistra.fr/index.php?id=30096|website=Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg}}</ref>\n\nFrench economist [[Thomas Piketty]] wrote on his blog in 2017 that it was essential to equip the eurozone with democratic institutions. An economic government could for example enable it to have a common budget, common taxes and borrowing and investment capacities. Such a government would then make the euro area more democratic and transparent by avoiding the opacity of a council such as the Eurogroup.\n\nNevertheless, according to him \"there is no point in talking about a government of the eurozone if we do not say to which democratic body this government will be accountable\", a real parliament of the eurozone to which a finance minister would be accountable seems to be the real priority for the economist, who also denounces the lack of action in this area.<ref>{{Cite news|last=PIKETTY|first=Thomas|date=1 February 2017|title=Pour un gouvernement enfin d\u00e9mocratique de la zone euro|work=Le Monde|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/piketty/2017/02/01/pour-un-vrai-gouvernement-de-la-zone-euro/|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of a sub-committee within the current European Parliament was also mentioned, in the model of the Eurogroup, which is currently an under-formation of the ECOFIN Committee. This would require a simple amendment to the rules of procedure and would avoid a competitive situation between two separate parliamentary assemblies. The former President of the European Commission had, moreover, stated on this subject that he had \"no sympathy for the idea of a specific Eurozone Parliament\".<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 2014|title=R\u00c9FORMER LA \" GOUVERNANCE \" EUROP\u00c9ENNE POUR UNE F\u00c9D\u00c9RATION D'\u00c9TATS NATIONS PLUS L\u00c9GITIME ET PLUS EFFICACE|url=https://institutdelors.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reformergouvernanceue-bertoncini-vitorino-ne-ijd-sept14.pdf|website=Institut Jacques Delors}}</ref>\n\n==== Debates on the role of central bank reserves in monetary policy ====\nIn \"Towards monetary policies that do not subsidise banks\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=de Grauwe |first1=Paul |last2=Ji |first2=Yuemei |date=2023-06-13 |title=Towards monetary policies that do not subsidise banks |url=https://www.ceps.eu/ceps-publications/towards-monetary-policies-that-do-not-subsidise-banks/ |journal=CEPS }}</ref> published in July 2023 and co-authored with Yuemei Ji, [[Paul De Grauwe|Paul de Grauwe]] criticizes the prevailing role of central bank reserves in monetary policy. Holding the John Paulson Chair in European Political Economy at the [[London School of Economics]], de Grauwe presented his views on this matter in a lecture at the [[Deutsche Bundesbank|Bundesbank]] in September 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |last=de Grauwe |first=Paul |date=2023-09-04 |title=The role of central bank reserves in monetary policy: Bundesbank Invited Speakers Series |url=https://www.bundesbank.de/en/service/dates/the-role-of-central-bank-reserves-in-monetary-policy-913968 |access-date=2023-11-26 |website=Deutsche Bundesbank}}</ref>\n\nDe Grauwe states that major central banks are currently operating in a regime of abundance of bank reserves. This abundance, he argues, is a consequence of massive government bond-buying programs and a fundamental change in the operating procedures of these central banks. Since late 2021, in response to rising interest rates aimed at combating inflation, central banks have adopted a procedure of increasing interest rates by raising the remuneration on bank reserves. This approach has resulted in substantial interest payments to commercial banks. Due to past Quantitative Easing, bank reserves are now massive, leading to huge transfers of profits. Paul de Grauwe highlights the magnitude of these interest payments, comparing them to significant public expenditures:\u00a0 the interests received by [[commercial bank]]s to the yearly spending of the EU (\u20ac165 billion) to the interest payments of the ECB during the same period (\u20ac152 billion).\n\nDe Grauwe argues that these transfers lack economic rationale. Despite seigniorage gains traditionally returning to the government, he observes that central banks are transferring more than the total seigniorage gains to private banks, resulting in significant losses and effectively constituting a subsidy to banks at the expense of taxpayers.\n\nFurthermore, the author raises concerns about moral hazard, noting that the provision of free interest hedging for banks by central banks may create ethical issues, as public authorities offer free insurance to private agents.\n\nQuestioning the economic rationale for these practices, de Grauwe states that the remuneration of bank reserves is not totally necessary for conducting monetary policy and that the regime of reserve abundance is a result of the oversupply of reserves created by central banks through the buying of large amounts of [[government bond]]s. Now, central banks cannot raise the interest rate without remunerating bank reserves, the equilibrium of demand (commercial blanks) and supply (central banks) being under the 0% rate. De Grauwe also states that the reserve abundance regime has altered the view of economists on the role of central banks : money base created by the central bank is now viewed as part of the public debt since central banks must pay a rate of remuneration on bank reserves. According to de Grauwe, this view is not inevitable and he suggests alternative operating procedures to address these issues : a gradual return to a regime of scarce reserves through Quantitative Tightening, raising minimum reserve requirements without paying interest on bank reserves, and implementing a two-tier system of reserve requirements to control the market rate while reducing transfers to commercial banks.{{Citation needed|date=July 2024}}\n\nPolicymakers at the European Central Bank are split on the economic outlook, with some worried about a looming recession and others focused on inflation pressures. This disagreement is likely to impact future decisions on interest rate cuts, with one side advocating for faster cuts due to economic concerns, while the other prefers a cautious approach to ensure inflation remains under control.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Koranyi|first1= Balazs| date=1 September 2024 |title=ECB policymakers at odds over downturn's impact, sources say |newspaper=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ecb-policymakers-odds-over-downturns-impact-sources-say-2024-09-02/ |access-date=2 September 2024}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Banks|Europe}}\n* [[European Banking Authority]]\n* [[European Systemic Risk Board]]\n* [[Open market operation]]\n* [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]]\n* [[Capital Markets Union]]\n* [[European banking union]]\n* [[List of central banks]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|European Central Bank}}\n{{wikisource|Consolidated protocols, annexes and declarations attached to the treaties of the European Union#Protocol (no 4) on the statute of the European system of central banks and of the European central bank|Protocol on the statute of the ESCB and ECB}}\n*{{Official website}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{ECB board}}\n{{Central banks of the European Union}}\n{{Central banks}}\n{{Economies of EU Dependencies}}\n{{Euro topics}}\n{{European Union topics}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|European Union|Economy}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:European Central Bank| ]]\n[[Category:1998 establishments in the European Union]]\n[[Category:Banks established in 1998]]\n[[Category:Eurosystem]]\n[[Category:Eurozone]]\n[[Category:Institutions of the European Union]]\n[[Category:Banks based in Frankfurt]]\n[[Category:European System of Central Banks]]\n[[Category:European Banking Supervision|+]]"}
