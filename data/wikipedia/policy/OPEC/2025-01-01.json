Coordination among oil-producing states within OPEC made it easier for them to nationalize oil production and structure oil prices in their favor without incurring punishment by Western governments and firms. Prior to the creation of OPEC, individual oil-producing states were punished for taking steps to alter the governing arrangements of oil production within their borders. States were coerced militarily (e.g. in 1953, the US-UK-sponsored a [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup against Mohammad Mosaddegh]] after he nationalized Iran's oil production) or economically (e.g. the Seven Sisters slowed down oil production in one non-compliant state and ramped up oil production elsewhere) when acted contrary to the interests of the Seven Sisters and their governments.{{sfn|Colgan|2021|loc=The Rise of OPEC, pp. 59\u201393}}\n\nThe organisational logic that underpins OPEC is that it is in the collective interest of its members to limit the world oil supply in order to reap higher prices.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the main problem within OPEC is that it is individually rational for members to cheat on commitments and produce as much oil as possible.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPolitical scientist Jeff Colgan has argued that OPEC has since the 1980s largely failed to achieve its goals (limits on world oil supply, stabilized prices, and raising of long-term average revenues).<ref name=\":1\" /> He finds that members have cheated on 96% of their commitments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The analysis spans over the period 1982\u20132009.{{sfn|Colgan|2021|pp=107\u2013109}} To the extent that when member states comply with their commitments, it is because the commitments reflect what they would do even if OPEC did not exist. One large reason for the frequent cheating is that OPEC does not punish members for non-compliance with commitments.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn June 2020, all countries participating in the OPEC+ framework collectively agreed to the introduction of a Compensation Mechanism aimed at ensuring full conformity with and adherence to the agreed-upon oil production cuts.

Oil [[Energy conservation|conservation]] efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] cars and appliances, year-round [[daylight saving time]], reduced usage of [[HVAC|heating and air-conditioning]], better [[building insulation]], increased support of [[mass transit]], and greater emphasis on [[coal]], [[natural gas]], [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]] and other [[alternative energy]] sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption rose only 11 percent during 1980\u20132014, while [[real GDP]] rose 150 percent.

Indonesia announced another \"temporary suspension\" of its OPEC membership rather than accepting the organization's requested 5-percent production-cut.
