It comprises two separate projects, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2. Both pipelines each comprise two pipes, NS1 A and B as well as NS2 A and B, for a total of 4 physical pipes. Both pipelines start in Russia and land in [[Lubmin]], Germany. They are majority owned (51 per cent) by Russia, along with German, Dutch and French stakeholders. They were financed by a consortium of companies from [[Russia]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Austria]] and the [[Netherlands]]. It was the first pipeline that bypassed [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]] to deliver Russian natural gas directly to West Europe. The project was opposed from the start by the [[United States]],<ref>[[Stephen Kinzer]]: [https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/10/28/when-pipeline-politics-go-boom/ When pipeline politics go boom], [[Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft]], 28 October 2022</ref><ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/attacke-gegen-ex-kanzler-us-abgeordneter-wirft-schroeder-politische-prostitution-vor-1.746819 ''Attacke gegen Ex-Kanzler \u2013 US-Abgeordneter wirft Schr\u00f6der \u201epolitische Prostitution\u201c vor.''], ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 12 June 2007.</ref> who imposed sanctions on companies that were involved in the project.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-imposes-further-sanctions-connection-with-nord-stream-2-gas-pipeline-2021-11-22/ U.S. imposes further sanctions in connection with Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline]</ref> The U.S. sanctions were critized heavily by European leaders as \"a serious interference in the internal affairs of Germany and Europe and their sovereignty\".<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-russia-nord-stream-germany-idAFS8N28N08D Germany \"firmly rejects\" U.S. sanctions on Nord Stream 2 firms]</ref>\n\n* [[Nord Stream 1]] (NS1) runs from [[Vyborg]], in northwestern Russia near Finland, and entered service in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2011-11-08 |title=Controversial Project Launched : Merkel and Medvedev Open Baltic Gas Pipeline |language=en |work=Der Spiegel |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/controversial-project-launched-merkel-and-medvedev-open-baltic-gas-pipeline-a-796611.html |access-date=2022-10-13 |issn=2195-1349}}</ref> It is operated by [[Nord Stream AG]].\n* [[Nord Stream 2]] (NS2) runs from Ust-Luga in northwestern Russia near Estonia.
