It comprises two separate projects, Nord Stream 1 and 2. Both pipelines each comprise two pipes, NS1 A and B as well as NS2 A and B, for a total of 4 physical pipes. Both pipelines land in [[Lubmin]], Germany.\n\n* [[Nord Stream 1]] (NS1) runs from [[Vyborg]], in northwestern Russia near [[Finland]], and entered service in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2011-11-08 |title=Controversial Project Launched : Merkel and Medvedev Open Baltic Gas Pipeline |language=en |work=Der Spiegel |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/controversial-project-launched-merkel-and-medvedev-open-baltic-gas-pipeline-a-796611.html |access-date=2022-10-13 |issn=2195-1349}}</ref> It is operated by [[Nord Stream AG]].\n* [[Nord Stream 2]] (NS2) runs from Ust-Luga in northwestern Russia near [[Estonia]]. The pipeline was built in order to increase gas exports towards Europe, aiming to double annual capacity.

None of the four pipes are currently operational, bringing the Nord Stream project to an effective standstill. In reaction to this, U.S. Secretary of State [[Antony Blinken|Antony J. Blinken]] stated that \"... it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy and thus to take away from Vladimir Putin the weaponization of energy as a means of advancing his imperial designs. ...\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{set index}}"}
