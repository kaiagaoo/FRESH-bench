Prior to the Restoration, Japan's feudal fiefs all issued their own money, ''[[Scrip of Edo period Japan|hansatsu]]'', in an array of incompatible denominations, but the ''New Currency Act'' of Meiji 4 (1871) did away with these and established the [[yen]] as the new decimal currency, which had parity with the Mexican silver dollar.<ref>Nussbaum, \"Banks\", {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|page=69}}.</ref> The former [[Han (Japan)|han]] (fiefs) became [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]]s and their mints became private chartered banks which, however, initially retained the right to print money. For a time both the central government and these so-called \"national\" banks issued money. A period of unanticipated consequences was ended when the Bank of Japan was founded in Meiji 15 (10 October 1882), under the Bank of Japan Act 1882 (27 June 1882), after a Belgian model. It has since been partly privately owned (its stock is traded over the counter, hence the stock number).<ref>[[Willy Vande Walle|Vande Walle, Willy]] ''et al.''

The tool was instrumental in the creation of the 'bubble economy' of the 1980s. It was implemented by the Bank of Japan's then \"Business Department\" (\u55b6\u696d\u5c40), which was headed during the \"bubble years\" from 1986 to 1989 by [[Toshihiko Fukui]] (who became deputy governor in the 1990s and governor in 2003).\n\nA major 1997 revision of the Bank of Japan Act was designed to give it greater independence;<ref>Cargill, [https://books.google.com/books?id=f3s47HWB8g8C&dq=bank+of+Japan&pg=PA197 p. 19.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428043744/https://books.google.com/books?id=f3s47HWB8g8C&pg=PA197&dq=bank+of+Japan&client=firefox-a#PPA19,M1 |date=28 April 2016 }}</ref> however, the Bank of Japan has been criticized for already possessing excessive independence and lacking in accountability before this law was promulgated.<ref>Horiuchi, Akiyoshi (1993), \"Japan\" in Chapter 3, \"Monetary policies\" in Haruhiro Fukui, Peter H.

However, they still kept the fixed exchange rate as 360Yen/$ for two weeks, so it caused excess liquidity. In addition, they persisted with the Smithsonian rate (308Yen/$), and continued monetary easing until 1973. This created a greater-than-10% inflation rate at that time. In order to control stagflation, they raised the official bank rate from 7% to 9% and skyrocketing prices gradually ended in 1978.\n\nIn 1979, when the energy crisis happened, the BOJ raised the official bank rate rapidly. The BOJ succeeded in a quick economic recovery. After overcoming the crisis, they reduced the official bank rate. In 1980, the BOJ reduced the official bank rate from 9.0% to 8.25% in August, to 7.25% in November, and to 5.5% in December in 1981. \"[[Reaganomics]]\" was in vogue in America and USD became strong. However, Japan tried to implement fiscal reconstruction at that time, so they did not stop their financial regulation.\n\nIn 1985, the agreement of G5 nations, known as the Plaza Accord, USD slipped down and Yen/USD changed from 240yen/$ to 200yen/$ at the end of 1985. Even in 1986, USD continued to fall and reached 160yen/$. In order to escape deflation, the BOJ cut the official bank rate from 5% to 4.5% in January, to 4.0% in March, to 3.5% in April, 3.0% in November. At the same time, the government tried to raise demand in Japan in 1985, and did economy policy in 1986. However, the market was confused about the rapid fall of USD. After the Louvre Accord in February 1987, the BOJ decreased the official bank rate from 3% to 2.5%, but JPY/USD was 140yen/$ at that time and reached 125yen/$ in the end of 1987. The BOJ kept the official bank rate at 2.5% until May in 1989. Financial and fiscal regulation led to a widespread over-valuing of real estate and investments and Japan faced a bubble at that time.\n\n[[File:Japan bonds.webp|thumb|300px|{{center|Japan bonds}} [[Inverted yield curve]] in 1990 <br> [[Zero interest-rate policy]] started in 1995\n{{legend-line|#00A2FF solid 3px|30 year}}\n{{legend-line|#61D836 solid 3px|20 year}}\n{{legend-line|#929292 solid 3px|10 year}}\n{{legend-line|#F8BA00 solid 3px|5 year}}\n{{legend-line|#FF2600 solid 3px|2 year}}\n{{legend-line|#73FDEA solid 3px|1 year}}\n]]\n\nAfter 1990, the stock market and real asset market fell. At that time BOJ regulated markets until 1991 in order to end the bubble.\n\nIn January 1995, [[Great Hanshin earthquake|a terrible earthquake]] happened and Japanese yen became stronger and stronger. JPY/USD reached 80yen/$, so the BOJ reduced the office bank rate to 0.5% and the yen recovered. The period of deflation started at that time.\n\nIn 1999, the BOJ started zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP), but they ended it despite government opposition when the IT bubble happened in 2000. However, Japan's economic bubble burst in 2001 and the BOJ adopted the balance of current account as the main operating target for the adjustment of the financial market in March 2001 (quantitative relaxation policy), shifting from the zero-interest-rate policy. From 2003 to 2004, Japanese government did exchange intervention operation in huge amount, and the economy recovered a lot. In March 2006, BOJ finished quantitative easing, and finished the zero-interest-rate policy in June and raised to 0.25%.\n\nIn 2008, the financial crisis happened, and Japanese economy turned bad again. BOJ reduced the uncollateralized call rate to 0.3% and adopted the supplemental balance of current account policy. In December 2008, BOJ reduced uncollateralized call rate again to 0.1% and they started to buy Japanese Government Bond (JGB) along with commercial paper (CP) and corporate bonds.\n<ref>Kuroda Haruhiko(2013)\u8ca1\u653f\u91d1\u878d\u653f\u7b56\u306e\u6210\u529f\u3068\u5931\u6557</ref>\n\n[[File:Japanese Bond Market.webp|thumb|300px|Japanese bond market <br> [[Negative interest on excess reserves|Negative interest rates]] started in 2014.\n{{legend-line|#FF42A1 solid 3px|40 year bond}}\n{{legend-line|#BC002D solid 3px|10 year bond}}\n{{legend-line|#61D836 solid 3px|5 year bond}}\n{{legend-line|#00A2FF solid 3px|1 year bond}}\n{{legend-line|#F27200 solid 3px|1 month bond}}\n]]\n\nIn 2013, the head of the BOJ (Kuroda) announced a new quantitative easing program (QE).
