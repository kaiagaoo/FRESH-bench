Casey]]'' overturned one part of a law regulating abortion, the provision mandating that married women first inform their husbands if they sought an abortion. Alito, the third judge on the panel, disagreed, arguing that he would have upheld the spousal notification requirement along with the rest of the law.\n\n;Federalism\n* A dissenting opinion in ''[[United States v. Rybar]]'', 103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 1996), arguing that a U.S. law banning private citizens from owning [[submachine gun]]s was similar to one struck down by the Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' and thus outside the authority of Congress under the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]].\n* A majority opinion in ''[[Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development]]'', 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]] against the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]]. States are free to maintain [[sovereign immunity]] under the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee's claims.\n\n;First Amendment\n* A majority opinion in ''[[Saxe v. State College Area School District]]'', 240 F.3d 200 (3d Cir. 2001), holding that a public school district's anti-harassment policy was unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore violated [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|First Amendment]] guarantees of [[free speech]].\n* A majority opinion in ''[[ACLU v. Schundler]]'', 168 F.3d 92 (3d Cir. 1999), holding that a government-sponsored holiday display consisting solely of religious symbols was impermissible, but that a mixed display including both secular and religious symbols was permissible if balanced in a generally secular context.\n* A dissenting opinion in ''[[C. H. v. Oliva]]'' (3d Cir. 2000), arguing that the removal and subsequent replacement in \"a less conspicuous spot\" of a kindergartener's religious themed poster was, at least potentially, a violation of his right to free expression.\n\n;Fourth and Eighth Amendments\n*A dissenting opinion in ''[[Doe v. Groody]]'', arguing that [[qualified immunity]] should have protected police officers from a finding of having violated constitutional rights when they [[strip-search]]ed a mother and her ten-year-old daughter while carrying out a [[search warrant]] that authorized the search of a residence.\n*A unanimous opinion in ''Chadwick v. Janecka'' (3d Cir. 2002), holding that there was \"no federal constitutional bar\" to the \"indefinite confinement\" of a [[H. Beatty Chadwick|man imprisoned]] for [[contempt of court|civil contempt]] because he would not pay his $2.5&nbsp;million debt to his wife.\n\n;Civil rights\n*A unanimous opinion in ''[[Williams v. Price]]'', 343 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2003), granting a writ of [[habeas corpus]] to a black state prisoner after state courts had refused to consider the testimony of a witness who stated that a juror had uttered derogatory remarks about blacks during an encounter in the courthouse after the conclusion of the trial.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 9, 2003 |url=http://vls.law.villanova.edu/locator/3d/Sept2003/002305p.pdf |title=Ronald A.

Philadelphia Electric Company'', 34 F.3d 188 (3rd Cir. 1994), arguing that a lower court did not abuse its discretion in excluding certain evidence of past conduct that defendant had created a hostile and racist work environment.\n* A majority opinion in ''Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh'', 120 F.3d 1286 (3rd Cir. 1997), rejecting a female police officer's [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]]-based sexual harassment and retaliation claims against the city and certain police officials and rejecting her [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII]]-based retaliation claim against the city, but allowing her Title VII-based [[sexual harassment]] claim against the city.\n\n==U.S. Supreme Court==\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2023}}\n===Nomination and confirmation===\n{{Main|Samuel Alito Supreme Court nomination}}\n\n[[File:With President George W.

passed the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], which led to a lawsuit in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''. The Court had previously ruled in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' that a state's ban on [[partial birth abortion]] was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after ''Stenberg'', with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in ''Roe'') and O'Connor (a supporter of ''Roe'') respectively. Further, the ban at issue in ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the ''Stenberg'' case.\n\nOn April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy said that the challenged statute was consistent with the Court's prior decisions in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', and ''Stenberg v. Carhart''.\n\nAlito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[David Souter]], [[Stephen Breyer]], and [[John Paul Stevens]] dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.\n\nOn May 2, 2022, ''[[Politico]]'' published a [[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization#Leaked draft opinion|leak of a first draft of a majority opinion]] by Alito that circulated among the justices in February 2022 for the upcoming decision in ''[[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization]]''. The opinion would overturn ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', and would likely either severely restrict access to abortion or make it completely illegal in states with [[trigger law]]s.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gerstein |first1=Josh |last2=Ward |first2=Alexander |date=May 2, 2022 |title=Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion rights, draft opinion shows |work=[[Politico]] |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473 |access-date=May 2, 2022}}</ref> On June 24, 2022, the ruling was handed down. It was mostly identical to the leaked draft, with the addition of replies to the dissenting and concurring opinions. Alito wrote that \"''Roe'' was egregiously wrong from the start\", that its reasoning was \"exceptionally weak\" and that, \"far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue\", it had \"enflamed debate and deepened division\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Liptak |first=Adam  |author-link=Adam Liptak |date=June 24, 2022 |title=In 6-to-3 Ruling, Supreme Court Ends Nearly 50 Years of Abortion Rights |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/us/roe-wade-overturned-supreme-court.html |access-date=June 24, 2022}}</ref> In July 2022, Alito gave his first public comments on the ruling in a keynote address for [[Notre Dame Law School]]'s Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome.
