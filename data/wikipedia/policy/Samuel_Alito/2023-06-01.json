Alito, the third judge on the panel, disagreed, arguing that he would have upheld the spousal notification requirement along with the rest of the law.\n\n;Federalism\n* A dissenting opinion in ''[[United States v. Rybar]]'', 103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 1996), arguing that a U.S. law banning private citizens from owning [[submachine gun]]s was similar to one struck down by the Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' and thus outside the authority of Congress under the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]].\n* A majority opinion in ''[[Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development]]'', 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]] against the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]]. States are free to maintain [[sovereign immunity]] under the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee's claims.\n\n;First Amendment\n* A majority opinion in ''[[Saxe v. State College Area School District]]'', 240 F.3d 200 (3d Cir. 2001), holding that a public school district's anti-harassment policy was unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore violated [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|First Amendment]] guarantees of [[free speech]].\n* A majority opinion in ''[[ACLU v. Schundler]]'', 168 F.3d 92 (3d Cir. 1999), holding that a government-sponsored holiday display consisting solely of religious symbols was impermissible, but that a mixed display including both secular and religious symbols was permissible if balanced in a generally secular context.\n* A dissenting opinion in ''[[C. H. v. Oliva]]'' (3d Cir. 2000), arguing that the removal and subsequent replacement in \"a less conspicuous spot\" of a kindergartener's religious themed poster was, at least potentially, a violation of his right to free expression.\n\n;Fourth and Eighth Amendments\n*A dissenting opinion in ''[[Doe v. Groody]]'', arguing that [[qualified immunity]] should have protected police officers from a finding of having violated constitutional rights when they [[strip-search]]ed a mother and her ten-year-old daughter while carrying out a [[search warrant]] that authorized the search of a residence.\n*A unanimous opinion in ''Chadwick v. Janecka'' (3d Cir. 2002), holding that there was \"no federal constitutional bar\" to the \"indefinite confinement\" of a [[H. Beatty Chadwick|man imprisoned]] for [[contempt of court|civil contempt]] because he would not pay his $2.5&nbsp;million debt to his wife.\n\n;Civil rights\n*A majority opinion in ''[[Williams v. Price]]'', 343 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2003), granting a writ of [[habeas corpus]] to a black state prisoner after state courts had refused to consider the testimony of a witness who stated that a juror had uttered derogatory remarks about blacks during an encounter in the courthouse after the conclusion of the trial.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 9, 2003 |url=http://vls.law.villanova.edu/locator/3d/Sept2003/002305p.pdf |title=Ronald A.

City of Pittsburgh'', 120 F.3d 1286 (3rd Cir. 1997), rejecting a female police officer's [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]]-based sexual harassment and retaliation claims against the city and certain police officials and rejecting her [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII]]-based retaliation claim against the city, but allowing her Title VII-based [[sexual harassment]] claim against the city.\n\n==Nomination to U.S. Supreme Court==\n{{Main|Samuel Alito Supreme Court nomination}}\n[[File:With President George W.

These decisions were released with an 8-member Court; none were 4\u20134, so Alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated. Only three of these cases&nbsp; \u2013 ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'', ''[[Hudson v. Michigan]]'', and ''[[Kansas v. Marsh]]''&nbsp; \u2013 were reargued since a tie needed to be broken.\n\n==U.S. Supreme Court==\nAlito delivered his first written opinion on May 1, 2006, in ''[[Holmes v. South Carolina]]'', a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime.  From the beginning of the [[Rehnquist Court]] to the nomination of Justice [[Elena Kagan]], new justices have been given unanimous opinions to write as their first opinion, often done as a courtesy \"breaking in\" of new justices, so that every justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt. Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in ''[[Zedner v. United States]]'', ''[[Woodford v. Ngo]]'', and ''[[Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy]]''.\n\nIn his first term, Alito voted fairly conservatively. For example, in the three reargued cases (''Garcetti v. Ceballos'', ''Hudson v. Michigan'' and ''Kansas v. Marsh''), Alito created a 5\u20134 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices&nbsp;\u2013 [[John G. Roberts|Chief Justice Roberts]] and Justices [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]], [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]], and [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]]. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on ''[[Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/04-10566.pdf |title=Sanchez-Llamas v.

CNN.</ref>\n\nMoreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed \"Scalito\", Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case cited above and various other cases of the 2005 term. A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation, Scalia was the only member of the Court in ''[[Zedner v. United States]]'' not to join a section of Alito's opinion that discussed the legislative history of the statute in question. In two higher-profile cases, involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]] (''[[LULAC v. Perry]]'' and ''[[Randall v. Sorrell]]''), Alito adopted narrow positions, declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the Court. According to a [[SCOTUSblog]] analysis of 2005 term decisions, Alito and Scalia concurred in the result of 86% of decisions (in which both participated), and concurred in full in 75%.<ref>[http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/June28VotingStats.pdf SCOTUS Blog] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927135744/http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/June28VotingStats.pdf |date=September 27, 2006 }}  (By scotusblog.com's reckoning, this is less agreement than between Scalia and Kennedy, O'Connor and Souter, or Stevens and Ginsburg.) On the recent abortion ruling, Alito simply joined Anthony Kennedy's opinion rather than join Scalia in Thomas's stronger assertion.</ref> Alito also differs from Scalia in applying originalism flexibly to arrive at conservative outcomes \"with plodding consistency\", rather than following it so strictly as to occasionally produce outcomes unfavorable to conservatives.<ref name=\"talbot alito\"/>\n\n[[File:Swearing-in Ceremony for Secretary of Defense Mark Esper (48374478966).jpg|thumb|left|Alito swearing in [[Mark Esper]] as the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] in 2019.]]\n\nAlito's majority opinion in the 2008 worker protection case ''[[Gomez-Perez v.

Speaking to the [[Federalist Society]], Alito criticized what he called the \"loss of individual liberties\", saying, \"We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020\", and called the pandemic \"a Constitutional stress test\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barnes |first1=Robert |title=Justice Alito says pandemic has resulted in 'unimaginable' restrictions on individual liberty |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/12/samuel-alito-federalist-society-speech/ |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=19 November 2020 |archive-date=November 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119071544/https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/12/samuel-alito-federalist-society-speech/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', since the 2020 appointment of Justice [[Amy Coney Barrett]], Alito has become \"the embodiment of a conservative majority that is ambitious and extreme\", overruling progressive precedents from the 1960s and '70s that were previously out of conservatives' reach.<ref name=\"talbot alito\">{{cite news |last1=Talbot |first1=Margaret |title=Justice Alito's Crusade Against a Secular America Isn't Over |date=August 28, 2022 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/09/05/justice-alitos-crusade-against-a-secular-america-isnt-over |access-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-date=February 9, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230209215031/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/09/05/justice-alitos-crusade-against-a-secular-america-isnt-over }}</ref> \n\n=== Abortion ===\nIn 2003, Congress passed the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], which led to a lawsuit in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''. The Court had previously ruled in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' that a state's ban on [[partial birth abortion]] was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after ''Stenberg'', with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in ''Roe'') and O'Connor (a supporter of ''Roe'') respectively. Further, the ban at issue in ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the ''Stenberg'' case.\n\nOn April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy said that the challenged statute was consistent with the Court's prior decisions in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', and ''Stenberg v. Carhart''.\n\nAlito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ginsburg, Souter, Breyer, and Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.\n\nOn May 2, 2022, ''[[Politico]]'' published a [[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization#Leaked draft opinion|leak of a first draft of a majority opinion]] by Alito that circulated among the justices in February 2022 for the upcoming decision in ''[[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization]]''. The opinion would overturn ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Planned Parenthood v.
