However, the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act as well as associated regulations. Much of this regulatory-enforcement work is not directly related to food or drugs but involves other factors like regulating [[lasers]], [[cellular phones]], and [[condoms]]. In addition, the FDA takes control of diseases in the contexts varying from household pets to [[sperm donation|human sperm donated]] for use in [[assisted reproduction]].\n\nThe FDA is led by the [[commissioner of Food and Drugs|commissioner of food and drugs]], appointed by the president with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

Its employees, known as Consumer Safety Officers, or more commonly known simply as investigators, inspect production, warehousing facilities, investigate complaints, illnesses, or outbreaks, and review documentation in the case of medical devices, drugs, biological products, and other items where it may be difficult to conduct a physical examination or take a physical sample of the product. The Office of Regulatory Affairs is divided into five regions, which are further divided into 20 districts. The districts are based roughly on the geographic divisions of the [[United States federal court system|Federal court system]]. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. ORA also includes the Agency's network of regulatory laboratories, which analyze any physical samples taken. Though samples are usually food-related, some laboratories are equipped to analyze drugs, cosmetics, and radiation-emitting devices.\n\n==== Office of Criminal Investigations ====\n[[File:US Food and Drug Administration Office 20180930.jpg|thumb|Jamaica, Queens, New York Regional Office - USFDA]]\nThe [[Office of Criminal Investigations]] was established in 1991 to investigate criminal cases. To do so, OCI employs approximately 200 Special Agents nationwide who, unlike ORA Investigators, are armed, have badges, and do not focus on technical aspects of the regulated industries. Rather, OCI agents pursue and develop cases when individuals and companies commit criminal actions, such as fraudulent claims or knowingly and willfully shipping known adulterated goods in interstate commerce. In many cases, OCI pursues cases involving violations of [[Title 18 of the United States Code]] (e.g., conspiracy, false statements, wire fraud, mail fraud), in addition to prohibited acts as defined in Chapter III of the FD&C Act. OCI Special Agents often come from other criminal investigations backgrounds, and frequently work closely with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]], and even [[Interpol]]. OCI receives cases from a variety of sources\u2014including ORA, local agencies, and the FBI, and works with ORA Investigators to help develop the technical and science-based aspects of a case.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Office of Regulatory Affairs |date=October 7, 2021 |title=About OCI |url=https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/criminal-investigations/about-oci |journal=FDA |language=en |access-date=January 14, 2023 |archive-date=January 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230114025654/https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/criminal-investigations/about-oci |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==== Other locations ====\nThe FDA has a number of field offices across the United States, in addition to international locations in China, India, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=May 21, 2020 |title=Buildings and Facilities |url=https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/jobs-and-training-fda/buildings-and-facilities |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200421020851/https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/jobs-and-training-fda/buildings-and-facilities |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=May 20, 2020 | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Scope and funding==\nAs of 2021, the FDA had responsibility for overseeing $2.7 trillion in food, medical, and tobacco products.<ref name=2021faqs/> Some 54% of its budget derives from the federal government, and 46% is covered by industry user fees for FDA services.<ref name=\"2021faqs\">{{Cite web |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |date=November 26, 2021 |title=Fact Sheet: FDA at a Glance |url=https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-basics/fact-sheet-fda-glance |access-date=February 21, 2022 |archive-date=February 24, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220224041029/https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-basics/fact-sheet-fda-glance |url-status=live }}</ref> For example, [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical firms]] pay fees to expedite drug reviews.<ref name=2021faqs/>\n\nAccording to Forbes, pharmaceutical firms provide 75% of the FDA's drug review budget<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = LaMattina J |date=June 28, 2018 |title=The Biopharmaceutical Industry Provides 75% Of The FDA's Drug Review Budget.

Pursuant to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] and accompanying legislation, the FDA has authority to oversee the quality of substances sold as food in the United States, and to monitor claims made in the [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]] of both the composition and the health benefits of foods.\n\nThe FDA subdivides substances that it regulates as food into various categories\u2014including foods, [[food additive]]s, added substances (human-made substances that are not intentionally introduced into food, but nevertheless end up in it), and [[dietary supplements]].

A change to over-the-counter (OTC) status is a separate process, and the drug must be approved through an NDA first. A drug that is approved is said to be \"safe and effective when used as directed\".\n\nVery rare, limited exceptions to this multi-step process involving animal testing and controlled clinical trials can be granted out of compassionate use protocols. This was the case during the 2015 Ebola epidemic with the use, by prescription and authorization, of [[ZMapp]] and other experimental treatments, and for new drugs that can be used to treat debilitating and/or very rare conditions for which no existing remedies or drugs are satisfactory, or where there has not been an advance in a long period of time. The studies are progressively longer, gradually adding more individuals as they progress from stage I to stage III, normally over a period of years, and normally involve drug companies, the government and its laboratories, and often medical schools and hospitals and clinics. However, any exceptions to the aforementioned process are subject to strict review and scrutiny and conditions, and are only given if a substantial amount of research and at least some preliminary human testing has shown that they are believed to be somewhat safe and possibly effective.

When its application to manufacture generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. Mylan eventually filed suit against two former FDA employees and four drug-manufacturing companies, charging that corruption within the federal agency resulted in [[racketeering]] and in violations of [[antitrust law]]. \"The order in which new generic drugs were approved was set by the FDA employees even before drug manufacturers submitted applications\" and, according to Mylan, this illegal procedure was followed to give preferential treatment to certain companies.

Cosmetic products are not, in general, subject to premarket approval by the FDA unless they make \"structure or function claims\" that make them into drugs (see [[Cosmeceutical]]). However, all color additives must be specifically FDA approved before manufacturers can include them in cosmetic products sold in the U.S. The FDA regulates cosmetics labeling, and cosmetics that have not been safety tested must bear a warning to that effect.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-labeling-regulations/summary-cosmetics-labeling-requirements |title=Summary of Cosmetics Labeling Requirements |date=August 2, 2018 |website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |access-date=December 4, 2019 |archive-date=December 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213121829/https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-labeling-regulations/summary-cosmetics-labeling-requirements |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the industry advocacy group, the [[American Council on Science and Health]], though the cosmetic industry is primarily responsible for its own product safety, the FDA can intervene when necessary to protect the public. In general, though, cosmetics do not require pre-market approval or testing. The ACSH says that companies must place a warning note on their products if they have not been tested, and that experts in cosmetic ingredient review also play a role in monitoring safety through influence on ingredients, but they lack legal authority. According to the ACSH, it has reviewed about 1,200 ingredients and has suggested that several hundred be restricted\u2014but there is no standard or systemic method for reviewing chemicals for safety, or a clear definition of what 'safety' even means so that all chemicals get tested on the same basis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross G | title = A perspective on the safety of cosmetic products: a position paper of the American Council on Science and Health | journal = International Journal of Toxicology | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 269\u2013277 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16815815 | doi = 10.1080/10915810600746049 | s2cid = 21904805 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nHowever, on December 29, 2022, President Biden signed the '2023 Consolidated Budget Act', which includes the 'Cosmetics Regulatory Modernization Act of 2022 (MoCRA)', which is a stricter regulation that is different from the previous regulations.

The committee was composed of 16 experts, including leaders in clinical medicine medical research, economics, [[biostatistics]], law, public policy, public health, and the allied health professions, as well as current and former executives from the [[drug company|pharmaceutical]], hospital, and [[health insurance]] industries. The authors found major deficiencies in the current FDA system for ensuring the safety of drugs on the American market.

Children react differently to the drugs because of many reasons, including size, weight, etc. There were several reasons that few medical trials were done with children. For many drugs, children represented such a small proportion of the potential market, that drug manufacturers did not see such testing as cost-effective.<ref name = \"PedReg\"/>\n\nAlso, the belief that children are ethically restricted in their ability to give [[informed consent]] brought increased governmental and institutional hurdles to approval of these clinical trials, and greater concerns about [[legal liability]]. Thus, for decades, most medicines prescribed to children in the U.S. were done so in a non-FDA-approved, \"off-label\" manner, with dosages \"extrapolated\" from adult data through body weight and body-surface-area calculations.<ref name = \"PedReg\"/>\n\nIn an initial FDA attempt to address this issue they produced the 1994 FDA Final Rule on Pediatric Labeling and Extrapolation, which allowed manufacturers to add pediatric labeling information, but required drugs that had not been tested for pediatric safety and efficacy to bear a disclaimer to that effect. However, this rule failed to motivate many drug companies to conduct additional pediatric drug trials. In 1997, the FDA proposed a rule to require pediatric drug trials from the sponsors of [[New Drug Application]]s. However, this new rule was successfully preempted in federal court as exceeding the FDA's statutory authority.<ref name=\"PedReg\">{{Cite journal |author=Politis P |year=2005 |title=Transition From the Carrot to the Stick: The Evolution of Pharmaceutical Regulations Concerning Pediatric Drug Testing |journal=Widener Law Review |volume=12 |page=271}}</ref>\n\nWhile this debate was unfolding, Congress used the [[Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act|Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997]] to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The [[Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act|Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2007]] reauthorized these provisions and allowed the FDA to request [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, Congress codified the FDA's authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a \"last resort\" if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate.<ref name=\"PedReg\"/>\n\n===Priority review voucher (PRV)===\nThe [[priority review voucher]] is a provision of the [[Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007]], which awards a transferable \"priority review voucher\" to any company that obtains approval for a treatment for a [[neglected tropical diseases]].
