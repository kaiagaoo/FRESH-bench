It is then up to the Prosecutor acting ''ex proprio motu'' (\"of his own motion\" so to speak) to initiate an investigation under the requirements of [[:wikisource:Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court#Article 15: Prosecutor|Article 15 of the Rome Statute]]. The procedure is slightly different when referred by a State Party or the Security Council, in which cases the Prosecutor does not need authorization of the [[Pre-Trial Chamber]] to initiate the investigation. Where there is a reasonable basis to proceed, it is mandatory for the Prosecutor to initiate an investigation. The factors listed in Article 53 considered for reasonable basis include whether the case would be admissible, and whether there are substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice (the latter stipulates balancing against the gravity of the crime and the interests of the victims).{{Sfn|Schabas|2011}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Moffett |first=Luke |title=Justice for victims before the International Criminal Court |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group |isbn=978-0-415-72239-1 |series=Routledge research in international law |location=London New York}}</ref>\n\n== {{Anchor|Subject-matter jurisdiction}}Crimes for which individuals can be prosecuted ==\nThe Court's subject-matter jurisdiction means the crimes for which individuals can be prosecuted.

The Statute contains three jurisdictional requirements and three admissibility requirements. All criteria must be met for a case to proceed. The three jurisdictional requirements are (1) subject-matter jurisdiction (what acts constitute crimes), (2) territorial or personal jurisdiction (where the crimes were committed or who committed them), and (3) temporal jurisdiction (when the crimes were committed).\n\nFor an individual to be prosecuted by the Court either territorial jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction must exist. Therefore, an individual can only be prosecuted if he or she has either (1) committed a crime within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court or (2) committed a crime while being a national of a state that is within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court.\n\n=== Territorial jurisdiction ===\nThe [[territorial jurisdiction]] of the Court includes the territory, registered vessels, and registered aircraft of states which have either (1) become party to the Rome Statute or (2) accepted the Court's jurisdiction by filing a declaration with the Court.<ref name=\"RomeStatute\" />{{rp|article 12}}\n\nIn situations that are referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council, the territorial jurisdiction is defined by the Security Council, which may be more expansive than the Court's normal territorial jurisdiction.<ref name=\"RomeStatute\" />{{rp|article 13(b)}} For example, if the Security Council refers a situation that took place in the territory of a state that has both not become party to the Rome Statute and not lodged a declaration with the Court, the Court will still be able to prosecute crimes that occurred within that state.\n\n=== Personal jurisdiction ===\nThe personal jurisdiction of the Court extends to all natural persons who commit crimes, regardless of where they are located or where the crimes were committed, as long as those individuals are nationals of either (1) states that are party to the Rome Statute or (2) states that have accepted the Court's jurisdiction by filing a declaration with the Court.<ref name=\"RomeStatute\" />{{rp|article 12}} As with territorial jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction can be expanded by the Security Council if it refers a situation to the Court.<ref name=\"RomeStatute\" />{{rp|article 13(b)}}\n\n=== Temporal jurisdiction requirements ===\n{{Anchor|Temporal jurisdiction}}\nTemporal jurisdiction is the time period over which the Court can exercise its powers. No statute of limitations applies to any of the crimes defined in the Statute.<ref name=\"RomeStatute\" />{{rp|article 29}} This is not completely retroactive. Individuals can only be prosecuted for crimes that took place on or after 1 July 2002, which is the date that the Rome Statute entered into force.<ref name=\"RomeStatute\" />{{rp|article 11(1)}} If a state became party to the Statute, and therefore a member of the Court, after 1 July 2002, then the Court cannot exercise jurisdiction prior to the membership date for certain cases.<ref name=\"RomeStatute\" />{{rp|article 11(2)}} For example, if the Statute entered into force for a state on 1 January 2003, the Court could only exercise temporal jurisdiction over crimes that took place in that state or were committed by a national of that state on or after 1 January 2003.\n\n=== {{Anchor|Admissibility}}Admissibility requirements ===\nTo initiate an investigation, the Prosecutor must (1) have a \"reasonable basis to believe that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been or is being committed\", (2) the investigation would be consistent with the principle of complementarity, and (3) the investigation serves the interests of justice.<ref name=\"RomeStatute\" />{{rp|article 53(1)}}\n\n==== Complementarity ====\nThe principle of complementarity means the Court will only prosecute an individual if states are unwilling or unable to prosecute.<ref>{{Cite book |last=K\u00f6chler |first=Hans |title=Global justice or global revenge? international criminal justice at the crossroads ; philosophical reflections on the principles of the international legal order published on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the foundation of the International Progress Organization |date=2003 |publisher=Springer |others=International Progress Organization |isbn=978-3-211-00795-2 |series=Springer Science |location=Wien}}</ref> Therefore, if legitimate national investigations or proceedings into crimes have taken place or are ongoing, the Court will not initiate proceedings. This principle applies regardless of the outcome of national proceedings.<ref name=\"RomeStatute\" />{{rp|article 17(a)\u201317(c)}} Even if an investigation is closed without any criminal charges being filed or if an accused person is acquitted by a national court, the Court will not prosecute an individual for the crime in question so long as it is satisfied that the national proceedings were legitimate. The application of the complementarity principle has recently come under theoretical scrutiny.<ref>\n{{cite web

The Rome Statute grants certain powers to the [[United Nations Security Council]], which limit its functional independence. Article 13 allows the Security Council to refer to the Court situations that would not otherwise fall under the Court's jurisdiction (as it did in relation to the situations in Darfur and Libya, which the Court could not otherwise have prosecuted as neither Sudan nor Libya are state parties). Article 16 allows the Security Council to require the Court to defer from investigating a case for a period of twelve months.<ref name=\"RomeStatute\" />{{rp|article 16}} Such a deferral may be renewed indefinitely by the Security Council. This sort of an arrangement gives the ICC some of the advantages inhering in the organs of the United Nations such as using the enforcement powers of the Security Council, but it also creates a risk of being tainted with the political controversies of the Security Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanstudents.us/Eyes7/Public/Eyes%20on%20the%20ICC%207.1%20full%20volume%20preview.pdf |title=Abadir M.

Concurrently, the quest to find a way to punish international crimes shifted from being the exclusive responsibility of legal experts to being shared with [[international human rights law|international human rights]] activism.\n\nNGOs helped birth the ICC through advocacy and championing for the prosecution of perpetrators of crimes against humanity.

The CICC also claims organizations that are themselves federations, such as the [[International Federation of Human Rights Leagues]] (FIDH).\n\nCICC members subscribe to three principles that permit them to work under the umbrella of the CICC, so long as their objectives match them:\n*Promoting worldwide ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute of the ICC\n*Maintaining the integrity of the Rome Statute of the ICC, and\n*Ensuring the ICC will be as fair, effective and independent as possible<ref name=\"CICC\"/>\n\nThe NGOs that work under the CICC do not normally pursue agendas exclusive to the work of the Court, rather they may work for broader causes, such as general human rights issues, victims' rights, gender rights, rule of law, conflict mediation, and peace.<ref name=\"Schiff\"/><ref>{{Citation |last=Chappell |first=Louise |title=The Role of the ICC in Transitional Gender Justice: Capacity and Limitations |date=2012 |url=https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230348615_2 |work=Gender in Transitional Justice |pages=37\u201358 |editor-last=Buckley-Zistel |editor-first=Susanne |access-date=2023-12-02 |series=Governance and Limited Statehood Series |place=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |language=en |doi=10.1057/9780230348615_2 |isbn=978-0-230-34861-5 |editor2-last=Stanley |editor2-first=Ruth}}</ref> The CICC coordinates their efforts to improve the efficiency of NGOs' contributions to the Court and to pool their influence on major common issues. From the ICC side, it has been useful to have the CICC channel NGO contacts with the Court so that its officials do not have to interact individually with thousands of separate organizations.\n\nNGOs have been crucial to the evolution of the ICC, as they assisted in the creation of the normative climate that urged states to seriously consider the Court's formation. Their legal experts helped shape the Statute, while their lobbying efforts built support for it. They advocate Statute ratification globally and work at expert and political levels within member states for passage of necessary domestic legislation. NGOs are greatly represented at meetings for the [[#Assembly|Assembly of States Parties]], and they use the ASP meetings to press for decisions promoting their priorities.<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> Many of these NGOs have reasonable access to important officials at the ICC because of their involvement during the Statute process. They are engaged in monitoring, commenting upon, and assisting in the ICC's activities.\n\nThe ICC often depends on NGOs to interact with local populations. The Registry Public Information Office personnel and Victims Participation and Reparations Section officials hold seminars for local leaders, professionals and the media to spread the word about the Court.<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> These are the kinds of events that are often hosted or organized by local NGOs. Because there can be challenges with determining which of these NGOs are legitimate, CICC regional representatives often have the ability to help screen and identify trustworthy organizations.\n\nNGOs are also \"sources of criticism, exhortation and pressure upon\" the ICC.<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> The ICC heavily depends on NGOs for its operations. Although NGOs and states cannot directly impact the judicial nucleus of the organization, they can impart information on crimes, can help locate victims and witnesses, and can promote and organize victim participation. NGOs outwardly comment on the Court's operations, \"push for expansion of its activities especially in the new justice areas of outreach in conflict areas, in victims' participation and reparations, and in upholding due-process standards and defense 'equality of arms' and so implicitly set an agenda for the future evolution of the ICC.\"<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> The relatively uninterrupted progression of NGO involvement with the ICC may mean that NGOs have become repositories of more institutional historical knowledge about the ICC than its national representatives, and have greater expertise than some of the organization's employees themselves. While NGOs look to mold the ICC to satisfy the interests and priorities that they have worked for since the early 1990s, they unavoidably press against the limits imposed upon the ICC by the states that are members of the organization. NGOs can pursue their own mandates, irrespective of whether they are compatible with those of other NGOs, while the ICC must respond to the complexities of its own mandate as well as those of the states and NGOs.\n\nAnother issue has been that NGOs possess \"exaggerated senses of their ownership over the organization and, having been vital to and successful in promoting the Court, were not managing to redefine their roles to permit the Court its necessary independence.\"<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> Additionally, because there does exist such a gap between the large human rights organizations and the smaller peace-oriented organizations, it is difficult for ICC officials to manage and gratify all of their NGOs. \"ICC officials recognize that the NGOs pursue their own agendas, and that they will seek to pressure the ICC in the direction of their own priorities rather than necessarily understanding or being fully sympathetic to the myriad constraints and pressures under which the Court operates.\"<ref name=\"Schiff\"/> Both the ICC and the NGO community avoid criticizing each other publicly or vehemently, although NGOs have released advisory and cautionary messages regarding the ICC. They avoid taking stances that could potentially give the Court's adversaries, particularly the U.S., more motive to berate the organization.\n\n==Criticisms & opposition ==\n===African states===\nIn October 2016, after repeated claims that the court was biased against African states, [[Burundi]], [[South Africa]] and the [[Gambia]] announced their withdrawals from the Rome Statute.<ref name=\"WPGambiaWD\">\n{{cite news|title=Gambia is the latest African country deciding to pull out of International Criminal Court|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/gambia-latest-african-country-deciding-to-pull-out-of-international-criminal-court/2016/10/26/7f54d068-c4ca-440f-848f-e211ba29dc34_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|last1=Sieff|first1=Kevin|date=26 October 2016|access-date=26 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027060357/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/gambia-latest-african-country-deciding-to-pull-out-of-international-criminal-court/2016/10/26/7f54d068-c4ca-440f-848f-e211ba29dc34_story.html|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Following [[2016 Gambian presidential election|Gambia's presidential election]] later that year, which ended the long rule of [[Yahya Jammeh]], Gambia rescinded its withdrawal notification.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/world/africa/burundi-international-criminal-court.html |title= Burundi Quits International Criminal Court |newspaper= The New York Times |last= Moore |first= Jina |date= 27 October 2017 |access-date= 20 March 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171109124035/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/world/africa/burundi-international-criminal-court.html |archive-date= 9 November 2017 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}</ref> A decision by the [[High Court of South Africa]] in early 2017 ruled that the attempted withdrawal was unconstitutional, as it had not been agreed by Parliament, prompting the South African government to inform the UN that it was revoking its decision to withdraw.<ref>{{cite news |last=Onishi |first=Norimitsu |date=8 March 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/africa/south-africa-icc-withdrawal.html |title=South Africa Reverses Withdrawal From International Criminal Court |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028094648/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/africa/south-africa-icc-withdrawal.html |archivedate=28 October 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Gissel |first=Line Engbo |title=The International Criminal Court and peace processes in Africa: judicialising peace |date=2020 |publisher=Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group |isbn=978-0-367-59335-3 |edition=First issued in paperback |series=Routledge studies in peace, conflict and security in Africa |location=London New York}}</ref>\n\n===African accusations of Western imperialism===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2022}}\n[[File:William Samoei Ruto.jpg|thumb|upright|Kenyan politician [[William Ruto]] in February 2013]]\nThe ICC has been accused of bias and as being a tool of Western [[imperialism]], only punishing leaders from small, weak states while ignoring crimes committed by richer and more powerful states.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/icc_and_africa.html|title=ICC and Africa \u2013 International Criminal Court and African Sovereignty|access-date=5 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231227/http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/icc_and_africa.html|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=live|date=11 October 2012}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ozatp-africa-icc-20110130-idAFJOE70T01R20110130|title=African Union accuses ICC prosecutor of bias|date=30 January 2011|work=Reuters|access-date=12 August 2019}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5BcKncSktrUC&q=icc+criticism+africa&pg=PA58|title=The European Union's Africa Policies|access-date=5 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429191025/https://books.google.com/books?id=5BcKncSktrUC&pg=PA58&dq=icc+criticism+africa&hl=en&ei=QjHXTrv-Os2aOoOxpbkO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=icc%20criticism%20africa&f=false|archive-date=29 April 2016|url-status=live|isbn=9781409400981|last1=Sicurelli|first1=Daniela|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate Publishing }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37750978 |title= Is this the end for the International Criminal Court?
