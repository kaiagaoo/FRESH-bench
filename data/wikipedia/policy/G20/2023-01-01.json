Summit themes have varied from year to year. \nThe theme of the [[2006 G20 ministerial meeting]] was \"Building and Sustaining Prosperity\". The issues discussed included domestic reforms to achieve \"sustained growth\", global energy and resource commodity markets, reform of the World Bank and IMF, and the impact of demographic changes.\n\nIn 2007, South Africa hosted the secretariat with [[Trevor A. Manuel]], South African Minister of Finance as chairperson of the G20.\n \nIn 2008, [[Guido Mantega]], Brazil's Minister of Finance, was the G20 chairperson and proposed dialogue on competition in financial markets, [[clean energy]], economic development and fiscal elements of growth and development.\n\nOn 11 October 2008 after a meeting of G7 finance ministers, [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]] stated that the next meeting of the G20 would be important in finding solutions to the burgeoning [[Late-2000s recession|economic crisis of 2008]].\n\n==Summits==\nThe Summit of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, who prepare the leaders' summit and implement their decisions, was created as a response both to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] and to a growing recognition that key [[emerging power|emerging countries]] were not adequately included in the core of global economic discussion and governance. Additionally, G20 summits of [[head of state|heads of state]] or [[head of government|government]] were held.\n\nAfter the 2008 debut summit in Washington, DC, G20 leaders met twice a year: in [[London]] and [[Pittsburgh]] in 2009, and in [[Toronto]] and [[Seoul]] in 2010.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8072894.stm \"US to host next G20 world meeting\"].
