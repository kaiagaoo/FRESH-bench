This resulted in a rise in world food prices and the threat of famine in lower-income countries. To address the issue, discussions began in April, hosted by Turkey (which [[Montreaux Convention|controls]] the [[Turkish straits|maritime routes from the Black Sea]]) and supported by the UN. The resulting agreement was signed in [[Istanbul]] on 22 July 2022, valid for a period of 120 days. The July agreement created procedures to safely export grain from certain ports to attempt to address the [[2022 food crises|2022 food crisis]]. A joint coordination and inspection center was set up in Turkey, with the UN serving as [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]].\n\nThe original agreement was set to expire on 19 November 2022.  Russia suspended its participation in the agreement for several days due to a drone attack on Russian naval ships elsewhere in the Black Sea, but rejoined following mediation.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news |date=2022-11-02 |title=Russia returns to Black Sea grain deal in sudden U-turn |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-resume-participation-black-sea-grain-deal-defence-ministry-2022-11-02/ |url-status=live |access-date=2022-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221102111743/https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-resume-participation-black-sea-grain-deal-defence-ministry-2022-11-02/ |archive-date=2022-11-02}}</ref> On 17 November 2022, the UN and Ukraine announced that the agreement had been extended for a further 120 days.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=November 17, 2022 |title=Ukraine, UN Announce Grain Deal Extension |url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/11/17/ukraine-un-announce-grain-deal-extension-a79404 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221118024548/https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/11/17/ukraine-un-announce-4-month-grain-deal-extension-a79404 |archive-date=November 18, 2022 |access-date=November 17, 2022 |website=[[The Moscow Times]]}}</ref> In March 2023, Turkey and the UN announced that they secured a second extension for at least another 60 days.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news |last=Erkoyun |first=Ezgi |date=5 March 2023 |title=Turkey says it is working to renew Black Sea grain deal |language=en |work=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/turkey-says-working-renew-black-sea-grain-deal-2023-03-05/ |access-date=2023-03-06}}</ref> In May 2023, the deal was once again extended for 60 days, expiring on 18 July.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news |last= |date=2023-05-17 |title=Russia confirms Black Sea grain deal renewed for two months |language=en |work=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-confirms-black-sea-grain-deal-renewed-two-months-2023-05-17/ |access-date=2023-05-17}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-May 2023, more than 950 voyages had successfully left Ukrainian ports carrying over 30 million tonnes of grain and other food products to more than 40 different countries.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|2022 food crises}}\nIn 2022, 47 million people were estimated to be suffering from severe hunger as a result of the world's soaring food costs partly due to the impact of the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]].
