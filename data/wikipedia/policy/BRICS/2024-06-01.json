They uphold drastically different political systems, from a vibrant democracy in Brazil to entrenched [[oligarchy]] in Russia, and their economies are little integrated and are different in size by orders of magnitude.

Furthermore, the BRICS project, argues Prashad, has no ability to challenge the primacy of the United States and [[NATO]].<ref>Prashad, Vijay 2014.

Coughlin also noted the contradictions within the organization, such as the [[Sino-Indian border dispute|border dispute between China and India]], and called for greater Western engagement with India as part of a new strategic alliance.<ref name=\"Coughlin\" />\n\nAccording to the [[Atlantic Council]]'s Thomas Hill in December 2023, the [[Dedollarisation|de-dollarization]] efforts within BRICS, particularly in North Africa, present a significant challenge to US interests. The inclusion of Egypt and the enthusiasm in Algiers and Tunis suggest that North African states may actively support BRICS's priority of de-dollarization. This poses a threat to the US, as a coordinated de-dollarization effort in the region could diminish American influence and impact existing trade agreements. The expansion of BRICS raises concerns for US policymakers, given the group's commitment to global de-dollarization, which aims to replace the dollar with the \"R5\" or \u201cthe renminbi, ruble, rupee, real, and rand\u201d, or with other multilateral [[Central bank digital currency|central bank digital currency (CBDC)]] as the new global currency. This shift could limit the US ability to run deficits and maintain low interest rates.
