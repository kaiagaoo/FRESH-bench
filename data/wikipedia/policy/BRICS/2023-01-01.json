They uphold drastically different political systems, from a vibrant democracy in Brazil to entrenched [[oligarchy]] in Russia, and their economies are little integrated and are different in size by orders of magnitude. Also, she states that the significant difference in GDP influences the reserves. China taking up over 41% of the contribution, which in turn leads to bigger political say within the association.<ref>\n{{cite web|last1=Coleman|first1=Isobel|title=Ten Questions for the New BRICS Bank|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/09/ten-questions-for-the-new-brics-bank/|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=24 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002050021/http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/09/ten-questions-for-the-new-brics-bank/|archive-date=2 October 2016|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nVijay Prashad, author and the [[Edward Said]] Chair at the [[American University of Beirut]], has raised the BRICS limitations as a political and economic \"locomotive of the South\" because they follow [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal policies]]. They have established neither new counter-balancing institutions nor come up with an alternative ideology. Furthermore, the BRICS project, argues Prashad, has no ability to challenge the primacy of the United States and [[NATO]].<ref>Prashad, Vijay 2014.
