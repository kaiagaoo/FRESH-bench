The ROC gained control over the latter after the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, but soon lost its control of mainland to the communists due to the [[Chinese Civil War]].

They uphold drastically different political systems, from a vibrant democracy in Brazil to entrenched [[oligarchy]] in Russia, and their economies are little integrated and are different in size by orders of magnitude. She also claimed that the significant difference in GDP influences the reserves: China accounts for over 41% of the contribution, which in turn leads to its bigger political say within the association.<ref>\n{{cite web|last1=Coleman|first1=Isobel|title=Ten Questions for the New BRICS Bank|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/09/ten-questions-for-the-new-brics-bank/|website=Foreign Policy|date=9 April 2013 |access-date=24 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002050021/http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/09/ten-questions-for-the-new-brics-bank/|archive-date=2 October 2016|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the Indian Marxist author [[Vijay Prashad]] raised the limitations of the BRICS as a political and economic \"locomotive of the South\" because they follow [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal policies]]. They have established neither new counter-balancing institutions nor come up with an alternative ideology. Furthermore, the BRICS project, argues Prashad, has no ability to challenge the primacy of the United States and [[NATO]].<ref>Prashad, Vijay 2014. ''The Poorer Nations: A Possible History of the Global South''. Verso. p10-11</ref>\n\nAfter the 2023 BRICS Summit, Con Coughlin, defence and foreign affairs editor at ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', claimed \"the challenge BRICS presents to the established world order seems destined to failure\" and accused the organization of being used by China as a vehicle for expanding its global influence. Coughlin also noted the contradictions within the organization, such as the [[Sino-Indian border dispute|border dispute between China and India]], and called for greater Western engagement with India as part of a new strategic alliance.<ref name=\"Coughlin\"/>\n\nA multi-year study at [[Tufts University]] found that the \"common portrayal of BRICS as a China-dominated group primarily pursuing anti-U.S. agendas is misplaced ... The BRICS countries connect around common development interests and a quest for a multipolar world order in which no single power dominates. Yet BRICS consolidation has turned the group into a potent negotiation force that now challenges Washington's geopolitical and economic goals\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Donnell |first1=Frank |last2=Papa |first2=Mihaela |last3=Han |first3=Zhen |title=As BRICS cooperation accelerates, is it time for the US to develop a BRICS policy? |url=https://theconversation.com/as-brics-cooperation-accelerates-is-it-time-for-the-us-to-develop-a-brics-policy-210021 |website=The Conversation |access-date=15 September 2023 |language=en |date=18 August 2023 |archive-date=27 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230927115736/https://theconversation.com/as-brics-cooperation-accelerates-is-it-time-for-the-us-to-develop-a-brics-policy-210021 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== BRICS Pro Tempore Presidency==\nThe group at each summit elects one of the heads of state of the component countries to serve as President Pro Tempore of the BRICS.
