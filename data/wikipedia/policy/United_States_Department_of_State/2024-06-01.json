C., 1865.png|left|thumb|Old State Department building in [[Washington, D.C.]], {{circa|1865}}]]\n\n=== Eighteenth century ===\nThe [[Articles of Confederation]] did not designate a separate executive branch of the government. Foreign affairs were delegated to the '''Committee of Secret Correspondence''' by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in 1775, based on the Committee of Correspondence that was used by the colony of Massachusetts to communicate with the other colonies. The Committee of Secret Correspondence was renamed the '''Committee of Foreign Affairs''' in 1777.{{Sfn|Short|1923|pp=46-47}} In 1781, the '''Department of Foreign Affairs''' was established as a permanent body to replace the Committee of Foreign Affairs, and the office of secretary of foreign affairs was established to lead the department.{{Sfn|Short|1923|pp=55-56}}\n\nThe [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], drafted September 1787 and [[ratified]] the following year, gave the [[President of the United States|president]] responsibility for conducting the federal government's affairs with foreign states. To that end, on July 21, 1789, the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]] approved legislation to reestablish the Department of Foreign Affairs under the new government, which President [[George Washington]] signed into law on July 27, making the department the first federal agency to be created under the new Constitution.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=001/llsl001.db&recNum=151 |title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875 |website=rs6.loc.gov |access-date=July 21, 2022 |archive-date=April 8, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408052445/http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=001/llsl001.db&recNum=151 |url-status=live }}</ref> This legislation remains the basic law of the Department of State.<ref>{{Cite web |title=22 U.S. Code \u00a7 2651 - Establishment of Department |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2651 |access-date=November 26, 2020 |website=Legal Information Institute |language=en |archive-date=December 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201201161140/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2651 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1789, [[Records Act|additional legislation]] changed the name of the agency to the '''Department of State''' and assigned it a variety of domestic duties, including managing the [[United States Mint]], keeping the [[Great Seal of the United States]], and administering the [[United States Census Bureau|census]].

However, the secretary of state still retains a few domestic responsibilities, such as serving as keeper of the Great Seal and being the officer to whom a president or vice president wishing to resign must deliver an [[Letter of resignation|instrument in writing]] declaring the decision.\n\nReflecting the fledgling status of the US at the time, the Department of State under Secretary Jefferson comprised only six personnel, two diplomatic posts (in London and Paris), and 10 consular posts.<ref name=\":0\"/> When Jefferson took charge of the department, one clerk oversaw The Foreign Office and another oversaw the Home Office. Congress authorized the department hire a chief clerk for each office in June 1790, but the offices were consolidated under a single clerk the following month.{{Sfn|Short|1923|pp=114-115}} In 1793, responsibility over patents was transferred from the cabinet to the Department of State.

Combined with the common practice of appointing individuals based on politics or patronage, rather than merit, this led the department to largely favor those with political networks and wealth, rather than skill and knowledge.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rogers Act |url=https://u-s-history.com/pages/h1471.html |access-date=November 26, 2020 |website=u-s-history.com |archive-date=January 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119080917/https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1471.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1833, Secretary of State [[Louis McLane]] oversaw a major restructure of the Department of State into a formal collection of seven bureaus: the Diplomatic Bureau; the Consular Bureau; the Home Bureau; the Bureau of Archives, Laws, and Commissions; the Bureau of Pardons and Remissions, Copyrights, and the Care of the Library; the Disbursing and Superintending Bureau; and the Translating and Miscellaneous Bureau. His successor [[John Forsyth (politician)|John Forsyth]] reduced this number to just four the following year, overseen by a chief clerk: the Diplomatic Bureau; the Consular Bureau; the Home Bureau; and the Keeper of the Archives, Translator, and Disbursing Agent.{{sfn|Short|1923|p=116}}\n\nThe office of Commissioner of Patents was created in 1836.{{Sfn|Short|1923|p=117}} In 1842, the Department of State was required to report to Congress on foreign commercial systems, and a clerk within the department was assigned the responsibility of arranging this information. This position was established as the Superintendent of Statistics in 1854 and the Statistical Office was created within the department.{{Sfn|Short|1923|p=117}} In 1853, the office of [[United States Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]] was created to oversee the heads of each bureau.{{Sfn|Short|1923|p=117}}\n\nA Commissioner of Immigration existed between 1864 and 1868. An Examiner of Claims was established in 1868 to address claims by American citizens against foreign nations, but it was abolished in 1868 and then reestablished in 1870 under the newly established Law Bureau.{{Sfn|Short|1923|p=227}} In 1870, Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] reorganized the department into twelve bureaus: the Chief Clerk's Bureau, two Diplomatic Bureaus, two Consular Bureaus, the Law Bureau, the Bureau of Accounts, the Statistical Bureau, the Bureau of Translations, the Bureau of Pardons and Commissions, the Bureau of Domestic Records, and the Passport Bureau. The bureaus of law, translations, and domestic records each consisted of a single person responsible for that duty.{{Sfn|Short|1923|p=226}} A mail division was established in 1872 and the office of Keeper of Rolls was made independent of the Chief Clerk's Bureau in 1873.{{Sfn|Short|1923|p=227}}\n\nCongress legally recognized the bureau system and provided official salaries for some bureau positions in 1873.{{Sfn|Short|1923|p=227}} Following Congressional recognition, several acts of Congress modified the structure of the bureaus between 1874 and 1882.{{Sfn|Short|1923|p=228}} At the end of the nineteenth century, the department consisted of the Chief Clerk's Bureau, the Diplomatic Bureau, the Consular Bureau, the Bureau of Accounts, the Bureau of Foreign Commerce, the Bureau of Appointments, and the Bureau of Archives. Other offices, such as that of translator, also operated separately from the bureau system.{{Sfn|Short|1923|pp=228-229}}\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nIn 1903, the Bureau of Foreign Commerce was transferred to the newly created [[United States Department of Commerce and Labor|Department of Commerce and Labor]], and the bureau was replaced by an office to facilitate the transfer of information between consular offices and the new department. The Passport Bureau was restored the same year, and its name was changed to the Bureau of Citizenship in 1907.{{Sfn|Short|1923|pp=229-230}} The department underwent a major reform in 1909 when Congress expanded its funding. Separate divisions were established within the Department for Latin American Affairs, Far Eastern Affairs, Near Eastern Affairs, Western European Affairs, and Information.{{Sfn|Short|1923|p=231}} An additional Division of Mexican Affairs was established in 1915.{{Sfn|Short|1923|p=232}} The Bureau of Trade Relations was abolished in 1912 and replaced by an Office of Foreign Trade Advisers, and the Office of the Adviser on Commercial Treaties was split from this office in 1916.{{Sfn|Short|1923|p=232}}\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the Bureau of Citizenship was tasked with vetting every person who entered or departed from the United States to ensure public safety. New branches of the Bureau of Citizenship were opened in New York and San Francisco. In the final months of World War I, the Bureau of Citizenship was split into the Division of Passport Control and the Visa Office. Other changes made during World War I include the conversion of the Division of Information into the Division of Foreign Intelligence in 1917 and the establishment of the Correspondence Bureau in 1918.{{Sfn|Short|1923|pp=232-233}} The Division of Russian Affairs was established in 1919, and the Division of Political Information was established in 1920. The Department of State underwent its first major overhaul with the [[Rogers Act|Rogers Act of 1924]], which merged the diplomatic and consular services into the [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]], a professionalized personnel system under which the [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] is authorized to assign [[diplomat]]s abroad. An extremely difficult Foreign Service examination was also implemented to ensure highly qualified recruits, along with a merit-based system of promotions. The Rogers Act also created the Board of the Foreign Service, which advises the Secretary of State on managing the Foreign Service, and the Board of Examiners of the Foreign Service, which administers the examination process.\n\nThe post-Second World War period saw an unprecedented increase in funding and staff commensurate with the US's emergence as a superpower and its competition with the Soviet Union in the subsequent Cold War.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=Department History - Office of the Historian |url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory |access-date=November 26, 2020 |website=history.state.gov |archive-date=November 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201122192219/https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory |url-status=live }}</ref> Consequently, the number of domestic and overseas employees grew from roughly 2,000 in 1940 to over 13,000 in 1960.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn accordance with the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism, the U.S. State Department established the [[Rewards for Justice Program|Rewards for Justice program]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rewards for Justice |url=https://2017-2021.state.gov/rewards-for-justice/ |access-date=December 15, 2023 |website=United States Department of State |language=en-US |archive-date=December 15, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231215181847/https://2017-2021.state.gov/rewards-for-justice/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Rewards For Justice program offered money as an incentive for information leading to the arrest of leaders of terrorist groups, financiers of terrorism, including any individual that abide in plotting terror attacks by cooperating with extremist groups.

William Fulbright]] in 1946. Under the Fulbright Program, competitively selected US citizens may become eligible for scholarships to study, conduct research, or exercise their talents abroad; and citizens of other countries may qualify to do the same in the United States. The program was established to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries through the exchange of persons, knowledge, and skills.\n\nThe Fulbright Program provides 8,000 grants annually to undertake graduate study, advanced research, university lecturing, and classroom teaching. In the 2015\u201316 cycle, 17% and 24% of American applicants were successful in securing research and English Teaching Assistance grants, respectively.
