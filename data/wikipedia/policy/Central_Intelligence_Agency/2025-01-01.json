Donovan, who envisioned an intelligence service that could operate globally to counter communist threats and provide crucial intelligence directly to the President.<ref name=:3>Tim Weiner, ''Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA'' (New York: Doubleday, 2007).</ref> \n\nDonovan proposed the idea to President Roosevelt in 1944, suggesting the creation of a \"Central Intelligence Service\" that would continue peacetime operations similar to those of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which he led during World War II.<ref name=:3/> Upon President Roosevelt's death, the new president Harry Truman inherited a presidency largely uninformed about key wartime projects and global intelligence activities. Truman's initial view of the proposed central intelligence agency was that of a simple information gathering entity that would function more as a global news service rather than a spy network. His vision starkly contrasted with Donovan's, which focused on avoiding the creation of an American version of the [[Gestapo]].<ref>Tim Weiner, ''Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA'' (New York: Doubleday, 2007), chapter 1.</ref>\n\nOn September 20, 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, Truman signed an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] dissolving the OSS.

Kennedy]] presenting the [[National Security Medal]] to [[Allen Dulles]] on November 28, 1961]]\nIn 1949, Colonel [[Adib Shishakli]] rose to power in Syria in a CIA-backed coup. Four years later, he would be overthrown by the military, [[Ba'ath]]ists, and [[Communism|communists]]. The CIA and MI6 started funding right-wing members of the military but suffered a huge setback in the aftermath of the [[Suez Crisis]]. CIA Agent Rocky Stone, who had played a minor role in the 1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat, was working at the [[Damascus]] embassy as a diplomat but was the station chief. Syrian officers on the CIA dole quickly appeared on television stating that they had received money from \"corrupt and sinister Americans\" \"in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria.\"{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=139}} Syrian forces surrounded the embassy and rousted Agent Stone, who confessed and subsequently made history as the first American diplomat expelled from an Arab nation. This strengthened ties between Syria and Egypt, helping establish the [[United Arab Republic]], and poisoning the well for the US for the foreseeable future.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=139}}\n\n===Indonesia===\n{{Main|CIA activities in Indonesia}}\n{{See also|Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u201366}}\nThe charismatic leader of [[Indonesia]] was President [[Sukarno]]. His declaration of neutrality in the [[Cold War]] put the suspicions of the CIA on him. After Sukarno hosted [[Bandung Conference]], promoting the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], the Eisenhower White House responded with NSC 5518 authorizing \"all feasible covert means\" to move Indonesia into the Western sphere.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=143}}\n\nThe U.S. had no clear policy on Indonesia. Eisenhower sent his special assistant for security operations, F. M. Dearborn Jr., to Jakarta. His report that there was high instability, and that the US lacked stable allies, reinforced the domino theory. Indonesia suffered from what he described as \"subversion by democracy\".{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=145}} The CIA decided to attempt another military coup in Indonesia, where the Indonesian military was trained by the US, had a strong professional relationship with the US military, had a pro-American officer corps that strongly supported their government, and a strong belief in civilian control of the military, instilled partly by its close association with the US military.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=146}}\n\nOn September 25, 1957, Eisenhower ordered the CIA to start a revolution in Indonesia with the goal of regime change. Three days later, ''Blitz'', a Soviet-controlled weekly in India,{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vf9ZJx8WkjQC&q=blitz&pg=PA148 170]}} reported that the US was plotting to overthrow Sukarno. The story was picked up by the media in Indonesia. One of the first parts of the operation was an 11,500-ton US Navy [[USS Thomaston (LSD-28)|ship]] landing at [[Sumatra]], delivering weapons for as many as 8,000 potential revolutionaries.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vf9ZJx8WkjQC&pg=PA148 148]}}\n\nIn support of the [[Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia]]-[[Permesta]] Movement, formed by dissident military commanders in Central Sumatera and North Sulawesi with the aim of overthrowing the Sukarno regime, a [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26]] piloted by CIA agent [[Allen Lawrence Pope]] attacked Indonesian military targets in April and May 1958.<ref>{{cite book | last=Roadnight | first=Andrew | title=United States Policy towards Indonesia in the Truman and Eisenhower Years | year=2002 | pages=162 | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | location=New York | isbn=978-0-333-79315-2 }}</ref> The CIA described the airstrikes to the President as attacks by \"dissident planes.\" Pope's B-26 was shot down over Ambon, Indonesia on May 18, 1958, and he bailed out. When he was captured, the Indonesian military found his personnel records, after-action reports, and his membership card for the officer's club at [[Clark Field]]. On March 9, [[John Foster Dulles|Foster Dulles]], the Secretary of State, and brother of [[Director of Central Intelligence|DCI]] [[Allen Dulles]] made a public statement calling for a revolt against communist despotism under Sukarno. Three days later, the CIA reported to the White House that the Indonesian Army's actions against the CIA-supported revolution were suppressing communism.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=153}}\n\nAfter Indonesia, Eisenhower displayed mistrust of both the CIA and its director, Allen Dulles. Dulles too displayed mistrust of the CIA itself. Abbot Smith, a CIA analyst who later became chief of the Office of National Estimates, said, \"We had constructed for ourselves a picture of the USSR, and whatever happened had to be made to fit into this picture. Intelligence estimators can hardly commit a more abominable sin.\" On December 16, Eisenhower received a report from his intelligence board of consultants that said the agency was \"incapable of making objective appraisals of its own intelligence information as well as its own operations.\"{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=154}}\n\n===Democratic Republic of the Congo===\n{{Main|CIA activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}\nIn the election of [[Patrice Lumumba]] as prime minister, and his acceptance of Soviet support during the [[Congo Crisis]], the CIA saw another possible Cuba. This view swayed the White House. Eisenhower ordered that Lumumba be \"eliminated.\" In September 1960, President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] ordered the dismissal of Lumumba and his cabinet. The CIA delivered a quarter of a million dollars to [[Joseph Mobutu]] in October, their favored Congolese political figure. Lumumba was imprisoned by Mobutu in December and then handed over to [[Katanga Province|Katangan]] authorities who, with the aid of Belgium, executed him by firing squad in January 1961.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=163}}\n\n===1960 U-2 incident===\n{{Main|1960 U-2 incident}}\n[[File:New Headquarters Building Atrium - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|Suspended from the ceiling of the glass-enclosed atrium: three models of the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]], [[A-12 Oxcart|Lockheed A-12]], and [[Lockheed D-21|D-21]] [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone]]. These models are exact replicas at one-sixth scale of the real planes. All three had photographic capabilities. The U-2 was one of the first espionage planes developed by the CIA. The A-12 set unheralded flight records. The D-21 drone was one of the first crewless aircraft ever built. [[Lockheed Martin]] donated all three models to the CIA.]]\n\nAfter the [[bomber gap]] came the [[missile gap]]. Eisenhower wanted to use the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] to disprove the Missile Gap, but he had banned U-2 overflights of the USSR after meeting Secretary [[Khrushchev]] at [[Camp David]]. Another reason the President objected to the use of the U-2 was that, in the nuclear age, the intelligence he needed most was on their intentions, without which, the US would face a paralysis of intelligence. He was particularly worried that U-2 flights could be seen as preparations for first-strike attacks. He had high hopes for an upcoming meeting with Khrushchev in Paris. Eisenhower finally gave in to CIA pressure to authorize a 16-day window for flights, which was extended an additional six days because of poor weather. On May 1, 1960, the [[Soviet Air Forces]] shot down a U-2 flying over Soviet territory. To Eisenhower, the ensuing coverup destroyed his perceived honesty and his hope of leaving a legacy of thawing relations with Khrushchev. Eisenhower later said that the U-2 coverup was the greatest regret of his presidency.<ref name=Ashes>{{cite book |last1=Weiner |first1=Tim |title=Legacy of ashes: The history of the CIA |date=2007 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=978-0-385-51445-3 |edition=1st |ref=Ashes |url=https://archive.org/details/legacyofasheshis00wein }}</ref>{{rp|160}}\n\n===Dominican Republic===\nIn the [[Dominican Republic]], the human rights abuses of Generalissimo [[Rafael Trujillo]] lasted more than three decades before the United States severed diplomatic relations with the nation in August 1960. The CIA's Special Group armed Dominicans to assassinate Trujillo, but Kennedy paused the plan when he became president. Kennedy allowed the distribution of four additional machine guns, and Trujillo died from gunshot wounds two weeks later, on May 30, 1961. In the aftermath, Robert Kennedy wrote that the CIA had succeeded where it had failed many times in the past, but in the face of that success, it was caught flatfooted, having failed to plan what to do next.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=172}}\n\n===Bay of Pigs===\n{{Main|Bay of Pigs invasion}}\n{{See also|CIA assassination attempts on Fidel Castro}}\n{{See also|History of the Central Intelligence Agency#Cuba}}\n[[File:Sam Giancana.jpg|thumb|[[Sam Giancana]] (pictured), [[Santo Trafficante Jr.|Santo Trafficante]], and others, who were recruited by the CIA to assassinate [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Snow |first=Anita |date=June 27, 2007 |title=CIA Plot to Kill Castro Detailed |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/AR2007062700190.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |location=Washington, DC |agency=AP |access-date=April 17, 2018 |archive-date=March 20, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220320193425/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/AR2007062700190.html |url-status=live }}</ref>|214x214px]]\n\nThe CIA welcomed [[Fidel Castro]] on his visit to [[Washington, D.C.]], and gave him a face-to-face briefing. The CIA hoped that Castro would bring about a friendly democratic government and planned to support his government with money and guns. By December 11, 1959, however, a memo reached the DCI's desk recommending Castro's \"elimination.\" Dulles replaced the word \"elimination\" with \"removal,\" and set the scheme into action. By mid-August 1960, [[Richard M. Bissell Jr.|Dick Bissell]] sought, with the full backing of the CIA, to hire the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] to assassinate Castro.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=161}}\n\nThe [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] was a failed military invasion of [[Cuba]] undertaken by the CIA-sponsored paramilitary group [[Brigade 2506]] on April 17, 1961. A counter-revolutionary military, trained and funded by the CIA, Brigade 2506 fronted the armed wing of the [[Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front|Democratic Revolutionary Front]] (DRF) and intended to overthrow Castro's [[Politics of Cuba|increasingly communist government]]. Launched from [[Guatemala]], the invading force was defeated within three days by the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]], under Castro's direct command. US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was concerned at the direction Castro's government was taking, and in March 1960, Eisenhower allocated $13.1&nbsp;million to the CIA to plan his overthrow. The CIA proceeded to organize the operation with the aid of various Cuban counter-revolutionary forces, training Brigade 2506 in Guatemala. Over 1,400 paramilitaries set out for Cuba by boat on April 13 for a [[Amphibious warfare|marine invasion]]. Two days later on April 15, eight CIA-supplied [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26]] bombers attacked Cuban airfields. On the night of April 16, the land invasion began in the [[Bay of Pigs]], but by April 20, the invaders finally surrendered. The failed invasion strengthened the position of Castro's leadership as well as his ties with the USSR. This led eventually to the events of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962. The invasion was a major embarrassment for [[US foreign policy]]. \n\nThe Taylor Board was commissioned to determine what went wrong in Cuba. The Board came to the same conclusion that the Jan '61 President's Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities had concluded, and many other reviews prior, and to come, that Covert Action had to be completely isolated from intelligence and analysis. The [[Central Intelligence Agency Office of Inspector General|Inspector General of the CIA]] investigated the Bay of Pigs. He concluded that there was a need to improve the organization and management of the CIA drastically. \n{{clear left}}\n\n===Cuba: Terrorism and sabotage===\n{{Main|Operation Mongoose}}\n{{See also|Operation 40}}\nAfter the failure of the attempted invasion at the Bay of Pigs, the CIA proposed a program of [[sabotage]] and [[Terrorism|terrorist attacks]] against civilian and military targets in Cuba, with the stated intent to bring down the Cuban administration and institute a new government.

These were failures; the Deputy Chief for Project Tiger, Captain Do Van Tien, admitted that he was an agent for [[Hanoi]].{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=213}}\n\n===Johnson===\nIn the face of the failure of Project Tiger, [[the Pentagon]] wanted CIA paramilitary forces to participate in their Op Plan 64A. This resulted in the CIA's foreign paramilitaries being put under the command of the DOD, a move seen as a slippery slope inside the CIA, a slide from covert action towards militarization.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=237}}\n\nThe antiwar movement rapidly expanded across the United States during the [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson presidency]]. Johnson wanted CIA Director Richard Helms to substantiate Johnson's hunch that Moscow and Beijing were financing and influencing the American antiwar movement. Thus, in the fall of 1967, the CIA launched a domestic surveillance program code-named [[Operation CHAOS|Chaos]] that would linger for a total of seven years. Police departments across the country cooperated in tandem with the agency, amassing a \"computer index of 300,000 names of American people and organizations, and extensive files on 7,200 citizens.\" Helms hatched a \"Special Operations Group\" in which \"[eleven] CIA officers grew long hair, learned the jargon of the New Left, and went off to infiltrate peace groups in the United States and Europe.\"{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=285}}\n\nA CIA analyst's assessment of Vietnam was that the U.S. was \"becoming progressively divorced from reality... [and] proceeding with far more courage than wisdom\".{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=248}}\n\n===Nixon===\n{{See also|History of the Central Intelligence Agency#Nixon}}\nIn 1971, the NSA and CIA were engaged in domestic spying; the DOD was eavesdropping on [[Henry Kissinger]]. The White House and Camp David were wired for sound. Nixon and Kissinger were eavesdropping on their aides, as well as reporters. Famously, Nixon's [[White House Plumbers|Plumbers]] had in their number many former CIA officers, including [[Howard Hunt]], [[James W. McCord Jr.|Jim McCord]], and [[Eugenio Martinez]]. On July 7, 1971, [[John Ehrlichman]], Nixon's domestic policy chief, told DCI Cushman, Nixon's hatchet-man in the CIA, to let Cushman \"know that [Hunt] was, in fact, doing some things for the President... you should consider he has pretty much ''carte blanche''\"{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=319}}\n\nOn June 17, Nixon's Plumbers were caught burglarizing the DNC offices in the Watergate. On June 23, DCI Helms was ordered by the White House to wave the FBI off using national security as a pretext. The new DCI, Walters, another Nixon hack, called the acting director of the FBI and told him to drop the investigation as ordered.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=321}} On June 26, Nixon's counsel [[John Dean]] ordered DCI Walters to pay the plumbers untraceable hush money. The CIA was the only part of the government that had the power to make off the book payments, but it could only be done on the orders of the CI, or, if he was out of the country, the DCI. The acting director of the FBI started breaking ranks. He demanded the CIA produce a signed document attesting to the national security threat of the investigation. McCord's lawyer contacted the CIA informing them that McCord had been offered a Presidential pardon if he fingered the CIA, testifying that the break-in had been an operation of the CIA. Nixon had long been frustrated by what he saw as a liberal infection inside the CIA and had been trying for years to tear the CIA out by its roots. McCord wrote, \"If [DCI] Helms goes (takes the fall) and the Watergate operation is laid at the CIA's feet, where it does not belong, every tree in the forest will fall. It will be a scorched desert.\"{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=322}}[[File:Operation Condor participants.svg|thumb|[[Operation Condor]] participants. {{legend striped|#71c934|#008100|active members}} {{legend|#000081|collaborators (United States)}}]]\n\nOn November 13, after Nixon's landslide re-election, Nixon told Kissinger \"[I intend] to ruin the Foreign Service. I mean ruin it \u2013 the old Foreign Service \u2013 and to build a new one.\" He had similar designs for the CIA and intended to replace Helms with [[James Schlesinger]].{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=322}} Nixon had told Helms that he was on the way out, and promised that Helms could stay on until his 60th birthday, the mandatory retirement age. On February 2, Nixon broke that promise, carrying through with his intention to \"remove the deadwood\" from the CIA. \"Get rid of the clowns\" was his order to the incoming CI. Kissinger had been running the CIA since the beginning of Nixon's presidency, but Nixon impressed on Schlesinger that he must appear to Congress to be in charge, averting their suspicion of Kissinger's involvement.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=323}} Nixon also hoped that Schlesinger could push through broader changes in the intelligence community that he had been working towards for years, the creation of a Director of National Intelligence, and spinning off the covert action part of the CIA into a separate organ. Before Helms would leave office, he would destroy every tape he had secretly made of meetings in his office, and many of the papers on [[Project MKUltra]]. In Schlesinger's 17-week tenure, in his assertion to President Nixon that it was \"imperative to cut back on 'the prominence of CIA operations' around the world,\" the director fired more than 1,500 employees.<ref>Weiner Tim 2007''A Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA'' New York Doubleday p. 339</ref> As Watergate threw the spotlight on the CIA, Schlesinger, who had been kept in the dark about the CIA's involvement, decided he needed to know what skeletons were in the closet.\n\nThis became the [[Family Jewels (CIA)|Family Jewels]]. It included information linking the CIA to the assassination of foreign leaders, the illegal surveillance of some 7,000 U.S. citizens involved in the antiwar movement ([[Operation CHAOS]]), its [[Project MKUltra|experiments on U.S. and Canadian citizens without their knowledge]], secretly giving them [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] (among other things) and observing the results.<ref name=\"'70s 49\"/> This prompted Congress to create the [[Church Committee]] in the Senate, and the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Pike Committee]] in the House. President [[Gerald Ford]] created the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]],<ref name=\"'70s 49\"/> and issued an executive order prohibiting the assassination of foreign leaders. DCI Colby leaked the papers to the press, later he stated that he believed that providing Congress with this information was the correct thing to do, and ultimately in the CIA's interests.<ref name=\"TMNK\">{{cite video |people=Carl Colby (director) |date=September 2011 |title=The Man Nobody Knew: In Search of My Father, CIA Spymaster William Colby |url=http://firstrunfeatures.com/themannobodyknew/ |medium=Motion picture |publisher=Act 4 Entertainment |location=New York City |access-date=September 18, 2011 |ref=September 15, 2011 |archive-date=April 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409090233/http://firstrunfeatures.com/themannobodyknew/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Congressional investigations===\nActing Attorney General [[Laurence Silberman]] learned of the existence of the Family Jewels and issued a subpoena for them, prompting eight congressional investigations on the domestic spying activities of the CIA. [[Bill Colby]]'s short tenure as DCI would end with the [[Halloween Massacre (Ford administration)|Halloween Massacre]]. His replacement was [[George Herbert Walker Bush|George H. W. Bush]]. At the time, the DOD had control of 80% of the intelligence budget.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=347}} Communication and coordination between the CIA and the DOD would suffer greatly under Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The CIA's budget for hiring clandestine officers had been squeezed out by the paramilitary operations in Southeast Asia, and the government's poor popularity further strained hiring. This left the agency bloated with middle management, and anemic in younger officers. With employee training taking five years, the agency's only hope would be on the trickle of new officers coming to fruition years in the future. The CIA would see another setback as communists would take Angola. [[William J. Casey]], a member of Ford's Intelligence Advisory Board, obtained Bush's approval to allow a team from outside the CIA to produce Soviet military estimates as a \"Team B\".

The CIA had maintained a network of spies in Iran, but in 1989 a CIA mistake compromised every agent they had in there, and the CIA had no agents in Iraq. In the weeks before the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]], the CIA downplayed the military buildup. During the war, CIA estimates of Iraqi abilities and intentions flip-flopped and were rarely accurate. In one particular case, the DOD had asked the CIA to identify military targets to bomb. One target the CIA identified was an underground shelter. The CIA did not know that it was a civilian bomb shelter. In a rare instance, the CIA correctly determined that the coalition forces efforts were coming up short in their efforts to destroy SCUD missiles. Congress took away the CIA's role in interpreting spy-satellite photos, putting the CIA's satellite intelligence operations under the auspices of the military. The CIA created its office of military affairs, which operated as \"second-echelon support for the Pentagon. .. answering ... questions from military men [like] 'how wide is this road?{{'\"}}{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=428}}\n\n===Fall of the Soviet Union===\n{{See also|History of the Central Intelligence Agency#Fall of the USSR}}\n[[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s announcement of the unilateral reduction of 500,000 Soviet troops took the CIA by surprise.

Too often the CIA relied on inexperienced people supposedly deemed experts. Bob Gates had preceded Doug MacEachin as Chief of Soviet analysis, and he had never visited the Soviet Union. Few officers, even those stationed in the country, spoke the language of the people on whom they spied. And the CIA could not send agents to respond to developing situations. The CIA analysis of Russia during the Cold War was either driven by ideology, or by politics. [[William J.

To force [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] to withdraw his troops from Kosovo, the CIA had been invited to provide military targets for bombings, wherein the agency's analysts used tourist maps to determine the location.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA|last=Weiner|first=Tim|publisher=Anchor Books|year=2008|location=New York |pages=546}}</ref> However, the agency incorrectly provided the coordinates of the Chinese Embassy as a target resulting in its bombing.

One of them was the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]], where traces of chemical weapon precursors had been detected.

He was expelled from the country. In 1996, the CIA created a team to hunt bin Laden. They were trading information with the Sudanese until, on the word of a source that would later be found to be a fabricator, the CIA closed its Sudan station later that year. In 1998, bin Laden would declare war on America, and, on August 7, [[1998 United States embassy bombings|strike in Tanzania and Nairobi]]. On October 12, 2000, Al Qaeda [[USS Cole bombing|bombed the USS ''Cole'']]. In the first days of George W. Bush's presidency, Al Qaeda threats were ubiquitous in daily presidential CIA briefings, but it may have become a case of false alarm. The agency's predictions were dire but carried little weight, and the focus of the president and his defense staff were elsewhere. The CIA arranged the arrests of suspected Al Qaeda members through cooperation with foreign agencies, but the CIA could not definitively say what effect these arrests have had, and it could not gain hard intelligence from those captured. The President had asked the CIA if Al Qaeda could plan attacks in the US. On August 6, Bush received a daily briefing with the headline, not based on current, solid intelligence, \"Al Qaeda determined to strike inside the US.\" The US had been hunting bin Laden since 1996 and had had several opportunities, but neither Clinton, nor Bush had wanted to risk taking an active role in a murky assassination plot, and the perfect opportunity had never materialized for a DCI that would have given him the reassurances he needed to take the plunge. That day, [[Richard A.

Among the key changes disclosed include the establishment of a new directorate, the Directorate of Digital Innovation, which is responsible for designing and crafting the digital technology to be used by the agency, to keep the CIA always ahead of its enemies. The Directorate of Digital Innovation will also train CIA staff in the use of this technology, to prepare the CIA for the future, and it will also use the technological revolution to deal with cyber-terrorism and other perceived threats. The new directorate will be the chief cyber-espionage arm of the agency going forward.<ref name=\"PR2015-03-06\">{{cite web |title=Message to the Workforce from CIA Director John Brennan: Our Agency's Blueprint for the Future |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2015-press-releases-statements/message-to-workforce-agencys-blueprint-for-the-future.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309230914/https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2015-press-releases-statements/message-to-workforce-agencys-blueprint-for-the-future.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 9, 2015 |website=Central Intelligence Agency |date=March 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther changes which were announced include the formation of a Talent Development Center of Excellence, the enhancement and expansion of the CIA University and the creation of the office of the Chancellor to head the CIA University to consolidate and unify recruitment and training efforts. The office of the executive director will be empowered and expanded, and the secretarial offices serving the executive director will be streamlined. The restructuring of the entire Agency is to be revamped according to a new model whereby governance is modeled after the structure and hierarchy of corporations, said to increase the efficiency of workflow and to enable the executive director to manage day-to-day activity significantly. As well, another stated intention was to establish 'Mission Centers', each one to deal with a specific geographic region of the world, which will bring the full collaboration and joint efforts of the five Directorates together under one roof. While the Directorate heads will still retain ultimate authority over their respective Directorate, the Mission Centers will be led by an assistant director who will work with the capabilities and talents of all five Directorates on mission-specific goals for the parts of the world which they are given responsibility for.<ref name=\"PR2015-03-06\"/>\n\nThe unclassified version of the document ends with the announcement that the National Clandestine Service (NCS) will be reverting to its original Directorate name, the Directorate of Operations. The Directorate of Intelligence is also being renamed. It will now be the Directorate of Analysis.<ref name=\"PR2015-03-06\"/>\n\n===Drones===\nA new policy introduced by President Barack Obama removed the authority of the CIA to launch drone attacks and allowed these attacks only under [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] command.

Part of the problem, according to Author Tim Weiner, is that political appointees designated by recent presidential administrations have sometimes been under-qualified or over-zealous politically. Large scale purges have taken place in the upper echelons of the CIA, and when those talented individuals are pushed out the door, they have frequently gone on to found new independent intelligence companies which can suck up CIA talent.<ref name=\"Ashes\" /> Another part of the contracting problem comes from Congressional restrictions on the number of employees within the IC. According to Hillhouse, this resulted in 70% of the de facto workforce of the CIA's National Clandestine Service being made up of contractors. \"After years of contributing to the increasing reliance upon contractors, Congress is now providing a framework for the conversion of contractors into federal government employees{{snd}}more or less.\"<ref name=\"Hillhouse2007-12-18\"/> The number of independent contractors hired by the Federal government across the intelligence community has skyrocketed. So, not only does the CIA have trouble hiring, but those hires will frequently leave their permanent employ for shorter term contract gigs which have much higher pay and allow for more career mobility.<ref name=\"Ashes\" />\n\nAs with most government agencies, building equipment often is contracted. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), responsible for the development and operation of airborne and spaceborne sensors, long was a joint operation of the CIA and the United States Department of Defense. The NRO had been significantly involved in the design of such sensors, but the NRO, then under DCI authority, contracted more of the design that had been their tradition, and to a contractor without extensive reconnaissance experience, [[Boeing]]. The next-generation satellite [[Future Imagery Architecture]] project \"how does heaven look,\" which missed objectives after $4&nbsp;billion in cost overruns, was the result of this contract.<ref name=\"AWST2005-03-20\">{{Cite journal |title=SBIRS High in the Red Again |date=March 20, 2005 |first1=Amy |last1=Butler |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&id=news%2F03215p02.xml |journal=Aviation Week |access-date=January 14, 2008 |archive-date=April 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429022651/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&id=news%2F03215p02.xml |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/washington/11satellite.html |title=In Death of Spy Satellite Program, Lofty Plans and Unrealistic Bids |last=Taubman |first=Philip |date=November 11, 2007 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 29, 2013 |archive-date=April 8, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408013929/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/washington/11satellite.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSome of the cost problems associated with intelligence come from one agency, or even a group within an agency, not accepting the compartmented security practices for individual projects, requiring expensive duplication.<ref name=BenRich>{{cite book |title=Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years of Lockheed |first=Ben R. |last=Rich |publisher=Back Bay Books |year=1996 |isbn=0-316-74330-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/skunkworks00benr }}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n{{Main|List of CIA controversies}}\n{{See also|Human rights violations by the CIA|Allegations of CIA drug trafficking|CIA influence on public opinion|Project Mockingbird|Extraordinary rendition|Assassination of Orlando Letelier|Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n Flight 455|Operation Condor}}\nThroughout its history, the CIA has been the subject of numerous controversies, both at home and abroad. The agency ran an operation code-named \"Chaos\" that ran from 1967 to 1974 where they routinely performed surveillance on Americans who were a part of various peace groups protesting the [[Vietnam War]]. The operation was authorized by order of President Lyndon B. Johnson in October 1967 as the CIA gathered the information of 300,000 American people and organizations and extensive files on 7,200 citizens.
