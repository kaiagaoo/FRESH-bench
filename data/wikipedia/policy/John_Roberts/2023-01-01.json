She sued, alleging that an adult would have only received a citation for the same offense, while children must be detained until parents are notified. The D.C.

Maryland]]'', Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] gave a very broad and expansive reading to the powers of the Federal Government and explained generally that if the ends be legitimate, then any means chosen to achieve them are within the power of the Federal Government, and cases interpreting that, throughout the years, have come down. Certainly, by the time ''[[United States v. Lopez|Lopez]]'' was decided, many of us had learned in [[law school]] that it was just sort of a formality to say that [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] was affected and that cases weren't going to be thrown out that way. ''Lopez'' certainly breathed new life into the [[Commerce Clause]].\n\nI think it remains to be seen, in subsequent decisions, how rigorous a showing, and in many cases, it is just a showing. It's not a question of an abstract fact, does this affect interstate commerce or not, but has this body, the Congress, demonstrated the impact on interstate commerce that drove them to legislate? That's a very important factor. It wasn't present in ''Lopez'' at all. I think the members of Congress had heard the same thing I had heard in law school, that this is unimportant\u2014and they hadn't gone through the process of establishing a record in that case.<ref name=\"multiple1\">[http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/108hrg/92548.pdf ''Hearings before the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, 108th Congress, 1st Session''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121190047/http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/108hrg/92548.pdf |date=November 21, 2011 }}, [[United States Government Printing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]].

Justice Holmes described assessing the constitutionality of an act of Congress as the gravest duty that the Supreme Court is called upon to perform. ... It's a principle that is easily stated and needs to be observed in practice, as well as in theory.\n\nNow, the Court, of course, has the obligation, and has been recognized since ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', to assess the constitutionality of acts of Congress, and when those acts are challenged, it is the obligation of the Court to say what the law is. The determination of when deference to legislative policy judgments goes too far and becomes abdication of the judicial responsibility, and when scrutiny of those judgments goes too far on the part of the judges and becomes what I think is properly called [[judicial activism]], that is certainly the central dilemma of having an unelected, as you describe it correctly, undemocratic judiciary in a democratic republic.<ref name=\"multiple1\" />}}\n\n==== ''Stare decisis'' ====\nOn the subject of ''[[stare decisis]]'', referring to ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the decision overturning school [[Racial segregation|segregation]], Roberts said that \"the Court in that case, of course, overruled a prior decision.

Oregon]]'', which held that the [[Controlled Substances Act]] does not allow the [[United States Attorney General|United States attorney general]] to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the [[assisted suicide]] of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not [[federalism]].\n\nOn March 6, 2006, Roberts wrote the unanimous decision in ''[[Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights]]'' that colleges accepting federal money must allow military recruiters on campus, despite university objections to the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]]-initiated \"[[don't ask, don't tell]]\" policy.\n\n=== Campaign finance ===\nFollowing his concurrence in ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' (2010), Roberts wrote the majority decision for another landmark [[campaign finance]] case called ''[[McCutcheon v. FEC]]'' (2014).

Randolph]]'' (2006). The majority's decision prohibited police from searching a home if both occupants are present but one objected and the other consented. Roberts criticized the majority opinion as inconsistent with prior [[case law]] and for partly basing its reasoning on its perception of social custom. He said the social expectation test was flawed because the Fourth Amendment protects a legitimate expectation of privacy, not social expectations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Third Party Consent Searches After Georgia v.

Flowers]]'', siding with liberal justices of the court in ruling that, before a home is seized and sold in a tax-forfeiture sale, due diligence must be demonstrated and proper notification needs to be sent to the owners. Dissenting justices were [[Anthony Kennedy]], [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]], while Roberts's opinion was joined by [[David Souter]], [[Stephen Breyer]], [[John Paul Stevens]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. [[Samuel Alito]] did not participate.\n\n=== Abortion ===\nIn ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' (2007), Roberts voted with the majority to uphold the constitutionality of the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]]. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], writing for a five-justice majority, distinguished ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', and concluded that the Court's previous decision in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' did not prevent Congress from banning the procedure. The decision left the door open for future [[as-applied challenge]]s, and did not address the broader question of whether Congress had the authority to pass the law.<ref>{{cite web |title=Justice Thomas wrote separately to emphasize this: \"whether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-380.ZC.html |publisher=law.cornell.edu |access-date=May 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414013714/https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-380.ZC.html |archive-date=April 14, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] filed a concurring opinion, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''[[Roe v.
