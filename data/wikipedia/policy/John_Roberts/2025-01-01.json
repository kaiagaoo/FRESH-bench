Maryland]]'', Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] gave a very broad and expansive reading to the powers of the federal government and explained generally that if the ends be legitimate, then any means chosen to achieve them are within the power of the federal government, and cases interpreting that, throughout the years, have come down. Certainly, by the time ''[[United States v.

''Lopez'' certainly breathed new life into the [[Commerce Clause]].\n\nI think it remains to be seen, in subsequent decisions, how rigorous a showing, and in many cases, it is just a showing. It's not a question of an abstract fact\u2014does this affect interstate commerce or not\u2014but has this body, the Congress, demonstrated the impact on interstate commerce that drove them to legislate? That's a very important factor. It wasn't present in ''Lopez'' at all.
