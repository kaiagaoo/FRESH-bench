The UNSC is the only UN body with authority to issue [[United Nations Security Council resolution|resolutions]] that are binding on member states.\n\nLike the UN as a whole, the Security Council was created after [[World War II]] to address the failings of the [[League of Nations]] in maintaining [[world peace]]. It held its first session on 17 January 1946 but was largely paralyzed in the following decades by the [[Cold War]] between the United States and the Soviet Union (and their allies). Nevertheless, it authorized military interventions in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Congo Crisis]] and peacekeeping missions in [[Cyprus]], [[West New Guinea]], and the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. With the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], [[UN peacekeeping]] efforts increased dramatically in scale, with the Security Council authorizing major military and peacekeeping missions in [[Gulf War|Kuwait]], [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group|Namibia]], [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia|Cambodia]], [[United Nations Protection Force|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|Rwanda]], [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II|Somalia]], [[War in Darfur|Sudan]], and the [[Kivu conflict|Democratic Republic of the Congo]].\n\nThe Security Council consists of [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|fifteen members]], of which [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five are permanent]]:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/un-charter-full-text/|title=Article 23 (1) of the Charter of the United Nations|date=26 June 1945|website=www.un.org|publisher=[[United Nations]]|language=en|access-date=10 December 2018|archive-date=10 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410130442/https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/un-charter-full-text/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].

This veto right does not carry over into General Assembly matters or votes, which are non-binding. The other ten members are elected on a regional basis for a term of two years. The body's [[Presidency of the United Nations Security Council|presidency]] rotates monthly among its members.\n\n[[United Nations resolution|Resolutions]] of the Security Council are typically enforced by [[UN peacekeepers]], which consist of military forces voluntarily provided by member states and funded independently of the main UN budget. {{As of|2021|November}}, there have been 12 peacekeeping missions with over 87,000 personnel from 121 countries, with a total annual budget of approximately $6.3&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Data for November 2021|url=https://peacekeeping.un.org/sites/default/files/peacekeeping_missions_factsheet_246_nov2021_en.pdf|website=United Nations Peacekeeping|language=en|access-date=2022-06-19|archive-date=11 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220711144842/https://peacekeeping.un.org/sites/default/files/peacekeeping_missions_factsheet_246_nov2021_en.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background and creation ===\n{{Further|History of the United Nations}}\nIn the century prior to the UN's creation, several international treaty organizations and conferences had been formed to regulate conflicts between nations, such as the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=5}} Following the catastrophic loss of life in [[World War I]], the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] established the [[League of Nations]] to maintain harmony between the nations.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=8}} This organization successfully resolved some territorial disputes and created international structures for areas such as postal mail, aviation, and opium control, some of which would later be absorbed into the UN.{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=10}} However, the League lacked representation for colonial peoples (then half the world's population) and significant participation from several major powers, including the US, the [[USSR]], Germany, and Japan; it failed to act against the 1931 [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]], the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] in 1935, the 1937 [[Japanese occupation of China]], and Nazi expansions under [[Adolf Hitler]] that escalated into [[World War II]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=13\u201324}}\n\n[[File:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|[[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Franklin D.

The Soviet delegation argued that each nation should have an absolute veto that could block matters from even being discussed, while the British argued that nations should not be able to veto resolutions on disputes to which they were a party. At the [[Yalta Conference]] of February 1945, the American, British and Russian delegations agreed that each of the \"Big Five\" could veto any action by the council, but not procedural resolutions, meaning that the permanent members could not prevent debate on a resolution.{{sfn|Meisler|1995|pp=10\u201313}}\n\nOn 25 April 1945, the [[UN Conference on International Organization]] began in San Francisco, attended by fifty governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the [[United Nations Charter]].<ref name=unmilestones>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/aboutun/milestones.htm |title=Milestones in United Nations History |publisher=Department of Public Information, United Nations |access-date=22 November 2013 |archive-date=11 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111074909/https://www.un.org/aboutun/milestones.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref> At the conference, [[H.

On the one hand, they include bodies such as the Security Council Committee on Admission of New Members. On the other hand, both the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] were also created as subsidiary bodies of the Security Council.

As British historian Paul Kennedy writes, \"Everyone agrees that the present structure is flawed. But consensus on how to fix it remains out of reach.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=76}}\n\nThere has been discussion of increasing the number of permanent members. The countries which have made the strongest demands for permanent seats are Brazil, Germany, India and Japan. Japan and Germany, the main defeated powers in WWII, had been the UN's second- and third-largest funders, respectively, before China took over as the second largest funder in recent years, while Brazil and India are two of the largest contributors of troops to UN-mandated peace-keeping missions.\n\nItaly, another main defeated power in WWII and now the UN's sixth-largest funder, leads a movement known as [[Uniting for Consensus]] in opposition to the possible expansion of permanent seats. Core members of the group include Canada, South Korea, Spain, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Turkey, Argentina and Colombia. Their proposal is to create a new category of seats, still non-permanent, but elected for an extended duration (semi-permanent seats). As far as traditional categories of seats are concerned, the UfC proposal does not imply any change, but only the introduction of small and medium size states among groups eligible for regular seats. This proposal includes even the question of veto, giving a range of options that goes from abolition to limitation of the application of the veto only to Chapter VII matters.\n\nFormer UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] asked a team of advisers to come up with recommendations for reforming the United Nations by the end of 2004. One proposed measure is to increase the number of permanent members by five, which, in most proposals, would include Brazil, Germany, India and Japan (known as the [[G4 nations]]), one seat from Africa (most likely between Egypt, Nigeria or South Africa), and/or one seat from the [[Arab League]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2006-11-01-voa46.html |title=UN Security Council Reform May Shadow Annan's Legacy |date=1 November 2006 |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |access-date=11 December 2011 |archive-date=3 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203032517/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2006-11-01-voa46.html |url-status=live}}</ref> On 21 September 2004, the G4 nations issued a joint statement mutually backing each other's claim to permanent status, together with two African countries. Currently the proposal has to be accepted by two-thirds of the General Assembly (128 votes).\n\nThe permanent members, each holding the right of veto, announced their positions on Security Council reform reluctantly. The United States has unequivocally supported the permanent membership of Japan and lent its support to India and a small number of additional non-permanent members. The United Kingdom and France have essentially supported the G4 position, with the expansion of permanent and non-permanent members and the accession of Germany, Brazil, India and Japan to permanent member status, as well as an increase in the presence of African countries on the Council.

The Noble World Foundation (NWF) proposes a novel approach, suggesting that UNSC membership and veto power be shifted from individual states to sovereignty-pooling organizations like the European Union (EU). This proposal aligns with the UNSC's practice of regionally-based selection of non-permanent members, aiming to improve the Council's decision-making and effectiveness. The EU serves as a primary example of such pooled sovereignty, especially following the European Court of Justice's 1964 ruling that established the precedence of EU law over national laws of its member states. The NWF advocates that regional entities like the EU could be eligible for UN membership in the Security Council, enabling a significant reform without necessitating an amendment to the UN Charter.<ref>{{cite web |title=The urgent need for UNSC reform: A path to global peace\".
