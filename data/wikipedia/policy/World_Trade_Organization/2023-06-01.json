The first real{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} GATT trade rounds (1947 to 1960) concentrated on further reducing [[tariff]]s. Then the [[Kennedy Round]] in the mid-sixties brought about a GATT [[Dumping (pricing policy)|anti-dumping]] agreement and a section on development. The Tokyo Round during the seventies represented the first major attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on  [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers]], which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because not all GATT members accepted these [[plurilateral agreement]]s, they were often informally called \"codes\". (The Uruguay Round amended several of these codes and turned them into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft, and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two.<ref name=\" GY\">[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact4_e.htm The GATT Years: from Havana to Marrakesh] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20041211025038/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact4_e.htm |date= 11 December 2004 }}, WTO official site</ref>) Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to establish some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized multilateral treaty r\u00e9gime on a provisional basis.<ref name=\"F17\">\nFooter, M.E.

As globalization proceeds in today's society, the necessity of an [[International Organization]] to manage the trading systems has been of vital importance. As the trade volume increases, issues such as protectionism, trade barriers, subsidies, violation of intellectual property arise due to the differences in the trading rules of every nation. The World Trade Organization serves as the mediator between the nations when such problems arise. WTO could be referred to as the product of globalization and also as one of the most important organizations in today's globalized society.\n\nThe WTO is also a center of economic research and analysis: regular assessments of the global trade picture in its annual publications and research reports on specific topics are produced by the organization.<ref name=\"EA\">[http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/reser_e.htm Economic research and analysis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315190051/http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/reser_e.htm |date=15 March 2007 }}, WTO official site</ref> Finally, the WTO cooperates closely with the two other components of the [[Bretton Woods system]], the IMF and the World Bank.<ref name=\"B17\"/>\n\n==Principles of the trading system== <!-- \"WTO terms\" redirects here. If changing this section name, please update that redirect. -->\nThe WTO establishes a framework for trade policies; it does not define or specify outcomes. That is, it is concerned with setting the rules of \"trade policy.\" Five principles are of particular importance in understanding both the pre-1994 GATT and the WTO:\n# '''Non-discrimination'''. It has two major components: the [[most favored nation]] (MFN) rule and the [[national treatment]] policy. Both are embedded in the main WTO rules on goods, services, and intellectual property, but their precise scope and nature differ across these areas. The MFN rule requires that a WTO member must apply the same conditions on all trade with other WTO members, i.e., a WTO member has to grant the most favorable conditions under which it allows trade in a certain product type to all other WTO members.<ref name=\" H42\">B. Hoekman, ''The WTO: Functions and Basic Principles'', 42</ref> \"Grant someone a special favor and you have to do the same for all other WTO members.\"<ref name=\"PT\">[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm#seebox Principles of the Trading System] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211091642/http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm#seebox |date=11 December 2004 }}, WTO official site</ref> National treatment means that imported goods should be treated no less favorably than domestically produced goods (at least after the foreign goods have entered the market) and was introduced to tackle [[non-tariff barriers to trade]] (e.g. technical standards, security standards et al. discriminating against imported goods).<ref name=\"H42\"/>\n# '''Reciprocity'''. It reflects both a desire to limit the scope of [[Free rider problem|free-riding]] that may arise because of the MFN rule and a desire to obtain better access to foreign markets. A related point is that for a nation to negotiate, it is necessary that the gain from doing so be greater than the gain available from [[unilateralism|unilateral]] liberalization; reciprocal concessions intend to ensure that such gains will materialize.<ref name=\"H43\">B. Hoekman, ''The WTO: Functions and Basic Principles'', 43</ref>\n# '''Binding and enforceable commitments'''. The [[tariff]] commitments made by WTO members in multilateral trade negotiation and on accession are enumerated in a [[legal instrument]] known as a schedule (list) of concessions.<ref>WTO, [https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/schedules_e/goods_schedules_e.htm Schedules of concessions], accessed 10 January 2022</ref> These schedules establish \"ceiling bindings\": a country can change its bindings, but only after negotiating with its trading partners, which could mean compensating them for loss of trade. If satisfaction is not obtained, the complaining country may invoke the WTO dispute settlement procedures.<ref name=\"PT\"/><ref name=\"H43\"/>\n# '''Transparency'''. The WTO members are required to publish their trade regulations, to maintain institutions allowing for the review of administrative decisions affecting trade, to respond to requests for information by other members, and to notify changes in trade policies to the WTO. These internal transparency requirements are supplemented and facilitated by periodic country-specific reports (trade policy reviews) through the [[Trade Policy Review Mechanism]] (TPRM).<ref name=\" H44\">B. Hoekman, ''The WTO: Functions and Basic Principles'', 44</ref> The WTO system tries also to improve predictability and stability, discouraging the use of [[Import quota|quotas]] and other measures used to set limits on quantities of imports.<ref name=\"PT\"/>\n# '''Safety values'''. In specific circumstances, governments are able to [[Trade restriction|restrict trade]]. The WTO's agreements permit members to take measures to protect not only the environment but also public health, animal health and plant health.<ref name=\"wto.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/what_stand_for_e.htm|title=WTO \u2013 What is the WTO? \u2013 What we stand for|website=www.wto.org|access-date=28 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606054009/https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/what_stand_for_e.htm|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\nThere are three types of provision in this direction:\n# articles allowing for the use of trade measures to attain non-economic objectives;\n# articles aimed at ensuring \"fair competition\"; members must not use environmental protection measures as a means of disguising protectionist policies.<ref name=\"wto.org\"/><ref>Farah, Paolo Davide and Cima, Elena, World Trade Organization, Renewable Energy Subsidies and the Case of Feed-In Tariffs: Time for Reform Toward Sustainable Development?

Also, there are results of research that show that new countries actively reduce trade barriers only after becoming significantly rich. From the results of the study, WTO critics argue that trade liberalization does not guarantee economic growth and certainly not poverty alleviation.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nCritics also put forward the view that the benefits derived from WTO facilitated free trade are not shared equally.<ref name=\"Polity\"/> This criticism is usually supported by historical accounts of the outcomes of negotiations and/or data showing that the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, especially in [[China]] and [[India]], where economic inequality was growing at the time even though economic growth is very high.<ref name=\":7\" /> In addition, WTO approaches aiming to reduce trade barriers can harm developing countries. Trade liberalization that is too early without any prominent domestic barriers is feared to trap the developing economies in the primary sector, which often does not require skilled labor. And when these developing countries decide to advance their economy utilizing industrialization, the premature domestic industry cannot immediately skyrocket as expected, making it difficult to compete with other countries whose industries are more advanced.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last1=Joseph|first1=Sarah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-U_1KMg6GkgC|title=Blame it on the WTO?: A Human Rights Critique|last2=Joseph|first2=Sarah Louise|date=2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-956589-4|pages=171\u2013174|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\nStudies show that the WTO boosted trade.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Judith L.|last2=Rivers|first2=Douglas|last3=Tomz|first3=Michael|date=2007|title=Institutions in International Relations: Understanding the Effects of the GATT and the WTO on World Trade|journal=International Organization|language=en|volume=61|issue=1|pages=37\u201367|doi=10.1017/S0020818307070014|issn=1531-5088 |author-link1=Judith Goldstein (political scientist)|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last1=Tomz|first1=Michael|last2=Goldstein|first2=Judith L|last3=Rivers|first3=Douglas|date=2007|title=Do We Really Know That the WTO Increases Trade?
