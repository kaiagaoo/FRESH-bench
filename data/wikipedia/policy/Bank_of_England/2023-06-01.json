It also manages the country's [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[gold reserves]]. The bank also acts as the bankers' bank, especially in its capacity as a lender of last resort.\n\nThe bank has a monopoly on the issue of [[banknote]]s in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one-for-one with deposits at the bank, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845.

However, with the decision to grant the bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred in 1998 to the new [[Debt Management Office]], which also took over government cash management in 2000. [[Computershare]] took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds ([[gilt-edged security|gilt-edged securities]] or 'gilts') from the bank at the end of 2004.\n\nThe bank used to be responsible for the regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries. This responsibility was transferred to the [[Financial Services Authority]] in June 1998, but after the financial crises in 2008, new banking legislation transferred the responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries back to the bank.\n\nIn 2011 the interim [[Financial Policy Committee]] (FPC) was created as a mirror committee to the MPC to spearhead the bank's new mandate on financial stability. The FPC is responsible for macro-prudential regulation of all UK banks and insurance companies.\n\nTo help maintain economic stability, the bank attempts to broaden understanding of its role, both through regular speeches and publications by senior Bank figures, a semiannual Financial Stability Report,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211185350/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr|url-status=dead|title=Financial Stability Report|archivedate=11 February 2012}}</ref> and through a wider education strategy aimed at the general public.

Along with managing the QE funds, which were \u00a3895 bn at peak, the APF continues to operate its corporate facilities. Both are undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).<ref name=\"APF\"/>\n\nQE was primarily designed as an instrument of monetary policy. The mechanism required the Bank of England to purchase government bonds on the secondary market, financed by creating new [[Monetary base|central bank money]]. This would have the effect of increasing the asset prices of the bonds purchased, thereby lowering yields and dampening longer-term interest rates. The policy's aim was initially to ease liquidity constraints in the sterling reserves system but evolved into a wider policy to provide economic stimulus.\n\nQE was enacted in six tranches between 2009 and 2020. At its peak in 2020, the portfolio totalled \u00a3895 billion, comprising \u00a3875 billion of UK government bonds and \u00a320 billion of high-grade commercial bonds.\n\nIn February 2022, the Bank of England announced its intention to commence winding down the QE portfolio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/letter/2022/apf-letters-february-2022|title=Exchange of letters between the Governor and the Chancellor on the Asset Purchase Facility - February 2022|website=www.bankofengland.co.uk}}</ref> Initially this would be achieved by not replacing tranches of maturing bonds, and would later be accelerated through active bond sales.\n\nIn August 2022, the Bank of England reiterated its intention to accelerate the QE wind-down through active bond sales.

In addition, a total of \u00a31.1bn of corporate bonds matured, reducing the stock from \u00a320.0bn to \u00a318.9bn, with sales of the remaining stock planned to begin on 27 September.\n\n==Banknote issues==\n{{Main|Bank of England note issues}}\nThe bank has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were \"White Notes\", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries, White Notes were issued in \u00a31 and \u00a32 denominations. During the 20th century, White Notes were issued in denominations between \u00a35 and \u00a31000.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, commercial banks were allowed to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=\u00a32 note issued by Evans, Jones, Davies & Co |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118104053/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx |archive-date=18 January 2012 |access-date=31 October 2011 |publisher=British Museum |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Bank Charter Act 1844]] began the process of restricting note issue to the bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes, and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted to expand their issue. As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the bank with a monopoly of note issues in England and Wales.

Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible into gold through the bank; they replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable raw material purchases for armament production. These notes featured an image of [[George V|King George V]] (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was:\n\n{{Blockquote|UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND \u2013 Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount \u2013 Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo.

The original plan was to parachute the money into the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe. Although most fell into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterward, which led banknote denominations above \u00a35 to be removed from circulation.\n\nIn 2006, over \u00a353&nbsp;million in banknotes belonging to the bank was [[Securitas depot robbery|stolen from a depot]] in [[Tonbridge, Kent]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=27 February 2006 |title=Record \u00a353m stolen in depot raid |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4756454.stm |url-status=live |access-date=14 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302160829/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4756454.stm |archive-date=2 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nModern banknotes are printed by contract with [[De La Rue]] Currency in [[Loughton, Essex]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Banknote Production |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/pages/about/production.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310004155/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/production.aspx |archive-date=10 March 2012 |website=bankofengland.co.uk |publisher=Bank of England}}</ref>\n\n==Gold vault==\nThe bank is custodian to the official gold reserves of the United Kingdom and around 30 other countries.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Belton |first=P\u00e1draig |title=The city with $248 billion beneath its pavement |url=https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160419-the-city-with-248-billion-beneath-its-pavement |date=19 April 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108104509/https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160419-the-city-with-248-billion-beneath-its-pavement |archive-date=8 November 2020 |access-date=9 November 2020 |website=bbc.com |language=en}}</ref> {{As of|2016|04}}, the bank holds around {{Convert|5134|tonne}} of gold, worth \u00a3141&nbsp;billion.
