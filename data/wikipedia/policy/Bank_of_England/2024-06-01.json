North-west of the Pay Hall, overlooking St Christopher's churchyard to the south, Taylor built a suite of rooms for the Directors of the bank centred on a new (much larger) Court Room and Committee Room (When the bank was rebuilt in the 1920s-30s, these  rooms were removed from their original ground-floor location and reconstructed on the first floor; they continue to be used for meetings of the bank's Court of Directors and Monetary Policy Committee respectively.).<ref>{{cite web |title=Court Room |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bankofengland/6220545302 |website=Flickr |date=7 October 2011 |publisher=Bank of England |access-date=3 January 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Committee Room |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bankofengland/6220027309 |website=Flickr |date=7 October 2011 |publisher=Bank of England |access-date=10 January 2024}}</ref> East of the Pay Hall, Taylor built a suite of halls and offices dedicated to the management of stocks and dividends, which more or less doubled the size of the bank's footprint (extending it as far as Bartholomew Lane).<ref name=\"Kynaston2017\">{{cite book |last1=Kynaston |first1=David |title=Till Time's Last Sand: A History of the Bank of England 1694-2013 |date=2017 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |pages=60\u201362}}</ref> These rooms were centred on a large Rotunda, also known as the [[Stock exchange|Brokers' Exchange]], where dealing in Government Stock took place; around it were arranged four sizeable Transfer Offices, each corresponding with a different fund (as described in the 1820s: 'In each office under the several letters of the alphabet, are arranged the books on which the names of all persons having property in the funds are registered, as well as the particulars of their respective interests').<ref name=\"Allen1828\">{{cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Thomas |title=The History and Antiquities of London, Westminster, Southwark, and Parts Adjacent (Volume 3) |date=1828 |publisher=Cowie & Strange |location=London |pages=221\u2013245}}</ref> All these offices were top-lit, to avoid the need for windows in the external walls. \n\n[[File:A view of the Bank of England, Threadneedle Street, London (NYPL Hades-280166-1253467).tiff|thumb|right|The bank in 1797: matching east and west wings by Sir Robert Taylor flank Sampson's centrepiece of 1733.]]\nIn 1782 the church of St Christopher le Stocks was demolished, allowing the bank to expand westwards along Threadneedle Street. The new west wing was completed to Taylor's design in 1786 (its frontage matching that of Taylor's earlier east wing): it housed the Reduced Annuities Office, the Cheque Office and the Dividend Warrant Office (among others). Immediately to the north lay the former churchyard of St Christopher le Stocks, which was preserved within the complex of buildings as a garden (known as the 'Garden Court'). North of Bullion Court, Taylor built a new four-storey Library, to house the bank's expanding collection of archives. \n\n====The Bank Picquet====\nThe church's demolition had been prompted by the 1780 [[Gordon Riots]], during which rioters reportedly climbed on the church to throw projectiles at the buildings of the bank. During the riots, in June 1780, the Lord Mayor of London petitioned the Secretary of State to send a military guard to protect the bank and the Mansion House.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bank Picquet: its function and history |date=1963 |publisher=Bank of England |location=London |url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/archive/publications/bank-picquet.pdf |access-date=4 January 2024}}</ref> Thenceforward a nightly guard (the '[[Bank Picquet]]') was provided by soldiers of the [[Household Brigade]] (a practice which continued until 1973).

Under his direction, the bank was further expanded and partially rebuilt, bit by bit but to a cohesive plan. A survey of the buildings, undertaken at the start of his tenure, identified some problems, which were promptly remedied by Soane: for example in 1795 he rebuilt the Rotunda and two of the adjacent Transfer Offices (the Bank Stock Office and the Four Per Cent Office), replacing Taylor's timber roofs, which were leaking, with more durable stonework.<ref name=\"Francis1848\" /> At the same time Soane was tasked with purchasing properties to the north-east, so as to enable the bank to expand in that direction as far as Lothbury.
