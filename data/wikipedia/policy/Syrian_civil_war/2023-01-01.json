The [[Syrian Armed Forces]] and its domestic and international allies represent the [[Syrian Arab Republic]] and the Assad regime. Opposed to it is the [[Syrian Interim Government]], a loose alliance of [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]-led [[Syrian Opposition|opposition]] groups (whose defense forces consist of the [[Syrian National Army]] and the [[Free Syrian Army]]). Another faction is the [[Syrian Salvation Government]], a coalition of [[Sunni Islamism|Sunni Islamist]] rebel groups headed by [[Tahrir al-Sham]]. Independent of all of them is the [[De facto|de-facto]] [[autonomous territory]] of Rojava, whose armed wing is the mixed Kurdish-Arab [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF). Other competing factions include [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi Jihadist]] organisations such as the Al-Qaeda-affiliated [[Al-Nusra Front]] and the [[Islamic State]] (ISIS/ISIL).

The [[Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Operation Inherent Resolve|U.S.-led international coalition]], established in 2014 with the declared purpose of countering ISIL, has [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War|conducted airstrikes]] primarily against ISIL as well as some [[List of United States attacks on Syria during the Syrian civil war|against government and pro-government targets]]. They have also deployed special forces and artillery units to engage ISIL on the ground. Since 2015, the U.S. has supported the [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria]] and its armed wing, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), materially, financially, and logistically. Turkish forces have fought the SDF, ISIL, and the Syrian government since 2016, but have also actively supported the [[Syrian opposition]] and currently [[Turkish occupation of northern Syria|occupy large swaths of northwestern Syria]] while engaging in significant ground combat.

The [[Syrian Constitution of 1973|1973 Constitution]] entrusted [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Arab Socialist Baath party]] with the distinctive role as the \"leader of the state and society\"; empowering it to mobilise the civilians for party programmes, issue decrees to ascertain their loyalty and supervise all legal trade unions. [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist]] ideology was imposed upon children as compulsory part of school curriculum and [[Syrian Armed Forces]] were tightly controlled to the Party. The constitution removed Islam from being recognised as the [[state religion]] and stripped existing provisions such as the [[president of Syria]] being required to be a [[Muslim]]. These measures caused widespread furore amongst the public; leading to fierce demonstrations in [[Hama]], [[Homs]] and [[Aleppo]] organized by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and the ''ulama''.

Eventually the party organisation itself became a rubberstamp and the power structures became deeply dependent on sectarian affiliation to the Assad family and the central role of [[Syrian Armed Forces|armed forces]] needed to crack down on dissent in the society. Critics of the regime have pointed out that deployment of violence is at the crux of [[Ba'athist Syria]] and describe it as \"a dictatorship with genocidal tendencies\".
