Reversing a lower court decision, Sotomayor found that the ''[[Bivens v.

A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land should be used for a redevelopment project.

The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]'' ruling.

North Carolina]]'', in which the Supreme Court held that age is relevant when determining when a person is in police [[Custodial interrogation|custody]] for ''[[Miranda warning|Miranda]]'' purposes. J.D.B. was a 13-year-old student enrolled in [[special education]] classes whom police had suspected of committing two robberies. A police investigator visited J.D.B. at school, where he was interrogated by the investigator, a uniformed police officer, and school officials. J.D.B. subsequently confessed to his crimes and was convicted. J.D.B. was not given a ''Miranda'' warning during the interrogation, nor an opportunity to contact his [[Legal guardian#United States|legal guardian]]. In determining that a child's age properly informs the ''Miranda'' custody analysis, Sotomayor wrote that \"to hold... that a child's age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody\u2014 and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults\u2014would be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that ''Miranda'' guarantees to adults\".<ref name=opinion>''[[J.D.B. v.

California'' (holding that a child's age \"would have affected how a reasonable person\" would \"perceive his or her freedom to leave\") and ''[[Yarborough v. Alvarado]]'' (holding that a child's age \"generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception\"). Sotomayor also pointed out that the law recognizes that a child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (''e.g.'', limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent). [[Associate Justice]] Samuel Alito, jointed by three other justices, wrote a [[dissenting opinion]].\n\n====Stolen Valor Act====\n\nIn ''[[United States v. Alvarez]]'' (2012), the Court struck down the [[Stolen Valor Act]] (a federal law that criminalized false statements about having received a military medal) on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds. While a 6\u20133 majority of the Court agreed that the law was an unconstitutional violation of the [[Free Speech Clause]], it could not agree on a single rationale. Sotomayor was among four justices, along with Justices Roberts, Ginsburg and Kennedy, who concluded that a statement's falsity is not enough, by itself, to exclude speech from First Amendment protection. Justices Breyer and Kagan concluded that while false statements were entitled to some protection, the act was invalid because it could have achieved its objectives in less restrictive ways. Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito dissented.<ref>Tushnet, ''In the Balance'', pp. 216\u2013217.</ref>\n\n====Affordable Care Act====\n\nIn ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'' (2012), Sotomayor was part of a 5\u20134 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's [[Taxing and Spending Clause]] rather than [[Commerce Clause]] in arriving at the support). Legal writer [[Jeffrey Toobin]] wrote, \"Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions about the facts of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of applying the same principle to health insurance as well).\"<ref name=\"toobin-280\">Toobin, ''The Oath'', p. 280.</ref> Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: \"Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?\" For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.<ref name=\"toobin-280\"/>\n\nIn 2014, Sotomayor dissented from a 6&ndash;3 ruling that granted [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] of Illinois, a religiously affiliated university, an exemption from complying with the Affordable Care Act (ACA)'s [[Contraceptive mandate (United States)|mandate on contraception]].<ref name=\"July 7, 2014\">{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/7/7/5873611/the-supreme-courts-other-contraceptives-ruling-explained |title=The Supreme Court sided against birth control again, and Sotomayor is not happy about it |first=Adrianna |last=McIntyre |date=July 7, 2014 | access-date=June 13, 2017 | archive-date=February 18, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218085453/http://www.vox.com/2014/7/7/5873611/the-supreme-courts-other-contraceptives-ruling-explained | url-status=live}}</ref> The ruling, which came the immediate wake of the Court's 5\u20134 decision in ''[[Burwell v.

Writing in dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the case was at odds with the majority's previous statements in ''Hobby Lobby'' and said,  \"Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ...
