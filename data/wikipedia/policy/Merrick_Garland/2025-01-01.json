He previously served as a [[United States federal judge|circuit judge]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] from 1997 to 2021. In 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] [[Merrick_Garland_Supreme_Court_nomination|nominated]] Garland to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], but the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-led [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] refused to hold a vote to confirm him.\n\nA native of the [[Chicago area]], Garland attended [[Harvard University]] and [[Harvard Law School]], where he was an editor of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. He served as a [[law clerk]] to Judge [[Henry Friendly]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] and to [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[William J. Brennan Jr.]], and then practiced corporate litigation at [[Arnold & Porter]], after which he worked as a federal prosecutor in the [[United States Department of Justice]], where he supervised the investigation and prosecution of the [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City bombers]]. President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Garland to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1997, and he served as its chief judge from 2013 to 2020.\n\nPresident [[Barack Obama]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] Garland to serve as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|associate justice of the Supreme Court]] in March 2016 to fill the vacancy created by the death of [[Antonin Scalia]]. However, the [[Senate Republican Conference|Republican Senate]] [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|majority]] refused to hold a hearing or vote on his nomination. The unprecedented refusal of a [[United States Senate|Senate]] majority to consider a Supreme Court nomination was highly controversial.<!--CITATIONS FOR THIS SENTENCE ARE PROVIDED IN THE BODY OF THE ARTICLE PER [[WP:LEADCITE]], SPECIFICALLY THE ADAM LIPTAK ARTICLE ENTITLED \"STUDY CALLS SNUB OF OBAMA'S SUPREME COURT PICK UNPRECEDENTED,\" WHICH SUMMARIES THE STUDY BY ROBIN BRADLEY KAR AND JASON MAZZONE PUBLISHED IN THE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2752287). DO NOT REMOVE OR MODIFY THIS SENTENCE WITHOUT OBTAINING CONSENSUS ON THE TALK PAGE.--> Garland's nomination lasted 293 days (the longest to date), and it expired on January 3, 2017, at the end of the [[114th Congress]]. Eventually, President [[Donald Trump]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], nominated [[Neil Gorsuch]] to the vacant seat, and the Republican Senate majority confirmed him.\n\nPresident [[Joe Biden]] nominated Garland as U.S. attorney general in January 2021. He was confirmed by the Senate in a 70\u201330 vote, and took office in March of that same year.\n\n==Early life and education==\nGarland was born on November 13, 1952, in [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LxFAQAAIAAJ |title=Biographical Directory of the Federal Judiciary |publisher=Bernan Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0890592588 |page=511 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102134130/https://books.google.com/books?id=2LxFAQAAIAAJ |archive-date=November 2, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>  His mother Shirley ({{n\u00e9e|Horwitz}}; 1925{{ndash}}2016)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2000-11-27-0011270039-story.html |access-date=September 11, 2021 |title=Garland (obituary) |date=November 27, 2000 |work=Chicago Tribune |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222171812/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-11-27/news/0011270039_1_weinstein-chapel-service-roter |archive-date=February 22, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> was a director of volunteer services at [[CJE SeniorLife|Chicago's Council for Jewish Elderly]] (now called CJE SeniorLife).
