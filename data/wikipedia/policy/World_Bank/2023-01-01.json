It was established along with the [[International Monetary Fund]] at the 1944 [[Bretton Woods Conference]]. After a slow start, its first loan was to France in 1947. In the 1970s, it focused on loans to developing world countries, shifting away from that mission in the 1980s. For the last 30 years, it has included NGOs and environmental groups in its loan portfolio. Its loan strategy is influenced by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] as well as environmental and social safeguards. \n\n{{As of|2022}}, the World Bank is run by a president and 25 executive directors, as well as 29 various vice presidents. IBRD and IDA have 189 and 174 member countries, respectively. The U.S., Japan, China, Germany and the U.K. have the most voting power. The bank aims loans at developing countries to help reduce poverty. The bank is engaged in several global partnerships and initiatives, and takes a role in working toward addressing climate change. The World Bank operates a number of training wings and it works with the Clean Air Initiative and the UN Development Business. It works within the Open Data Initiative and hosts an Open Knowledge Repository. \n\nThe World Bank has been criticized as promoting inflation and harming economic development, causing protests in [[1988 IMF/World Bank protests|1988]] and [[Washington A16, 2000|2000]]. There has also been criticism of the bank's governance and response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].\n\n==World Bank Group==\nThe [[World Bank Group]] is an extended family of five international organizations, and the parent organization of the World Bank, the collective name given to the first two listed organizations, the IBRD and the IDA:\n\n*[[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD)\n*[[International Development Association]] (IDA)\n*[[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC)\n*[[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency]] (MIGA)\n*[[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID)\n\n==History==\n[[File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harry Dexter White]] (left) and [[John Maynard Keynes]], the \"founding fathers\" of both the World Bank and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)<ref name=\"Bretton Woods Founding Fathers 2004\">{{cite web |title=The Founding Fathers |publisher=International Monetary Fund |url=http://jolis.worldbankimflib.org/Bwf/60panel3.htm |access-date=11 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822023626/http://jolis.worldbankimflib.org/Bwf/60panel3.htm |archive-date=22 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>]]\n\nThe World Bank was created at the 1944 [[Bretton Woods Conference]], along with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).

When the [[Marshall Plan]] went into effect in 1947, many European countries began receiving aid from other sources. Faced with this competition, the World Bank shifted its focus to non-European allies. Until 1968, its loans were [[Earmark (finance)|earmark]]ed for the construction of infrastructure works, such as seaports, highway systems, and power plants, that would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan. In 1960, the [[International Development Association]] was formed (as opposed to a UN fund named SUNFED), providing soft loans to developing countries.\n\nBefore 1974, the reconstruction and development loans the World Bank made were relatively small. Its staff was aware of the need to instill confidence in the bank. [[Fiscal conservatism]] ruled, and loan applications had to meet strict criteria.<ref name=\"Goldman 2005\" />{{rp|56\u201360}}\n\nThe first country to receive a World Bank loan was France in 1947. The Bank's president at the time, [[John J. McCloy|John McCloy]], chose France over two other applicants, Poland and Chile. The loan was for US$250&nbsp;million, half the amount requested, and came with strict conditions. France had to agree to produce a balanced budget and give priority of debt repayment to the World Bank over other governments. World Bank staff closely monitored the use of the funds to ensure that the French government met the conditions. In addition, before the loan was approved, the [[United States State Department]] told the French government that its members associated with the Communist Party would first have to be removed. The French government complied and removed the [[Communist Party of France|Communist]] [[coalition government]]\u2014the so-called [[Tripartite system (politics)|tripartite]]. Within hours, the loan to France was approved.<ref name=\"Bird 1992\">{{cite book |title=The Chairman: John J.

Krueger was known for her criticism of development funding and for describing [[Third World]] governments as \"[[rent-seeking]] states\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, the bank emphasized lending to service Third-World debt, and [[structural adjustment]] policies designed to streamline the economies of developing nations.

Since then, in accordance with its so-called \"Six Strategic Themes\", the bank has put various additional policies into effect to preserve the environment while promoting development. For example, in 1991, the bank announced that to protect against deforestation, especially in the Amazon, it would not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm the environment.\n\nIn order to promote global public goods, the World Bank tries to control communicable diseases such as malaria, delivering vaccines to several parts of the world, and joining combat forces.

Although results vary widely within regions and countries, the trend indicates that the world as a whole can meet the goal of halving the percentage of people living in poverty. Africa's poverty, however, is expected to rise, and most of the 36 countries where 90% of the world's undernourished children live are in Africa. Less than a quarter of countries are on track for achieving the goal of halving under-nutrition.\n# '''Achieve Universal Primary Education''': The percentage of children in school in developing countries increased from 80% in 1991 to 88% in 2005. Still, about 72&nbsp;million children of primary school age, 57% of them girls, were not being educated {{as of|2005|lc=y}}.\n# '''Promote Gender Equality''': The tide is turning slowly for women in the labor market, yet far more women than men\u2014worldwide more than 60%\u2014are contributing but unpaid family workers. The World Bank Group Gender Action Plan was created to advance women's economic empowerment and promote shared growth.\n# '''Reduce Child Mortality''': There is some improvement in survival rates globally; accelerated improvements are needed most urgently in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 10 million-plus children under five died in 2005; most of their deaths were from preventable causes.\n# '''Improve Maternal Health''': Almost all of the half-million women who die during pregnancy or childbirth every year live in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. There are numerous causes of maternal death that require a variety of health care interventions to be made widely accessible.\n# '''Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases''': Annual numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS deaths have fallen, but the number of people living with HIV continues to grow. In the eight worst-hit southern African countries, prevalence is above 15 percent. Treatment has increased globally, but still meets only 30 percent of needs (with wide variations across countries). AIDS remains the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa (1.6&nbsp;million deaths in 2007). There are 300 to 500&nbsp;million cases of malaria each year, leading to more than 1&nbsp;million deaths. Nearly all the cases and more than 95 percent of the deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n# '''Ensure Environmental Sustainability''': Deforestation remains a critical problem, particularly in regions of biological diversity, which continues to decline. Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing faster than energy technology advancement.\n# '''Develop a Global Partnership for Development''': Donor countries have renewed their commitment. Donors have to fulfill their pledges to match the current rate of core program development. Emphasis is being placed on the Bank Group's collaboration with multilateral and local partners to quicken progress toward the MDGs' realization.\n\n=== Environmental and Social Safeguards ===\nTo ensure that World Bank-financed operations do not compromise these goals but instead add to their realisation, the following environmental, social, and legal safeguards were defined: Environmental Assessment, Indigenous Peoples, Involuntary Resettlement, Physical Cultural Resources, Forests, Natural Habitats, Pest Management, Safety of Dams, Projects in Disputed Areas, Projects on International Waterways, and Performance Standards for Private Sector Activities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Environmental and Social Policies |author=The World Bank |publisher= World Bank Group |url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/environmental-and-social-policies#safeguards|access-date = 4 December 2020}}</ref>\n\nAt the World Bank's 2012 annual meeting in Tokyo, a review of these safeguards was initiated, which was welcomed by several civil society organisations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Most relevant review |author=Korinna Horta |publisher=dandc.eu |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/world-bank-reviewing-its-social-and-environmental-safeguards-and-civil-society-organisations}}</ref> As a result, the World Bank developed a new Environmental and Social Framework, which has been in implementation since 1 October 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=Environmental and Social Framework |author=The World Bank |publisher= World Bank Group |date=October 2018 |url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/environmental-and-social-framework}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\nThe President of the Bank is the president of the entire [[World Bank Group]].

It aimed to inspire change agents and prepare them with essential tools that can help achieve development results. \nWBI had four major strategies to approach development problems: innovation for development, knowledge exchange, leadership and coalition building, and structured learning. World Bank Institute (WBI) was formerly known as Economic Development Institute (EDI), established on 11 March 1955 with the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. The purpose of the institute was to provide an open place where senior officials from developing countries could discuss development policies and programs. Over the years, EDI grew significantly and in 2000, the institute was renamed as the World Bank Institute. Sanjay Pradhan is the past Vice President of the World Bank Institute.<ref name=\"World Bank Institute About 2012\">{{cite web | title = About WBI | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank Institute | url = http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/about | access-date = 31 May 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120529155048/http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/about | archive-date = 29 May 2012 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> As of 2019, World Bank Institute functions have been mostly encapsulated by a new unit Global Operations Knowledge Management Unit (GOKMU), which is now responsible for knowledge management and learning across the Bank.\n\n===Global Development Learning Network===\nThe Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) is a partnership of over 120 learning centers (GDLN Affiliates) in nearly 80 countries around the world. GDLN Affiliates collaborate in holding events that connect people across countries and regions for learning and dialogue on development issues.\n\nGDLN clients are typically NGOs, government, private sector, and development agencies who find that they work better together on subregional, regional, or global development issues using the facilities and tools offered by GDLN Affiliates. Clients also benefit from the ability of Affiliates to help them choose and apply these tools effectively and to tap development practitioners and experts worldwide. GDLN Affiliates facilitate around 1000 video conference-based activities a year on behalf of their clients, reaching some 90,000 people worldwide. Most of these activities bring together participants in two or more countries over a series of sessions. A majority of GDLN activities are organized by small government agencies and NGOs.\n\n====GDLN Asia Pacific====\nThe GDLN in the East Asia and Pacific region has experienced rapid growth and Distance Learning Centers now operate or are planned in 20 countries: Australia, Mongolia, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Japan, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, Thailand, Laos, Timor Leste, Fiji, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and New Zealand. With over 180 Distance Learning Centers, it is the largest development learning network in the Asia and Pacific region. The Secretariat Office of GDLN Asia Pacific is located in the Center of Academic Resources of Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nGDLN Asia Pacific was launched at the GDLN's East Asia and Pacific regional meeting held in Bangkok from 22 to 24 May 2006. Its vision is to become \"the premier network exchanging ideas, experience and know-how across the Asia Pacific Region\". GDLN Asia Pacific is a separate entity to The World Bank. It has endorsed its own Charter and Business Plan and, in accordance with the Charter, a GDLN Asia Pacific Governing Committee has been appointed.\n\nThe committee comprises China (2), Australia (1), Thailand (1), The World Bank (1), and finally, a nominee of the Government of Japan (1). The organization is currently hosted by Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, a founding member of the GDLN Asia Pacific.\n\nThe Governing Committee has determined that the most appropriate legal status for the GDLN AP in Thailand is a \"Foundation\". The World Bank is engaging a solicitor in Thailand to process all documentation in order to obtain this status.\n\nGDLN Asia Pacific is built on the principle of shared resources among partners engaged in a common task, and this is visible in the organizational structures that exist, as the network evolves. Physical space for its headquarters is provided by the host of the GDLN Centre in Thailand \u2013 Chulalongkorn University; Technical expertise and some infrastructure is provided by the Tokyo Development Learning Centre (TDLC); Fiduciary services are provided by Australian National University (ANU) Until the GDLN Asia Pacific is established as a legal entity in Thailand, ANU, has offered to assist the governing committee, by providing a means of managing the inflow and outflow of funds and of reporting on them. This admittedly results in some complexity in contracting arrangements, which need to be worked out on a case-by-case basis and depends to some extent on the legal requirements of the countries involved.\n\n===JUSTPAL Network===\nA Justice Sector Peer-Assisted Learning (JUSTPAL) Network was launched in April 2011 by the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) Department of the World Bank's Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region. JUSTPAL's objective is to provide an online and offline platform for justice professionals to exchange knowledge, good practices, and peer-driven improvements to justice systems and thereby support countries to improve their justice sector performance, quality of justice, and service delivery to citizens and businesses.\n\nThe JUSTPAL Network includes representatives of judiciaries, ministries of justice, prosecutors, anti-corruption agencies, and other justice-related entities from across the globe. It has active members from more than 50 countries.\n\nTo facilitate fruitful exchange of reform experiences and sharing of applicable good practices, JUSTPAL has organized its activities under five Communities of Practice (COPs): Budgeting for the Justice Sector; Information Systems for Justice Services; Justice Sector Physical Infrastructure; Court Management and Administration; and Prosecution and Anti-Corruption Agencies.\n\n==Country assistance strategies==\nAs a guideline to the World Bank's operations in any particular country, a Country Assistance Strategy is produced in cooperation with the local government and any interested stakeholders and may rely on analytical work performed by the Bank or other parties.\n\n==Multi-Donor Trust Fund==\nAnother programme is the Multi-Donor Trust Fund.<ref name=\"mdtfu\">{{cite news |title=World Bank Announces Additional $1.49 Billion Financing Support for Ukraine |url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/06/07/-world-bank-announces-additional-1-49-billion-financing-support-for-ukraine |publisher=The World Bank Group |date=7 June 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Clean Air Initiative==\nClean Air Initiative (CAI) is a World Bank initiative to advance innovative ways to improve air quality in cities through partnerships in selected regions of the world by sharing knowledge and experiences.

Instead, the projects often serve to expand the exercise of bureaucratic state power. His case studies of development projects in [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] show that the World Bank's characterization of the economic conditions in [[Lesotho]] was flawed, and the Bank ignored the political and cultural character of the state in crafting its projects.

Some of these policies included encouraging [[production (economics)|production]], investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real [[exchange rates]], and altering the distribution of government resources. Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], economic growth regressed and inflation worsened.\n\nBy the late 1980s, some international organizations began to believe that structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world's poor, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans, allowing for social spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises.<ref name=\"deVries 1996\" />{{rp|70}} In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans.<ref name=\"Tan 2007\">{{Cite encyclopedia | title = The poverty of amnesia: PRSPs in the legacy of structural adjustment | author = Tan, Celine | encyclopedia = The World Bank and Governance: A Decade of Reform and Reaction | editor = Stone, Diane | editor2 = Wright, Christopher | year = 2007 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-41282-7}}</ref>{{rp|147}}\n\n===Fairness of assistance conditions===\nSome critics,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/sites/default/files/treacherousconditions07052003.pdf | title=Treacherous conditions: How IMF and World Bank policies tied to debt relief are undermining development | publisher=World Development Movement | year=2003 | access-date=12 May 2013 | author=Hardstaff, Peter | archive-date=29 March 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329034727/http://www.wdm.org.uk/sites/default/files/treacherousconditions07052003.pdf | url-status=dead }}</ref> most prominently the author [[Naomi Klein]], are of the opinion that the World Bank Group's loans and aid have unfair conditions attached to them that reflect the interests, financial power and political doctrines (notably the [[Washington Consensus]]) of the Bank and, by extension, the countries that are most influential within it.
