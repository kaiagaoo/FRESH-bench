At its core, Section 230(c)(1) provides immunity from liability for providers and users of an \"interactive computer service\" who publish information provided by third-party users:\n<blockquote>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.</blockquote>\n\nSection 230(c)(2) further provides \"[[Good Samaritan]]\" protection from civil liability for operators of interactive computer services in the good faith removal or moderation of third-party material they deem \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.\"\n\nSection 230 was developed in response to a pair of lawsuits against online discussion platforms in the early 1990s that resulted in different interpretations of whether the service providers should be treated as publishers or, alternatively, as distributors of content created by their users. Its authors, Representatives [[Christopher Cox]] and [[Ron Wyden]], believed interactive computer services should be treated as distributors, not liable for the content they distributed, as a means to protect the growing Internet at the time.\n\nSection 230 was enacted as part of the [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA) of 1996 (a common name for Title V of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]]), formally codified as part of the [[Communications Act of 1934]] at {{usc|47|230}}.{{efn|Section 230 is commonly mislabeled as \"Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\" It was the ninth section of the Communications Decency Act, and the 509th section of the Telecommunications Act of 1996; formally, Section 230 is an amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 codified as Section 230 of Title 47 of the U.S. Code.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/LSB10306.pdf | title = Liability for Content Hosts: An Overview of the Communication Decency Act's Section 230 | publisher = [[Congressional Research Service]] | first = Valerie C. | last = Brannon | date = June 6, 2019 | access-date = September 5, 2020 | archive-date = January 11, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210111104741/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/LSB10306.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref>}} After passage of the Telecommunications Act, the CDA was challenged in courts and was ruled by the Supreme Court in ''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union]]'' (1997) to be unconstitutional, though Section 230 was determined to be [[Severability|severable]] from the rest of the legislation and remained in place. Since then, several legal challenges have validated the constitutionality of Section 230.\n\nSection 230 protections are not limitless and require providers to remove material illegal on a federal level, such as in [[copyright infringement]] cases. In 2018, Section 230 was amended by the [[Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act]] (FOSTA-SESTA) to require the removal of material violating federal and state sex trafficking laws. In the following years, protections from Section 230 have come under more scrutiny on issues related to [[hate speech]] and [[framing (social sciences)|ideological biases]] in relation to the power that technology companies can hold on political discussions and became a major issue during the [[2020 United States presidential election]], especially with regard to alleged censorship of more conservative viewpoints on social media.\n\nPassed when Internet use was just starting to expand in both breadth of services and range of consumers in the United States,<ref name=\"zdnet book\">{{Cite web|last=Grossman|first=Wendy M.|title=The Twenty-Six Words that Created the Internet, book review: The biography of a law|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-book-review-the-biography-of-a-law/|access-date=2020-09-04|website=ZDNet|language=en|archive-date=January 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210112114203/https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-book-review-the-biography-of-a-law/|url-status=live}}</ref> Section 230 has frequently been referred to as a key law, which allowed the Internet to develop.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Trump's Executive Order: What to Know About Section 230|url=https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/trumps-executive-order-what-know-about-section-230|access-date=2020-09-04|website=Council on Foreign Relations|language=en|archive-date=November 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120013118/https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/trumps-executive-order-what-know-about-section-230|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Application and limits==\nSection 230 has two primary parts both listed under \u00a7230(c) as the \"[[Good Samaritan]]\" portion of the law. Under section 230(c)(1), as identified above, an information service provider shall not be treated as a \"publisher or speaker\" of information from another provider. Section 230(c)(2) provides immunity from [[Legal liability|civil liabilities]] for information service providers that remove or restrict content from their services they deem \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected\", as long as they act \"in good faith\" in this action.\n\nIn analyzing the availability of the immunity offered by Section 230, courts generally apply a three-prong test. A defendant must satisfy each of the three prongs to gain the benefit of the immunity:<ref>{{cite web | url = https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/LSB10082.pdf | title = How Broad A Shield?

While this helped to expand the use of the Internet, it also resulted in a number of legal cases putting service providers at fault for the content generated by its users. This concern was raised by legal challenges against [[CompuServe]] and [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]], which were early service providers at that time.<ref name=\"verge cda230 062019\">{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700605/section-230-internet-law-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-jeff-kosseff-interview | title = Why The Internet's Most Important Law Exists And How People Are Still Getting It Wrong | first = Adi | last = Robertson | date = June 21, 2019 | access-date = June 21, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] | archive-date = February 26, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210226163950/https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700605/section-230-internet-law-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-jeff-kosseff-interview | url-status = live }}</ref> CompuServe stated it would not attempt to regulate what users posted on its services, while Prodigy had employed a team of moderators to validate content. Both companies faced legal challenges related to content posted by their users. In ''[[Cubby, Inc. v.

The new provision was added to the text of the proposed statute while the CDA was in conference within the House.\n\nThe overall Telecommunications Act, with both Exon's CDA and Cox/Wyden's provision, passed both Houses by near-unanimous votes and was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] by February 1996.<ref>{{USPL|104|104}}</ref> Cox/Wyden's section became Section 509 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and became law as a new Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934.

The court found for AOL and upheld the constitutionality of Section 230, stating that Section 230 \"creates a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a third-party user of the service.\"<ref>129 F.3d 330.</ref> The court asserted in its ruling Congress's rationale for Section 230 was to give Internet service providers broad immunity \"to remove disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to restrict their children's access to objectionable or inappropriate online material.\"<ref name=zeranVSaol /> In addition, ''Zeran'' notes \"the amount of information communicated via interactive computer services is ... staggering. The specter of tort liability in an area of such prolific speech would have an obviously chilling effect. It would be impossible for service providers to screen each of their millions of postings for possible problems. Faced with potential liability for each message republished by their services, interactive computer service providers might choose to severely restrict the number and type of messages posted. Congress considered the weight of the speech interests implicated and chose to immunize service providers to avoid any such restrictive effect.\"<ref name=zeranVSaol />\n\nThis rule, cementing Section 230's liability protections, has been considered one of the most important case laws affecting the growth of the Internet, allowing websites to be able to incorporate user-generated content without fear of prosecution.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/19/6044679/the-six-lawsuits-that-shaped-the-internet | title = These six lawsuits shaped the internet | first = Matt | last = Shroud | date = August 19, 2014 | access-date = July 2, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] | archive-date = February 8, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210208062737/https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/19/6044679/the-six-lawsuits-that-shaped-the-internet | url-status = live }}</ref> However, at the same time, this has led to Section 230 being used as a shield for some website owners as courts have ruled Section 230 provides complete immunity for ISPs with regard to the [[tort]]s committed by their users over their systems.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Power Without Responsibility: Intermediaries and the First Amendment | first = Rebecca | last = Tushnet | date = August 28, 2008 | access-date = July 1, 2019 | journal = [[The Georgetown Law Journal]] | volume = 76 | pages = 101\u2013131 | url = https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/fwps_papers/76/ | archive-date = February 25, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210225041726/https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/fwps_papers/76/ | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name=\"kosseff erosion\"/> Through the next decade, most cases involving Section 230 challenges generally fell in favor of service providers, ruling in favor of their immunity from third-party content on their sites.<ref name=\"kosseff erosion\"/>\n\n===Erosion of Section 230 immunity{{snd}}''Roommates.com'' (2008\u201316)===\nWhile Section 230 had seemed to have given near complete immunity to service providers in its first decade, new case law around 2008 started to find cases where providers can be liable for user content due to being a \"publisher or speaker\" related to that content under \u00a7230(c)(1).

In both the Christchurch and El Paso shootings, the perpetrator posted hate speech manifestos to [[8chan]], a moderated [[imageboard]] known to be favorable for the posting of extreme views. Concerned politicians and citizens raised calls at large tech companies for the need for hate speech to be removed from the Internet; however, hate speech is generally protected speech under the First Amendment, and Section 230 removes the liability for these tech companies to moderate such content as long as it is not illegal. This has given the appearance that tech companies do not need to be proactive against hateful content, thus allowing the hate content to proliferate online and lead to such incidents.<ref name=\"nytimes 230 hate\">{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html | title = Legal Shield for Websites Rattles Under Onslaught of Hate Speech | first = Daisuke | last = Wakabayashi | date = August 6, 2019 | access-date = August 12, 2019 | work = [[The New York Times]] | archive-date = February 8, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210208195335/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name=\"bloomberg aug19\"/>\n\nNotable articles on these concerns were published after the El Paso shooting by ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref name=\"nytimes 230 hate\"/> ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-let-google-get-away-with-censorship-11565132175 | title = Don't Let Google Get Away With Censorship | first = Dennis | last = Prager | date = August 6, 2019 | access-date = August 12, 2019 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | archive-date = January 15, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210115222252/https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-let-google-get-away-with-censorship-11565132175 | url-status = live }}</ref> and ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'',<ref name=\"bloomberg aug19\"/> among other outlets, but which were criticized by legal experts including [[Mike Godwin]], [[Mark Lemley]], and [[David Kaye (law professor)|David Kaye]], as the articles implied that hate speech was protected by Section 230, when it is in fact protected by the First Amendment.

The provisions provided by Italy are substantially in line with those provided at the EU level. However, at the beginning, the Italian case-law had drawn a line between so-called \"active\" hosting providers and \"passive\" Internet Service Providers, arguing that \"active\" Internet Service Providers would not benefit from the liability exception provided by Legislative Decree no. 70. According to that case-law, an ISP is deemed to be active whenever it carries out operations on the content provided by the user, such as in case it modifies the content or makes any enrichment of the content. Under certain cases, courts have held ISPs liable for the user's content for the mere facts that such content was somehow organised or enriched by the ISP (e.g. by organizing the contents in libraries or categories, etc. or monetised by showing ads).\n\n===New Zealand===\nFailing to investigate the material or to make inquiries of the user concerned may amount to negligence in this context: ''Jensen v Clark''  [1982] 2 NZLR 268.\n\n===France===\nDirective 2000/31/CE was transposed into the [[:fr:Loi pour la confiance dans l'\u00e9conomie num\u00e9rique|LCEN]] law.
