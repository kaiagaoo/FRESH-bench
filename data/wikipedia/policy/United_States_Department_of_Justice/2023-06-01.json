At one time, the attorney general gave legal advice to the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], as well as the [[President of the United States|president]]; however, in 1819, the attorney general began advising Congress alone to ensure a manageable workload.<ref name=\"About USDOJ\">{{cite web|title=United States Department of Justice: About DOJ|date=September 16, 2014|url=https://www.justice.gov/about/about.html|access-date=November 22, 2020|archive-date=July 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712154603/http://www.justice.gov/about/about.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Until March 3, 1853, the salary of the attorney general was set by statute at less than the amount paid to other Cabinet members.

Bates had only a small operation, with a staff of six. The main function was to generate legal opinions at the request of Lincoln and cabinet members, and handle occasional cases before the Supreme Court.  Lincoln's cabinet was full of experienced lawyers who seldom felt the need to ask for his opinions. Bates had no authority over the US Attorneys around the country. The federal court system was handled by the Interior Department; the Treasury handled claims.  Most of the opinions turned out by Bates's office were of minor importance.  Lincoln gave him no special assignments and did not seek his advice on Supreme Court appointments. Bates did have an opportunity to comment on general policy as a cabinet member with a strong political base, but he seldom spoke up.<ref>John P.

On February 19, 1868, Lawrence introduced a bill in Congress to create the Department of Justice. President [[Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses S. Grant]] signed the bill into law on June 22, 1870.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Acts of the Forty First Congress|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=016/llsl016.db&recNum=197|access-date=January 23, 2021|archive-date=December 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225160723/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=016%2Fllsl016.db&recNum=197|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGrant appointed [[Amos T. Akerman]] as attorney general and [[Benjamin H. Bristow]] as America's first solicitor general the same week that Congress created the Department of Justice. The department's immediate function was to preserve civil rights. It set about fighting against domestic terrorist groups who had been using both violence and litigation to oppose the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]] Amendments to the Constitution.<ref name=\"chernow-p700\">{{cite book |title=Grant |author=Chernow, Ron |publisher=Penguin Press |year=2017 |page=700}}</ref>\n\nBoth Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute [[Ku Klux Klan]] members in the early 1870s. In the first few years of Grant's first term in office, there were 1000 indictments against Klan members, with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice. By 1871, there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions, with most only serving brief sentences, while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in [[Albany, New York]]. The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South. Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \"better\" or \"stronger\" than Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists.<ref>Smith 2001, pp. 542\u2013547.</ref> [[George Henry Williams|George H.

It is not even known exactly when the original version of the DOJ seal itself was adopted, or when the motto first appeared on the seal.
