In the late 1970s, the need to clean up sites such as [[Love Canal]] that had been highly contaminated by previous hazardous waste disposal became apparent. However the existing regulatory environment depended on owners or operators to perform environmental control. While the EPA attempted to use RCRA's section 7003 to perform this cleanup, it was clear a new law was needed. In 1980, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as \"Superfund\".<ref>United States. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. {{uspl|96|510}}, approved December 11, 1980. {{USC|42|9601}} ''et seq.''</ref> This law enabled the EPA to cast a wider net for responsible parties, including past or present generators and transporters as well as current and past owners of the site to find funding. The act also established some funding and a tax mechanism on certain industries to help fund such cleanup. Congress did not renew the Superfund tax in the 1990s, and subsequently funding for cleanup actions was supported only by general appropriations. Congress restored an excise tax on chemical manufacturers in 2021, which will eventually increase the available budget for site cleanups.<ref name = \"infrastructure act 2021\"/> Today, due to restricted funding, most cleanup activities are performed by responsible parties under the oversight of the EPA and states. {{As of|2016}}, more than 1,700 sites had been put on the cleanup list since the creation of the program. Of these, 370 sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list, cleanup is underway at 535, cleanup facilities have been constructed at 790 but need to be operated in the future, and 54 are not yet in cleanup stage.<ref name=\"Voltaggio-2019\" />{{Update inline|date=March 2023}}\n* EPA's '''oil spill prevention program''' includes the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) and the Facility Response Plan (FRP) rules. The SPCC Rule applies to all facilities that store, handle, process, gather, transfer, refine, distribute, use or consume oil or oil products. Oil products includes petroleum and non-petroleum oils as well as: animal fats, oils and greases; fish and marine mammal oils; and vegetable oils. It mandates a written plan for facilities that store more than 1,320 gallons of fuel above ground or more than 42,000 gallons below-ground, and which might discharge to navigable waters (as defined in the Clean Water Act) or adjoining shorelines.

Another report in September 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs, policies, and activities toward environmental justice.<ref>{{cite conference |last = Bullard |first = Robert |date = July 25, 2007 |title = Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Regarding Environmental Justice}}</ref> Studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the EPA's [[Superfund]] program, and that this situation was worsening.<ref name = \"O'Neil report\"/>\nIn August 2022 the EPA was allotted a listed ~42.8 billion in funding from the [[Inflation Reduction Act of 2022|Inflation Reduction Act]] (IRA) towards what the EPA classifies as \"Advancing Environmental Justice\", and published the statement \"Through the Inflation Reduction Act, EPA will improve the lives of millions of Americans by reducing pollution in neighborhoods where people live, work, play, and go to school; accelerating environmental justice efforts in communities overburdened by pollution for far too long; and tackling our biggest climate challenges while creating jobs and delivering energy security.\"<ref>{{cite web |title = Advancing Environmental Justice |url = https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/advancing-environmental-justice |date= 2022-12-19 |publisher = EPA }}</ref>\nIn September 2022 EPA announced the creation of a new Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights that reports directly to the EPA administrator.<ref>{{cite news |last = Dennis |first = Brady | title = EPA unveils new office to place environmental justice at agency's core |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/09/24/epa-environmental-justice/ |date = 2022-09-24 |newspaper = The Washington Post}}</ref> The new office has an expanded budget and staff with broader responsibilities than under the previous organizational arrangement.<ref name = \"About OEJECR\"/>\n\n===Freedom of Information Act processing performance===\nIn the latest [[Center for Effective Government]] analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) requests, published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the EPA earned a D by scoring 67 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade.<ref>[http://www.foreffectivegov.org/access-to-information-scorecard-2015/ Making the Grade: Access to Information Scorecard 2015] {{Webarchive|url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190811044220/https://www.foreffectivegov.org/access-to-information-scorecard-2015 |date = August 11, 2019 }} March 2015, 80 pages, [[Center for Effective Government]], retrieved March 21, 2016</ref>\n\n===Pebble Mine===\n[[Pebble Mine]] is a copper and gold mining project located in the southwest region of Alaska in the [[Bristol Bay]] region organized by Northern Dynasty Minerals.<ref>{{cite web |title=History and Location |url=https://northerndynastyminerals.com/pebble-project/history-and-location/ |access-date=2023-01-07 |website=Pebble Project |publisher=Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. |location=Vancouver, BC}}</ref> In 2014 the EPA released its statement on the impacts that mining would have on Bristol Bay and its tributaries.
