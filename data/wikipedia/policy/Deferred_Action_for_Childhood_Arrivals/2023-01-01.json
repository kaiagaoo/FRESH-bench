[[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) began accepting applications for the program on August 15, 2012.\n\nIn November 2014, President Obama announced his intention to [[expand DACA]] to cover additional undocumented immigrants. Multiple states immediately sued to prevent the expansion, which was blocked June 23, 2016 by an evenly divided [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. Texas (2016)|United States v. Texas]]''.\n\nUnder President [[Donald Trump]], the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] rescinded the expansion in June 2017, while it continued to review the existence of DACA as a whole. In September 2017, the [[Trump administration]] announced a plan to phase out DACA, triggering multiple lawsuits challenging this action. The government deferred implementation of this plan for six months to allow Congress time to pass the DREAM Act or some other legislative protection for undocumented immigrants. Congress failed to act and the time extension expired on March 5, 2018, but three separate [[U.S. district courts]] ordered an injunction preventing the phase-out of the DACA by this date, on the likelihood that the rescinding was [[arbitrary and capricious]] under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] (APA). Separately, on August 31, 2018, district court judge [[Andrew Hanen]] of the [[Southern District of Texas]] ruled that DACA is likely unconstitutional, but he let the program remain in place as litigation proceeded.<ref name=\":18\">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/08/31/643814735/texas-judge-says-daca-is-probably-illegal-but-leaves-it-in-place|title=Texas Judge Says DACA Is Probably Illegal, But Leaves It In Place|work=NPR.org|access-date=September 10, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":19\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-txsd-1_18-cv-00068/pdf/USCOURTS-txsd-1_18-cv-00068-0.pdf|title=Texas v.
