The GDPR is an important component of EU [[privacy law]] and of [[human rights law]], in particular Article 8(1) of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. It also addresses the transfer of [[personal data]] outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR's primary aim is to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for [[international business]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9565-2015-INIT/en/pdf|title=Presidency of the Council: 'Compromise text.

As the GDPR is a regulation, not a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]], it is directly binding and applicable, and provides flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states.\n\nThe regulation became a model for many other laws across the world, including in [[Turkey]], [[Mauritius]], [[Chile]], [[Japan]], [[Brazil]], [[South Korea]], [[South Africa]], [[Argentina]] and [[Kenya]]. {{as of|2022|October|6}}, the [[United Kingdom]] retains the law in identical form despite [[Brexit|no longer being an EU member state]].

Recital 4 proclaims that \u2018processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind\u2019. \n\n===General provisions===\nThe regulation applies if the data controller (an organisation that collects information about living people, whether they are in the EU or not), or processor (an organisation that processes data on behalf of a data controller like cloud service providers), or the data subject (person) is based in the EU. Under certain circumstances,<ref>'''Article 3(2)''': This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:\n(a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or\n(b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.</ref> the regulation also applies to organisations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. The regulation does not apply to the processing of data by a person for a \"purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity.\" (Recital 18)\n\nAccording to the European Commission, \"Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, then you need to consider whether the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account the information you are processing together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify that individual.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/|title=What is personal data?|date=January 2021|access-date=22 July 2019|archive-date=24 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724112940/https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/|url-status=live}}</ref> The precise definitions of terms such as \"personal data\", \"processing\", \"data subject\", \"controller\", and \"processor\" are stated in '''Article 4''' of the Regulation.<ref name=\"eur-lex.europa.eu\">{{cite web|access-date=21 March 2018|title=EUR-Lex \u2013 32016R0679 \u2013 EN \u2013 EUR-Lex|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317035823/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng|archive-date=17 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe regulation does not purport to apply to the processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement of the EU; however, industry groups concerned about facing a potential conflict of laws have questioned whether '''Article 48'''<ref name=\"eur-lex.europa.eu\"/> of the GDPR could be invoked to seek to prevent a data controller subject to a third country's laws from complying with a legal order from that country's law enforcement, judicial, or national security authorities to disclose to such authorities the personal data of an EU person, regardless of whether the data resides in or out of the EU. '''Article 48''' states that any judgement of a court or [[tribunal]] and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may not be recognised or enforceable in any manner unless based on an international agreement, like a [[mutual legal assistance treaty]] in force between the requesting third (non-EU) country and the EU or a member state.<ref name=\"Article 30\"/> The data protection reform package also includes a separate Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector that provides rules on personal data exchanges at [[Member state of the European Union|State level]], Union level, and international levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/680/oj/eng|title=Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA|date=4 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nA single set of rules applies to all EU member states. Each member state establishes an independent supervisory authority (SA) to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offences, etc. SAs in each member state co-operate with other SAs, providing mutual assistance and organising joint operations. If a business has multiple establishments in the EU, it must have a single SA as its \"lead authority\", based on the location of its \"main establishment\" where the main processing activities take place. The lead authority thus acts as a \"[[one-stop shop]]\" to supervise all the processing activities of that business throughout the EU ('''Articles 46\u201355''' of the GDPR).<ref>The Proposed EU General Data Protection Regulation.

Firms have the obligation to protect data of employees and consumers to the degree where only the necessary data is extracted with minimum interference with data privacy from employees, consumers, or third parties. Firms should have internal controls and regulations for various departments such as audit, internal controls, and operations. Data subjects have the right to request a [[Data portability|portable]] copy of the data collected by a controller in a common format, as well as the right to have their [[Data erasure|data erased]] under certain circumstances. Public authorities, and businesses whose core activities consist of regular or systematic processing of personal data, are required to employ a ''data protection officer'' (DPO), who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Businesses must report [[data breach]]es to national supervisory authorities within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to \u20ac20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.\n\nTo be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller must implement measures that meet the principles of data protection by design and by default. '''Article 25''' requires data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include [[pseudonymization|pseudonymising]] personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible (Recital 78). It is the responsibility and the liability of the data controller to implement effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities even if the processing is carried out by a data processor on behalf of the controller (Recital 74).<ref name=\"Article 30\"/>\nWhen data is collected, data subjects must be clearly [[privacy policy|informed]] about the extent of data collection, the legal basis for the processing of personal data, how long data is retained, if data is being transferred to a third-party and/or outside the EU, and any [[automated decision-making]] that is made on a solely [[algorithm]]ic basis.

It specifies that encryption and decryption operations must be carried out locally, not by remote service, because both keys and data must remain in the power of the data owner if any privacy is to be achieved. The report specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical and relatively safe if only the data owner, not the cloud service, holds the decryption keys.\n\n====Pseudonymisation====\nAccording to the GDPR, [[Pseudonymization|pseudonymisation]] is a required process for stored data that transforms personal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information (as an alternative to the other option of complete [[data anonymisation]]).<ref>[https://www.dativa.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/ Data science under GDPR with pseudonymization in the data pipeline] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418230748/https://www.dativa.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/|date=18 April 2018}} Published by Dativa, 17 April 2018</ref> An example is [[Encryption software|encryption]], which renders the original data unintelligible in a process that cannot be reversed without access to the correct [[Encryption|decryption key]]. The GDPR requires for the additional information (such as the decryption key) to be kept separately from the pseudonymised data.\n\nAnother example of pseudonymisation is [[tokenization (data security)|tokenisation]], which is a non-mathematical approach to protecting [[data at rest]] that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, referred to as tokens. While the tokens have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value, they allow for specific data to be fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden. [[Tokenization (data security)|Tokenisation]] does not alter the type or length of data, which means it can be processed by legacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type. This also requires much fewer computational resources to process and less storage space in databases than traditionally-encrypted data.\n\nPseudonymisation is a [[Privacy-enhancing technologies|privacy-enhancing technology]] and is recommended to reduce the risks to the concerned data subjects and also to help controllers and processors to meet their data protection obligations (Recital 28).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://iapp.org/news/a/looking-to-comply-with-gdpr-heres-a-primer-on-anonymization-and-pseudonymization/|title=Looking to comply with GDPR?

Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using [[pseudonymization]] or full [[Data anonymization|anonymization]] where appropriate). Data controllers must design information systems with privacy in mind. For instance, using the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publicly available by default and cannot be used to identify a subject. No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under one of the six lawful bases specified by the regulation ([[consent]], contract, public task, vital interest, legitimate interest or legal requirement). When the processing is based on consent the data subject has the right to revoke it at any time.\n\n'''Article 33''' states the data controller is under a legal obligation to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individuals. There is a maximum of 72 hours after becoming aware of the data breach to make the report. Individuals have to be notified if a high risk of an adverse impact is determined ('''Article 34'''). In addition, the data processor will have to notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach ('''Article 33''').\nHowever, the notice to data subjects is not required if the data controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption ('''Article 34''').<ref name=\"Article 30\"/>\n\n====Data protection officer====\n{{See also|European Commission Data Protection Officer}}\n'''Article 37''' requires appointment of a data protection officer.

In any case, the processing body must make sure that there is no conflict of interest in other roles or interests that a DPO may hold. The contact details for the DPO must be published by the processing organisation (for example, in a privacy notice) and registered with the supervisory authority.\n\nThe DPO is similar to a compliance officer and is also expected to be proficient at managing IT processes, [[data security]] (including dealing with [[Attack (computing)|cyberattacks]]) and other critical [[business continuity]] issues associated with the holding and processing of personal and sensitive data. The skill set required stretches beyond understanding legal compliance with data protection laws and regulations.

European subsidiaries of U.S. [[big tech]] companies \u2013 were facing significant backlogs in their investigations of major foreign companies under GDPR, with Ireland citing the complexity of the

Critics interviewed by ''Politico'' also argued that enforcement was also being hampered by varying interpretations between member states, the prioritisation of guidance over enforcement by some authorities, and a lack of cooperation between member states.<ref>{{Cite web|title='We have a huge problem': European regulator despairs over lack of enforcement|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/we-have-a-huge-problem-european-regulator-despairs-over-lack-of-enforcement/|last=Vinocur|first=Nicholas|date=27 December 2019|website=Politico|access-date=6 May 2020|archive-date=28 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228111507/https://www.politico.eu/article/we-have-a-huge-problem-european-regulator-despairs-over-lack-of-enforcement/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2021, Irish Council for Civil Liberties lodged a formal complaint of the Commission that it is in breach of its obligation under EU Law to carefully monitor how Ireland applies the GDPR. <ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web |last=Ryan |first=Johnny |date=2023-01-31 |title=Europe-wide overhaul of GDPR monitoring triggered by ICCL |url=https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/europe-wide-overhaul-of-gdpr-monitoring-triggered-by-iccl/ |access-date=2023-04-08 |website=Irish Council for Civil Liberties |language=en-GB |archive-date=6 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406075809/https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/europe-wide-overhaul-of-gdpr-monitoring-triggered-by-iccl/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Until January 2023, the Commission published a new commitment based on the complaint of ICCL. <ref name=\":10\" /> The commitment by the Commission to receive bi-monthly reports from national DPAs on large-scale cross-border investigations, and provide an account of its practice in the second report on GDPR application, is a positive step towards improving cross-border GDPR enforcement. However, only a commitment is far from enough, there are still issues and challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that the GDPR enforcement system for national data protection authorities is effective. From the vertical perspective, this commitment lacks clarity on how the Commission will use the information received from the national DPAs. From the horizontal perspective, this commitment is limited in scope of information shared between DPAs and does not focus on mutual cooperation among national DPAs.\n\nWhile companies are now subject to legal obligations, there are still various inconsistencies in the practical and technical implementation of GDPR.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Alizadeh|first1=Fatemeh|last2=Jakobi|first2=Timo|last3=Boldt|first3=Jens|last4=Stevens|first4=Gunnar|date=2019|title=GDPR-Reality Check on the Right to Access Data|journal=Proceedings of Mensch und Computer 2019 on - MuC'19|pages=811\u2013814|location=New York|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/3340764.3344913|isbn=978-1-4503-7198-8|s2cid=202159324}}</ref> As an example, according to the GDPR's right to access, the companies are obliged to provide data subjects with the data they gather about them.
