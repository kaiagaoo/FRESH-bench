The Act clarified the overall decision-making authority of the secretary of defense with respect to these subordinate Military Departments and more clearly defined the operational [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] over U.S. military forces (created by the military departments) as running from the president to the secretary of defense and then to the unified combatant commanders.

Because the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] vests all military authority in [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the president, the statutory authority of the secretary of defense is derived from their constitutional authority. Since it is impractical for either Congress or the president to participate in every piece of Department of Defense affairs, the secretary of defense and the secretary's subordinate officials generally exercise military authority.\n\nThe Department of Defense is composed of the Office of the Secretary of Defense ([[Office of the Secretary of Defense|OSD]]), the Joint Chiefs of Staff ([[Joint Chiefs of Staff|JCS]]) and the Joint Staff ([[Joint Staff|JS]]), Office of the Inspector General ([[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|DODIG]]), the [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]], the Military Departments ([[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]] (DA), [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] (DON) & [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] (DAF)), the [[List of Department of Defense agencies|Defense Agencies and Department of Defense Field Activities]], the [[National Guard Bureau]] (NGB), and such other offices, agencies, activities, organizations, and commands established or designated by law, or by the president or by the secretary of defense.\n\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5100.01 describes the organizational relationships within the department, and is the foundational issuance for delineating the major functions of the department.
