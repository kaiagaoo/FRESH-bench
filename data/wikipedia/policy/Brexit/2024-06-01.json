Following a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]] on 23 June 2016, Brexit officially took place at 23:00 [[GMT]] on 31 January 2020 (00:00 1 February 2020 [[Central European Time|CET]]).{{efn|The UK also left the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EAEC or Euratom).}} The UK is the only [[sovereign country]] to have left the EU. The UK had been a member state of the EU or its predecessor, the [[European Communities]] (EC), since 1 January 1973. Following Brexit, [[EU law]] and the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] no longer have [[Primacy of European Union law|primacy over British laws]]. The [[European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018]] retains relevant EU law as [[Law of the United Kingdom|domestic law]], which the UK can amend or repeal. \n\nThe EU and its institutions developed gradually after their establishment. Throughout the period of British membership, [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Eurosceptic]] groups had existed, opposing aspects of the EU and its predecessors. [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] prime minister [[Harold Wilson]]'s pro-EC government held [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|a referendum on continued EC membership in 1975]], in which 67.2 per cent of those voting chose to stay within the bloc. Despite growing political opposition to further [[European integration]] aimed at \"[[ever closer union]]\" between 1975 and 2016, notably from [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the late 1980s and 1990s, and factions of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the 2000s, no further referendums on the issue were held.\n\nBy the 2010s, the growing popularity of [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), as well as pressure from Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party, persuaded then-Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] to promise a referendum on British membership of the EU if his government was re-elected. Following the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|general election in 2015]], which produced a small but unexpected overall majority for the governing Conservative Party, the promised referendum on continued EU membership was held on 23 June 2016. Notable supporters of the [[Britain Stronger in Europe|Remain]] campaign included Cameron, future Prime Ministers [[Theresa May]] and [[Liz Truss]], and former Prime Ministers [[John Major]], [[Tony Blair]], and [[Gordon Brown]]; while notable supporters of the [[Vote Leave|Leave]] campaign included future Prime Ministers [[Boris Johnson]] and [[Rishi Sunak]]. The electorate voted to leave the EU with a 51.9% share of the vote, with all regions of [[England]] and [[Wales]] except [[Greater London|London]] voting in favour of Brexit, and [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] voting against. The result led to Cameron's sudden resignation, his replacement by then-Home Secretary Theresa May, and four years of negotiations with the EU on the terms of departure and on future relations, completed under a Boris Johnson government, with government control remaining with the Conservative Party during this period.\n\nThe negotiation process was both politically challenging and deeply divisive within the UK, leading to two [[snap election]]s in 2017 and 2019. One deal was overwhelmingly rejected by the [[UK Parliament]], causing great uncertainty and leading to postponement of the withdrawal date to avoid a [[no-deal Brexit]]. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 after a withdrawal deal was passed by Parliament, but continued to participate in many EU institutions (including the single market and customs union) during an [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|eleven-month transition period]] in order to ensure frictionless trade until all details of the post-Brexit relationship were agreed and implemented. [[Trade negotiation between the UK and the EU|Trade deal negotiations]] continued within days of the scheduled end of the transition period, and the [[EU\u2013UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement]] was signed on 30 December 2020. The effects of Brexit are in part determined by the cooperation agreement, which [[Provisional application (treaty)|provisionally applied]] from 1 January 2021, until it formally came into force on 1 May 2021.<ref name=\"CouncilRatifies\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/04/29/eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-council-adopts-decision-on-conclusion/|title=EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement: Council adopts decision on conclusion|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|date=29 April 2021|access-date=11 July 2021|archive-date=17 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210817064545/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/04/29/eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-council-adopts-decision-on-conclusion/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n{{main|Timeline of Brexit}}\nFollowing a UK-wide [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum on 23 June 2016]], in which 51.89 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU and 48.11 per cent voted to remain a member, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] resigned. On 29 March 2017, the new [[British government]] led by [[Theresa May]] formally notified the EU of the country's intention to withdraw, beginning the process of [[Brexit negotiations]]. The withdrawal, originally scheduled for 29 March 2019, was delayed by the [[Parliamentary votes on Brexit|deadlock in the British parliament]] after the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|June 2017 general election]], which resulted in a [[hung parliament]] in which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] lost their majority but remained the largest party. This deadlock led to three extensions of the [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|UK's Article 50 process]].\n\nThe deadlock was resolved after a [[2019 United Kingdom general election|subsequent general election was held in December 2019]]. In that election, Conservatives who campaigned in support of a \"revised\" withdrawal agreement led by [[Boris Johnson]] won an overall majority of 80 seats. After the December 2019 election, the British parliament finally ratified the [[withdrawal agreement]] with the [[European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020]]. The UK left the EU at the end of 31 January 2020 [[Central European Time|CET]] (11&nbsp;p.m. [[GMT]]). This began a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 CET (11&nbsp;p.m. GMT), during which the UK and EU negotiated their future relationship.<ref name=\"Bennett\">{{cite news|last=Bennett|first=Asa|title=How will the Brexit transition period work?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/brexit-2020-transition-period/|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 January 2020|access-date=28 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128044559/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/brexit-2020-transition-period/|archive-date=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> During the transition, the UK remained subject to [[EU law]] and remained part of the [[European Union Customs Union]] and the [[European single market]].

[[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|In 1973, the UK joined]] the [[European Communities]] (EC) \u2013 principally the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) \u2013 and its continued membership was endorsed in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 membership referendum]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EC was advocated mainly by the political left, e.g. in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s 1983 election manifesto. The 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]], which founded the EU, was [[European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993|ratified by the British parliament in 1993]] but was not put to a referendum. The Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party led [[Maastricht Rebels|a rebellion]] over the ratification of the treaty and, with the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) and the cross-party [[People's Pledge]] campaign, then led a collective campaign, particularly after the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was also ratified by the [[European Union (Amendment) Act 2008]] without being put to a referendum following a previous promise to hold [[European Union Bill 2004\u20132005|a referendum]] on ratifying the abandoned [[European Constitution]], which was never held. After promising to hold a second membership referendum if his government was elected, Conservative prime minister David Cameron held this referendum in 2016. Cameron, who had campaigned to remain, resigned after the result and was succeeded by [[Theresa May]].\n\nOn 29 March 2017, the British government formally began the withdrawal process by invoking Article 50 of the [[Treaty on European Union]] with [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017|permission from Parliament]]. May called [[2017 United Kingdom general election|a snap general election]] in June 2017, which resulted in a Conservative minority government [[Confidence and supply|supported]] by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). UK\u2013EU withdrawal negotiations began later that month. The UK negotiated to leave the EU customs union and single market. This resulted in the November 2018 [[withdrawal agreement]], but the British parliament [[Parliamentary votes on Brexit|voted against ratifying it]] three times. The Labour Party wanted any agreement to maintain a customs union, while many Conservatives opposed the agreement's [[Brexit divorce bill|financial settlement]], as well as the \"[[Irish backstop]]\" designed to prevent border controls between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), and others sought to reverse Brexit through [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|a proposed second referendum]].\n\nOn 14 March 2019, the British parliament voted for May to ask the EU to delay Brexit until June, and then later October.<ref name=\"Parliament UK\">{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2019/march/house-of-commons-to-vote-on-article-50-extension/|title=House of Commons votes to seek Article 50 extension|date=14 March 2019|access-date=11 May 2020|archive-date=7 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307030308/https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2019/march/house-of-commons-to-vote-on-article-50-extension/|url-status=live}}</ref> Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as Prime Minister in July and was succeeded by [[Boris Johnson]].

In accordance with [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]], specifically that of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], ratification in the UK was not subject to approval by referendum. Despite this, British constitutional historian [[Vernon Bogdanor]] wrote that there was \"a clear constitutional rationale for requiring a referendum\" because although MPs are entrusted with legislative power by the electorate, they are not given authority to transfer that power (the UK's previous three referendums all concerned this). Further, as the ratification of the treaty was in the manifestos of the three major political parties, voters opposed to ratification had limited options for expressing this. For Bogdanor, while the ratification by the House of Commons might be legal, it would not be legitimate\u2014which requires popular consent. The way in which the treaty was ratified, he judged, was \"likely to have fundamental consequences both for British politics and for Britain's relationship with the [EC].\"<ref>Bogdanor also quotes [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government|The Second Treatise of Government]]'': 'The Legislative cannot transfer the power of making laws to any other hands. For it being but a delegated power from the People, they who have it cannot pass it to others.' \u2013 Bogdanor, Vernon (8 June 1993).
