An advisory committee was formed to oversee the further development of the NIH and its research programs.

This process begins with institute and center (IC) leaders collaborating with scientists to determine the most important and promising research areas within their fields. IC leaders discuss research areas with NIH management who then develops a budget request for continuing projects, new research proposals, and new initiatives from the Director. The NIH submits its budget request to the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), and the HHS considers this request as a portion of its budget. Many adjustments and appeals occur between the NIH and HHS before the agency submits NIH's budget request to the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB). OMB determines what amounts and research areas are approved for incorporation into the President's final budget. The President then sends the NIH's budget request to Congress in February for the next fiscal year's allocations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Funding|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33695.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060502/http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33695.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees deliberate and by fall, Congress usually appropriates funding.

In the 1970s, Congress began to earmark funds specifically for cancer research, and in the 1980s there was a significant amount allocated for AIDS/HIV research.<ref name=\"Funding\" />\n\nFunding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. During the 1980s, President Reagan repeatedly tried to cut funding for research, only to see Congress partly restore funding. The political contention over NIH funding slowed the nation's response to the AIDS epidemic; while AIDS was reported in newspaper articles from 1981, no funding was provided for research on the disease. In 1984 National Cancer Institute scientists found implications that \"variants of a human cancer virus called HTLV-III are the primary cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),\" a new epidemic that gripped the nation.<ref>{{harvnb|NIH Almanac|2011|loc=[http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/chronology_of_events.htm#nineteeneighty History: Chronology of Events: 1980\u2013]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government's operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities.<ref name=\"Laurie J.

First, ensure the highest quality of scientific research by employing an arduous peer review process. Second, seize opportunities that have the greatest potential to yield new knowledge and that will lead to better prevention and treatment of disease. Third, maintain a diverse research portfolio in order to capitalize on major discoveries in a variety of fields such as cell biology, genetics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Fourth, address public health needs according to the disease burden (e.g., prevalence and mortality).

Extramural researchers differ from intramural researchers in that they are not employed by the NIH but may apply for funding. Throughout the history of the NIH, the amount of funding received has increased, but the proportion to each IC remains relatively constant. The individual ICs then decide who will receive the grant money and how much will be allotted.\n\nPolicy changes on who receives funding significantly affect researchers. For example, the NIH has recently attempted to approve more first-time NIH R01 applicants or the research grant applications of young scientists. To encourage the participation of young scientists, the application process has been shortened and made easier.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Science |year=2008 |volume=322 |issue=5905 |pages=1187\u20138 |doi=10.1126/science.322.5905.1187c |title=Changes to NIH grant system may backfire |vauthors=Karp PD, Sherlock G, Gerlt JA, Sim I, Paulsen I, Babbitt PC, Laderoute K, Hunter L, Sternberg P, Wooley J, Bourne PE |pmid=19023064|s2cid=47509185 }}</ref> In addition, first-time applicants are being offered more funding for their research grants than those who have received grants in the past.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Acad Med |date=May 2010 |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=775\u20139 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181d74256 |pmid=20520024 |title=Perspective: is NIH funding the \"best science by the best scientists\"?
