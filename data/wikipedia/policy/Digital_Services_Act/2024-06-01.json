This case highlighted the responsibilities of platforms to prevent the spread of harmful content.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nOn the other hand, the MTE and Index.hu v.

The ECtHR ruled that imposing strict liability on platforms for user comments, without consideration of the nature of the comments or the context in which they were made, could infringe on freedom of expression. This judgment emphasized the need for a balance between protecting reputation and upholding free speech on digital platforms.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThese decisions by the ECtHR provided critical legal precedents that shaped the EU\u2019s decision-making process on the framework of the DSA. In particular, the DSA drew from the ECtHR's distinction between different types of illegal content, as well as its proportionality analysis in both cases, by incorporating nuanced rules on intermediary liability and ensuring that measures taken by platforms do not unreasonably restrict users' freedom of expression and information.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Digital Services Act and the EU as the Global Regulator of the Internet {{!}} Chicago Journal of International Law |url=https://cjil.uchicago.edu/print-archive/digital-services-act-and-eu-global-regulator-internet#heading-2 |access-date=2024-05-16 |website=cjil.uchicago.edu}}</ref>\n\n== Reactions ==\nMedia reactions to the Digital Services Act have been mixed.
