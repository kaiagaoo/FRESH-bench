It found that the Act was insufficient in dealing with what it saw as the effective [[monopolization]] and [[monopsony]] of the American semiconductor industry by TSMC and by 'fabless' semiconductor firms that practiced routine outsourcing, such as [[Nvidia]] and [[Apple Inc.]], the result of shareholder-driven decisions. It also found the Act was insufficient in shoring up American mid-level, consumer market-oriented manufacturing by increasing competition and resiliency there. It recommended that the Commerce Department increasingly involve the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and other antitrust agencies in its decision-making, incubate four mid-size competitors to TSMC, require 'fabless' firms to double their source numbers, and strategically levy [[tariff]]s and fees on select consumer electronics deemed lacking in American sourcing.<ref name=\"Achilles Peinert Rangel 2024\">{{cite web | last1=Achilles | first1=Todd | last2=Peinert | first2=Erik | last3=Rangel | first3=Daniel | title=Reshoring and Restoring: CHIPS Implementation for a Competitive Semiconductor Industry | website=American Economic Liberties Project | date=February 6, 2024 | url=https://www.economicliberties.us/our-work/reshoring-and-restoring-chips-implementation-for-a-competitive-semiconductor-industry/ | access-date=March 17, 2024}}</ref>\n\n== Impact ==\n{{update section|date=September 2023}}\n\n===Science impact===\n{{Expand section|small=no|find=impact of CHIPS and Science Act on basic research -semiconductors|with=some examples of research projects benefiting from the act, beyond semiconductors and telecom|date=April 2024}}\nIn August 2023, around the one-year anniversary of the act becoming law, the NSF released a fact sheet outlining what it had done in the first year.
