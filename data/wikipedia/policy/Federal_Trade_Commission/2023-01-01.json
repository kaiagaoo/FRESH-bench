The agency is headquartered in the [[Federal Trade Commission Building]] in [[Washington, DC]].\n\nThe FTC was established in 1914 with the passage of the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]], signed in response to the [[Trust (19th century)|19th-century monopolistic trust crisis]]. Since its inception, the FTC has enforced the provisions of the [[Clayton Act]], a key [[antitrust]] statute, as well as the provisions of the [[FTC Act]], {{UnitedStatesCode|15|41}} et seq. Over time, the FTC has been delegated with the enforcement of additional business regulation statutes and has promulgated a number of regulations (codified in [[Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]).

With the written consent of the commission, Bureau attorneys enforce federal laws related to consumer affairs and rules promulgated by the FTC. Its functions include investigations, enforcement actions, and consumer and business education. Areas of principal concern for this bureau are: advertising and marketing, financial products and practices, [[telemarketing fraud]], privacy and identity protection, etc. The bureau also is responsible for the [[United States National Do Not Call Registry]].\n\nUnder the FTC Act, the commission has the authority, in most cases, to bring its actions in federal court through its own attorneys. In some consumer protection matters, the FTC appears with, or supports, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].\n\n===Bureau of Competition===\nThe Bureau of Competition is the division of the FTC charged with elimination and prevention of \"anticompetitive\" business practices. It accomplishes this through the enforcement of [[antitrust]] laws, review of proposed [[merger]]s, and investigation into other non-merger business practices that may impair competition. Such non-merger practices include horizontal restraints, involving agreements between direct competitors, and [[vertical restraints]], involving agreements among businesses at different levels in the same industry (such as suppliers and commercial buyers).[[File:ApexBuildingHighsmith.jpg|thumb|right|218px|Apex Building, built in 1938 (FTC headquarters) in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]The FTC shares enforcement of antitrust laws with the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

These issues include, for instance, [[false advertising]] and other forms of [[fraud]]. FTC investigations may pertain to a single company or an entire industry. If the results of the investigation reveal unlawful conduct, the FTC may seek voluntary compliance by the offending business through a [[consent judgment|consent order]], file an administrative complaint, or initiate federal litigation. During the course of regulatory activities, the FTC is authorized to collect records, but not on-site inspections.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2018-08-01|title=Regulatory Monitors: Policing Firms in the Compliance Era|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/265|journal=Faculty Scholarship}}</ref>'''{{rp|23}}'''\n\nTraditionally an administrative complaint is heard in front of an independent administrative law judge (ALJ) with FTC staff acting as prosecutors. The case is reviewed ''de novo'' by the full FTC commission which then may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals and finally to the Supreme Court.\n\nUnder the FTC Act, the federal courts retain their traditional authority to issue [[equitable relief]], including the appointment of receivers, monitors, the imposition of asset freezes to guard against the spoliation of funds, immediate access to business premises to preserve evidence, and other relief including financial disclosures and expedited discovery. In numerous cases, the FTC employs this authority to combat serious consumer deception or fraud. Additionally, the FTC has [[rulemaking]] power to address concerns regarding industry-wide practices. Rules promulgated under this authority are known as ''Trade Rules''.\n\nOne of the Federal Trade Commission's other major focuses is [[identity theft]]. The FTC serves as a federal repository for individual consumer complaints regarding identity theft. Even though the FTC does not resolve individual complaints, it does use the aggregated information to determine where federal action might be taken. The complaint form is available online or by phone (1-877-ID-THEFT).\n\nThe FTC has been involved in the oversight of the online advertising industry and its practice of [[FTC regulation of behavioral advertising|behavioral targeting]] for some time. In 2011 the FTC proposed a \"[[Do Not Track]]\" mechanism to allow Internet users to [[opt-out]] of [[behavioral targeting]].\n\nThe FTC, along with the  [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and Department of Justice also empowers third-party enforcer-firms to engage in some regulatory oversight, e.g. the FTC requires other energy companies to audit offshore oil platform operators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2020-04-01|title=The New Gatekeepers: Private Firms as Public Enforcers|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/800|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=106|issue=2|pages=467}}</ref>{{rp|4}}\n\nIn 2013, the FTC issued a comprehensive revision of its [[Green guides]], which set forth standards for environmental marketing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/10/greenguides.shtm |title=FTC Issues Revised \"Green Guides\"  |date=October 1, 2012 |access-date=October 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Unfair or deceptive practices affecting consumers==\n[[File:EndorsementGuides 0.webm|thumb|thumbtime=2:28|upright=1.1|''Endorsement Guides'' from the FTC]]\nSection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, {{UnitedStatesCode|15|45}} grants the FTC power to investigate and prevent ''deceptive'' trade practices.
