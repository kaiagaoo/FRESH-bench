The FTC shares jurisdiction over federal civil antitrust law enforcement with the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Department of Justice Antitrust Division]]. The agency is headquartered in the [[Federal Trade Commission Building]] in [[Washington, DC]].\n\nThe FTC was established in 1914 by the [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914|Federal Trade Commission Act]], which was passed in response to the 19th-century monopolistic trust crisis. Since its inception, the FTC has enforced the provisions of the [[Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914|Clayton Act]], a key U.S. antitrust statute, as well as the provisions of the FTC Act, {{UnitedStatesCode|15|41}} et seq. Over time, the FTC has been delegated with the enforcement of additional business regulation statutes and has promulgated a number of regulations (codified in [[Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]). The broad statutory authority granted to the FTC provides it with more surveillance and monitoring abilities than it actually uses.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2019-10-01|title=The Missing Regulatory State: Monitoring Businesses in an Age of Surveillance|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/678|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|volume=72|issue=5|pages=1563}}</ref>\n\nThe FTC is composed of five commissioners who are nominated by the [[President of the United States|President]] and subject to [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation. Commissioners serve seven-year terms, and no more than three FTC members can be from the same [[Political parties in the United States|party]].

It accomplishes this through the enforcement of [[antitrust]] laws, review of proposed [[merger]]s, and investigation into other non-merger business practices that may impair competition. Such non-merger practices include horizontal restraints, involving agreements between direct competitors, and [[vertical restraints]], involving agreements among businesses at different levels in the same industry (such as suppliers and commercial buyers).\n[[File:The_Apex_Building,_headquarters_of_the_Federal_Trade_Commission,_on_Constitution_Avenue_and_7th_Streets_in_Washington,_D.C.jpg|thumb|Apex Building, built in 1938 (FTC headquarters) in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]]]\nThe FTC shares enforcement of antitrust laws with the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. However, while the FTC is responsible for civil enforcement of antitrust laws, the [[Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice]] has the power to bring both civil and criminal action in antitrust matters.\n\n==== Bureau of Consumer Protection ====\nThe Bureau of Consumer Protection's mandate is to protect consumers against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce. With the written consent of the commission, Bureau attorneys enforce federal laws related to consumer affairs and rules promulgated by the FTC. Its functions include investigations, enforcement actions, and consumer and business education. Areas of principal concern for this bureau are: advertising and marketing, financial products and practices, [[telemarketing fraud]], privacy and identity protection, etc. The bureau also is responsible for the [[United States National Do Not Call Registry]].\n\nUnder the FTC Act, the commission has the authority, in most cases, to bring its actions in federal court through its own attorneys. In some consumer protection matters, the FTC appears with, or supports, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].\n\n==== Bureau of Economics ====\nThe Bureau of Economics was established to support the Bureau of Competition and Consumer Protection by providing expert knowledge related to the economic impacts of the FTC's legislation and operation.\n\n==== Other offices ====\n* The FTC maintains an Office of Technology Research and Investigation to assist it in technology-related enforcement actions.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-08-05|title=Office of Technology Research and Investigation|url=https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection/office-technology-research-investigation|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Federal Trade Commission|language=en}}</ref> \n* The FTC generally selects its Chief Technologist from among computer science academics and noted practitioners.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-05-01|title=FTC Chief Technologists|url=https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/biographies/ftc-chief-technologist|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Federal Trade Commission|language=en}}</ref> The role has previously been filled by [[Steven M.

These issues include, for instance, [[false advertising]] and other forms of [[fraud]]. FTC investigations may pertain to a single company or an entire industry. If the results of the investigation reveal unlawful conduct, the FTC may seek voluntary compliance by the offending business through a [[consent judgment|consent order]], file an administrative complaint, or initiate federal litigation. During the course of regulatory activities, the FTC is authorized to collect records, but not on-site inspections.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2018-08-01|title=Regulatory Monitors: Policing Firms in the Compliance Era|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/265|journal=Faculty Scholarship|volume=119 |issue=2 |page=369 }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally an administrative complaint is heard in front of an independent administrative law judge (ALJ) with FTC staff acting as prosecutors. The case is reviewed ''de novo'' by the full FTC commission which then may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals and finally to the Supreme Court.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}\n\nUnder the FTC Act, the federal courts retain their traditional authority to issue [[equitable relief]], including the appointment of receivers, monitors, the imposition of asset freezes to guard against the spoliation of funds, immediate access to business premises to preserve evidence, and other relief including financial disclosures and expedited discovery. In numerous cases, the FTC employs this authority to combat serious consumer deception or fraud. Additionally, the FTC has [[rulemaking]] power to address concerns regarding industry-wide practices. Rules promulgated under this authority are known as ''Trade Rules''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}\n\nOne of the Federal Trade Commission's other major focuses is [[identity theft]]. The FTC serves as a federal repository for individual consumer complaints regarding identity theft. Even though the FTC does not resolve individual complaints, it does use the aggregated information to determine where federal action might be taken. The complaint form is available online or by phone (1-877-ID-THEFT).{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}\n\nThe FTC has been involved in the oversight of the online advertising industry and its practice of [[FTC regulation of behavioral advertising|behavioral targeting]] for some time.
