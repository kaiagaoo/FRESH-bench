Since the [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9 on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations|formal recognition]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], the Act has defined the officially substantial but non-diplomatic relations between the [[United States of America|US]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1978, the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) administration of the [[People's Republic of China]] claimed to be in a \"[[united front]]\" with the U.S., Japan, and western Europe against the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and thus [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9 on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations|established diplomatic relations with the United States]] in 1979. The CCP also supported American [[Operation Cyclone]] actions in [[Communist Afghanistan]], and leveled [[Sino-Vietnamese War|a military expedition]] against Vietnam, America's main antagonist in Southeast Asia. In exchange for this consideration by the CCP, the [[Carter administration]] cancelled the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]] (SAMDT) with the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC).\n\nThe ROC government mobilized [[China Lobby|its ethnic lobby]] in the United States to lobby Congress for the swift passage of an American security guarantee for the island.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ling |first1=Huping |last2=Austin |first2=Allan W. |title=Asian American History and Culture |date=17 March 2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-47645-0 |page=142 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Newsom |first1=David D. |title=The Public Dimension of Foreign Policy |date=1996 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-21024-1 |page=191 |language=en}}</ref> Taiwan could appeal to members of Congress on many fronts: [[anti-communist]] China sentiment, a shared wartime history with the ROC, [[Human rights in China|Beijing's human rights violations]] and its [[Freedom of religion in China|curtailment of religious freedoms]].<ref name=\"Dittmer\">{{cite book|title=Remaking the Chinese State: Strategies, Society, and Security |editor1-first=Jianmin |editor1-last=Zhao |editor2-first=Bruce| editor2-last=Dickson|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|chapter=Reform and Chinese foreign policy|first=Lowell|last=Dittmer|pages=179}}</ref><ref>ROBERT GREEN, [http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=53214&ctNode=2177 Mixed Signals], [[Taiwan Today]], 07/01/2009</ref>\n\nSenator [[Barry Goldwater]] and other members of the [[United States Congress]] challenged the right of President [[Jimmy Carter]] to unilaterally nullify the SAMDT, which the US had signed with the ROC in December 1954 and was ratified by the U.S. Senate in February 1955. Goldwater and his co-filers of the [[US Supreme Court]] case ''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]'' argued that the President required [[United States Senate|Senate]] approval to take such an action of termination, under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 2: Presidential powers|Article II, Section II]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], and that, by not doing so, President Carter had acted beyond the powers of his office. The case ultimately was dismissed as non-justiciable, leaving open the constitutional question regarding a president's authority to dismiss a treaty unilaterally.<ref name=ait>[https://www.ait.org.tw/en/sino-us-mutual-defense-treaty-1954.html China Mutual Defense (1954)], [[American Institute in Taiwan]]</ref>\n\nThe Act was passed by both chambers of Congress and signed by President Carter in 1979 after the breaking of relations between the US and the ROC. Congress rejected the [[State Department]]'s proposed draft and replaced it with language that has remained in effect since 1979. The TRA is intended to maintain commercial, cultural, and other relations through the unofficial relations in the form of a nonprofit corporation incorporated under the laws of the [[District of Columbia]] \u2013 the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] (AIT) \u2013 without official government representation and without formal diplomatic relations.<ref name=ucsb>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=32177 April 10, 1979: Taiwan Relations Act Statement on Signing H.R. 2479 Into Law], [[UCSD]]</ref> The Act entered retroactively into force, effective January 1, 1979.\n\n==Provisions==\n===Definition of Taiwan===\nThe act does not recognize the terminology of \"Republic of China\" after 1 January 1979, but uses the terminology of \"governing authorities on Taiwan\".

One agreement that was [[unilateral]]ly terminated by President [[Jimmy Carter]] upon the establishment of relations with the PRC was the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]].\n\nThe TRA provides for Taiwan to be treated under U.S. laws the same as \"foreign countries, nations, states, governments, or similar entities\", thus treating Taiwan as a sub-sovereign foreign state equivalent. The act provides that for most practical purposes of the U.S. government, the absence of diplomatic relations and [[recognition (diplomacy)|recognition]] will have no effect.<ref>[http://usinfo.state.gov/eap/Archive_Index/Taiwan_Relations_Act.html Taiwan Relations Act: Public Law 96-8 96th Congress] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518032145/https://usinfo.state.gov/eap/Archive_Index/Taiwan_Relations_Act.html |date=2008-05-18 }} Sec. 4 under APPLICATION OF LAWS; INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS</ref>\n\n===Military provisions===\n{{See also|List of US arms sales to Taiwan}}\nThe TRA does not guarantee the U.S. will intervene militarily if the PRC attacks or invades Taiwan nor does it relinquish it, as its primary purpose is to ensure the US's Taiwan policy will not be changed unilaterally by the president and ensure any decision to defend Taiwan will be made with the consent of Congress. The act states that \"the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability\", and \"shall maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan\".<ref>https://www.congress.gov/96/statute/STATUTE-93/STATUTE-93-Pg14.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=September 2022}}</ref> However, the decision about the nature and quantity of defense services that America will provide to Taiwan is to be determined by the President and Congress.
