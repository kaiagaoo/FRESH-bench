The term gatekeeper refers to the ability of intermediary platforms to act as the main \"bottleneck\" to a large number of market participants, that are not reachable elsewhere. Behind this development are market forces that encompass (1) important economies of scale on the supply side; (2) strong direct and indirect network effects on the demand-side; (3) data-driven competitive advantage; (4) high rate of innovation; and (5) development of conglomerates that structure entire ecosystems.<ref name=\":3\"/> In addition, the combination of these elements can lead to market dynamics that follow the \"winner-takes-most\" scenarios.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nBy way of illustration, there can be considered a hypothetical market for mobile operating systems (OS), formed by one large OS (in terms of consumer base) and a smaller one. Following the assumption according to which the higher the number of persons using a particular OS, the more attractive this OS will be for app developers, under these circumstances, the largest OS may benefit from stronger indirect network effects. Thus, developers will tend to favour the largest OS for their apps because this enables them to reach a larger customer base and a bigger market. Due to these factors, the benefits gap provided by the larger OS and its smaller counterparts, respectively, is expected to grow in time. Moreover, the large OS will gather and process more data than its competitors, aspect that will support the improvement of quality. In parallel, the small OS will become less attractive to both customers and app developers, until it possibly vanishes from the market and the largest OS takes all. According to Joe Belfiore, the current Corporate Vice President in the Experiences and Devices division of Microsoft, one of the reasons that Microsoft decided to leave the mobile market was its inability to attract enough app makers for its operating system.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nDuring the last years, serious concerns have been expressed by authorities across the world with regard to the economic power of some digital giants. In Europe, the European Commission \u2013 backed by years of enforcement experience in EU competition law<ref name=\":02\"/> \u2013 has pointed out that a part of those intermediary platforms may be considered \"Gatekeeper\" or \"structuring platforms\" in their respective market segments.<ref name=\":2\"/> Moreover, it has also expressed the concern that Big Tech companies might unlawfully take advantage of their market and bargaining powers, in order to lock in dominant positions (i.e. in the existing markets), to increase their level of influence, and to obtain leading positions in new sectors of activity. Hence, this can be interpreted as providing unfair advantages to the incumbents present in core and ancillary services, as distorting the competition, and as harming the consumers, in the long run, through either increased prices or reduced options.<ref name=\":2\"/> Under EU competition law, reaching a \"dominant position\" is by no mean considered illegal, nor is the idea of a \"winner takes most\" scenario. However, practices that lock in dominant positions or that impose unfair conditions, terms to third parties might be treated as unlawful.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nIt should be mentioned that the economics behind this approach are not always straightforward, taking into account that the effects generated by a company's behaviour often lead, at the same time, to pro and anti-competitive results. If one specific digital platform decides to extend from its core market, where it holds a dominant position, to another related market by offering a wider range of products or services to its consumers, this might be viewed as an example of bundling. In Microsoft's case, given the bundling of Teams with the cloud-based Office software, every user of Microsoft Office software can freely enjoy the Microsoft Teams application. On the one hand, this development is able to deliver benefits for consumers, because it usually increases the synergies between different products provided by a common operator. On the other hand, the same practice can also lead to the exclusion of efficient niche competitors, and affect the efficient providers of complementary products or prevent potential competitors from entering the market, consequently foreclosing the market for the benefit of Microsoft's growth.<ref name=\":3\"/>\n\nTherefore, the economic impact generated by gatekeepers' behaviour can be interpreted under the form of trade-offs, taking into account that their selection depends on various sets of values, rights and interests. An example for the abovementioned trade-off trend can be considered the relation between short term competition versus long term competition. Thus, if we reiterate the previous bundling practice of Microsoft, we can infer that in the short term, consumer welfare may increase (short term competition), but at the same time, it can also be detrimental to consumers in the long run, due to reduced competition and the lack of incentives for Microsoft to further innovate. In addition, another possible trade-off might be derived from the linkage between competition and innovation. While the acquisition of a start-up by a gatekeeper may contribute to the development and/or to the diffusion of the underlying innovation brought by the former, this may be detrimental to the consumers in the long run.<ref name=\":3\"/>\n\nThe Proposal on the Digital Markets Act has the aim to increase digital markets' contestability and to ensure a significant level of fairness.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite web|last=de Streel|first=Alexander|date=13 January 2021|title=Digital Markets Act: Policy Choices and Conditions for Success|url=https://promarket.org/2021/01/13/digital-markets-act-explainer-european-regulation-big-tech/|url-status=live|access-date=10 March 2021|website=Promarket|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210113084646/https://promarket.org/2021/01/13/digital-markets-act-explainer-european-regulation-big-tech/ |archive-date=13 January 2021 }}</ref> By establishing these clear-cut objectives, the European Commission seeks to foster innovation by promoting new entrants' activities and development over incumbents.<ref name=\":16\"/> On the one hand, the DMA intends to constrain gatekeepers\u2019 range of action, but at the same time it also forces the incumbents to open to competition.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Criteria defining Gatekeepers ===\nGiven the fact that EU competition law can be applied only when anti-competitive practices have been enforced, in the literature was initiated a large debate with regard to the ex-ante regulation. Once the utility and efficiency of the existing tools began to be questioned, the policy discussions held before the release of the Digital Markets Act focused on the identification of Gatekeepers, on setting obligations, and on potential conducts that should be outlawed for Gatekeepers.<ref name=\":20\">{{cite web |last1=Madiega |first1=Tambiama |title=Regulating digital gatekeepers Background on the future digital markets act |url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2020/659397/EPRS_BRI(2020)659397_EN.pdf |website=European Parliament |date=December 2020 |access-date=14 April 2021 |archive-date=5 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210305011107/https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2020/659397/EPRS_BRI(2020)659397_EN.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the same line, scholars came to the conclusion that large online platforms \"operate as digital Gatekeepers between businesses and citizens\".<ref name=\":20\"/> At the moment there is not established a clear definition for this term, but it can be mentioned that it usually refers to \"platforms providing online services (e.g. online marketplaces) or controlling and influencing access to online services ... thereby exercising control over entire ecosystems, with a strong impact on competition and innovation in the digital field\".<ref name=\":20\"/>\n\nUnder these circumstances, right before the adoption of the Digital Services Act, the commission made public its intention to regulate large online platforms for better ensuring that markets influenced by these actors remain fair and competitive. Thus, the European executive aimed to implement an \"ex-ante regulatory instrument\", through the Digital Markets Act (DMA), for tackling the limitations imposed by its current competition rules.<ref name=\":20\"/>\n\nFor classifying platforms as digital Gatekeepers, a combination of quantitative and qualitative conditions is required. On the one hand, quantitative criteria include indicators for \"market shares, number of users affected by platform operations, time users spent on a platform's website, and the platform's annual economic revenue\".<ref name=\":20\"/> Thus, the following aspects are analysed:<ref name=\":20\"/>\n\n*\"The undertaking to which the core platform service(s) belongs has an annual EEA turnover equal to or above EUR 6.5 billion in the last three financial years or has an average market capitalization of EUR 65 billion or higher and provides a core platform service in at least three Member States\".<ref name=\":20\"/>\n*\"It operates a core platform service that serves as an important gateway for business users to reach end-users. The criteria are supposed to be met when the core platform service has more than 45 million monthly active end users established or located in the Union and more than 10.000 yearly active business users established in the Union in the last financial year\".<ref name=\":20\"/>\n*\"It enjoys an entrenched and durable position in its operations, or it is foreseeable that it will enjoy such a position in the near future. Which translates by meeting the thresholds of point 2) in each of the last three financial years\".<ref name=\":20\"/>\n\nOn the other hand, the qualitative criteria are harder to assess, but several variables can be taken into account, such as the ability of a platform to control access or to leverage its dominant position. While large platforms designed as search engines or marketplaces may be identified or referred to as digital Gatekeepers, it is not clear whether companies that have as subject other activities \u2013 travel or music \u2013 can be automatically included in the same category. However, even though the legislative proposal does not mention explicitly the undertakings that meet these thresholds, it is expected that the GAFAM will be subject to the DMA.<ref name=\":20\"/>\n\nAt the same time, it should be specified that through market investigation, even providers of core platform services \u2013 that cover solely a part of the concerned thresholds \u2013 may be identified as Gatekeepers by the commission.<ref name=\":24\">{{cite web |last1=European Commission |title=Digital Markets Act |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en |website=European Commission |date=December 2020 |access-date=14 April 2021 |archive-date=15 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415214016/https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en |url-status=live }}</ref> \"In conducting its assessment, the Commission shall take into account foreseeable developments of these elements.\"\n\n{{blockquote|Where the provider of a core platform service that '''satisfies''' the quantitative thresholds&nbsp;... fails to comply with the investigative measures ordered by the Commission in a significant manner and the failure persists after the provider has been invited to comply within a reasonable time limit and to submit observations, the Commission shall be entitled to designate that provider as a Gatekeeper.<ref name=\":24\"/>\n\nWhere the provider of a core platform service that '''does not satisfy''' the quantitative thresholds&nbsp;... fails to comply with the investigative measures ordered by the Commission in a significant manner and the failure persists after the provider has been invited to comply within a reasonable time limit and to submit observations, the Commission shall be entitled to designate that provider as a Gatekeeper based on facts available.<ref name=\":24\"/>}}\n\nGiven the importance and the innovative character of the DMA proposal, several stakeholders have engaged and proposed scenarios for applying a test with the purpose of identifying digital Gatekeepers. The UK Competition Market Authority came with the suggestion of implementing ex-ante rules for companies known to possess \"strategic market status\". Thus, they proposed three factors to be considered: the size and scale; ability to leverage their market power in other sectors of activity; to hold the position of access point both for consumers and businesses. Furthermore, the Centre on Regulation in Europe published a lengthier and in-depth analysis, according to which ex-ante regulation should be applied if online platforms comply with four cumulative criteria: large size; to occupy a position on which other businesses rely/depend; Gatekeeper position that lasts (due to high entry barriers); Gatekeeper having control over an ecosystem.<ref name=\":20\"/>\n\n== New \"ex ante\" regulations ==\n\n=== General framework ===\nThe Digital Markets Act sets up a list of conducts that should be outlawed, on the one hand, and obligations that platforms identified as Gatekeepers should respect, on the other hand. The list is divided in two different parts, the general blacklisted actions (Article 5) and the case by case assessment that needs to be specified (Article 6).\n\nThe different ways of defining obligations and prohibitions have raised several debates between scholars and stakeholders. Some experts support the approach focused on balancing anti-competitive effects with possible justifications, while others are in favour of banning specific practices from the beginning.<ref name=\":20\"/> De Streel classified the new obligations as concerning the following common areas:<ref name=\":21\">{{Cite web|last=De Streel|first=Alexandre|date=2021-01-19|title=The European proposal for a Digital Markets Act: A first assessment|url=https://cerre.eu/publications/the-european-proposal-for-a-digital-markets-act-a-first-assessment/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-23|website=CERRE|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119152911/https://cerre.eu/publications/the-european-proposal-for-a-digital-markets-act-a-first-assessment/ |archive-date=19 January 2021 }}</ref>\n\n* Transparency in ad intermediation\n* Envelopment through bundling or self-preferencing access platforms and data\n* End-users' and business users' mobility\n* Limitation of unfair practices\n\nThose practices are often derived from the past case-law and are considered unfair by the European Commission.<ref name=\":02\"/> Therefore, this proposal uses \"ex-post\" cases to create new \"ex-ante\" regulations and to tackle the issue from the roots.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n=== Sectors concerned (Core Platforms Services) ===\nThe DMA covers eight different sectors, also known as Core Platforms Services (CPS).

Only 13 actors had at least 3 or more meetings logged on these issues. Google stands out with the most meetings with Microsoft and Facebook trailing close behind.

However, comparing the data obtained on the meetings of the European Commission with the information made available by the other institutions, it can be observed that transparency is even less stringent.\n\n==== Apple ====\nThe new European draft legislation has also targeted Apple's App Store with regard to its practices and preinstalled applications. One of the main changes that will be brought to their current business model is represented by the removal of the \"self-preferencing\" strategy.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite web|last=Potuck|first=Michael|date=15 December 2020|title=New EU legislation targets Apple's App Store practices and preinstalled apps|url=https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/apple-eu-legislation-app-store-changes/|url-status=live|access-date=12 April 2021|website=9to5Mac|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201215170149/https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/apple-eu-legislation-app-store-changes/ |archive-date=15 December 2020 }}</ref> As a result of the proposal on the Digital Markets Act, Apple would be forced to change the manner in which its apps are displayed in the App Store searches, so as to give the chance to smaller developers to have their software downloaded by consumers. Moreover, Apple will have to allow its customers to uninstall preloaded first-party apps from the devices procured. Thus, both Google and Apple will be constrained and their practices more regulated. According to the DMA final proposal, these big tech companies will be compelled to share performance metrics for free with advertisers and publishers.<ref name=\":17\"/>\n\nBefore the official release of the DMA proposal, some companies \u2013 including Apple \u2013 tried to change their anti-competitive behaviour, taking into account the reactions generated by the commission's intent to regulate the digital market. As far as Apple is concerned, in October, a group of French publishers \u2013 led by {{lang|fr|italicno|Alliance de la Presse d'Information G\u00e9n\u00e9rale}} (APIG) \u2013 highlighted its concern with regard to the App Store's terms of service. For example, one of their requirements was related to the economic dependence on Apple \u2013 \"Content publishers are in a situation of absolute economic dependence on Apple for the distribution of their content on the iPhone, since the only store available on this device is the AppStore\". In addition, Apple was criticised for the 30% commission on sales that it makes through apps on the platform, thus the APIG showed its concern vis a vis the further concentration on the market.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stolton|first=Samuel|date=19 November 2020|title=Commission has never evaluated 'deterrence effect' of antitrust fines, auditors say|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/commission-has-never-evaluated-deterrence-effect-of-antitrust-fines-auditors-say/|url-status=live|website=Euractiv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119075904/https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/commission-has-never-evaluated-deterrence-effect-of-antitrust-fines-auditors-say/ |archive-date=19 November 2020 }}</ref> The reaction of Apple to these allegations was focused especially on a reduction of its commission rate to 15% for app developers with less than $1 million in annual net sales, but this did not impede the European Commission to continue advocating for the Digital Markets Act.\n\nSimilar to Google's case, Apple also seeks to limit the influence of the commission and to escape the definition of gatekeeper, so as not to become subject to further obligations. However, as Brussels still wants to outlaw gatekeepers' ability to ban others from accessing their marketplaces, firms like Spotify and Facebook \u2013 that believe Apple has set unfair conditions on those companies' apps within App Store, seem to support the commission's proposal.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kayali|first=Laura|date=29 October 2020|title=Google goes on the offensive against EU platform rules|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/google-battles-against-eu-platform-rules/|url-status=live|access-date=12 April 2021|website=Politico|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101121537/https://www.politico.eu/article/google-battles-against-eu-platform-rules/ |archive-date=1 November 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe strategy of Apple to limit the influence of the DMA is not as clear or well-structured as in Google's case. However, there can be observed some practices engaged in by the company to ensure that its objectives are taken into account by the European officials. According to a research conducted by the Corporate Europe Observatory,<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|date=11 December 2020|title=Big Tech brings out the big guns in fight for future of EU tech regulation|url=https://corporateeurope.org/en/2020/12/big-tech-brings-out-big-guns-fight-future-eu-tech-regulation|url-status=live|access-date=12 April 2021|website=Corporate Europe Observatory|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201213233635/https://corporateeurope.org/en/2020/12/big-tech-brings-out-big-guns-fight-future-eu-tech-regulation |archive-date=13 December 2020 }}</ref> it seems that Apple, Google, and Facebook used to work with several associations that declared themselves independent, without disclosing their linkages. For example, the Center for European Reform has featured on its website a list of its corporate donors \u2013 one of them being Apple \u2013 but Apple does not specify this information on the Transparency Register entry.<ref name=\":18\"/> Under these circumstances, it can be observed the network created around interests' groups, companies, NGOs and think tanks, as all of them seek to shape the legislative process in Brussels in their favour.\n\nWhen it comes to lobby spending, despite the limited and incomplete information, it can be observed that Apple is in the top 30 individual corporate lobby spenders in Brussels, at numbers 16 (with over \u20ac2 million). In comparison with Google, that has allocated a budget of \u20ac8 million, Apple still invests a considerable sum of money on access to European officials, so as to present its demands.<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n==== Meta ====\nConsidering that the Digital Markets Act aims to limit the influence of large companies by allowing alternative players to emerge, Meta has also been targeted by the legislative proposal. As in the other companies' cases, once the DMA is adopted, unfair practices will be highly discouraged and even prohibited, so as to stop the harm they bring to competition.\n\nHowever, apart from Google, Apple, and Amazon, Meta seems to support the EU rules that have been published last year.{{clarify timeframe|reason=Meaning of \"last year\" depends on when you're reading!|date=April 2022}} In its official declarations, Meta claimed that it hopes that the European Union will set boundaries for Apple. Nevertheless, in this context there were not observed solely tensions between the Commission and the Big Tech companies, but even between GAFAM, taking into account their statements and the objectives they advocate for.\n\nThe controversies between Meta and Apple started with the privacy feature used by Apple, that allows consumers to block advertisers from tracking them across different applications. Thus, Meta, a company that earns revenue from advertising, began to retaliate and showed its discontent. It has also added that \"Apple controls an entire ecosystem from device to app store and apps, and uses this power to harm developers and consumers, as well as large platforms like Facebook\".<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|date=15 December 2020|title=Facebook takes swipe at Apple while supporting draft EU rules|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-tech-facebook/facebook-takes-swipe-at-apple-while-supporting-draft-eu-rules-idUSKBN28P2NS|url-status=live|website=Reuters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201215210030/https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-tech-facebook/facebook-takes-swipe-at-apple-while-supporting-draft-eu-rules-idUSKBN28P2NS |archive-date=15 December 2020 }}</ref> The reaction of Apple was quite harsh and accused Meta of \"invasive tracking\".<ref name=\":14\"/> Therefore, the discussions around the Digital Markets Act started to create more tensions between Big Tech firms and to deviate from the scope of the proposal, as the companies focused on criticising their \"competitors\" of illegal practices.<ref>{{Cite web|date=16 December 2020|title=Online giants could face 10% fines under new EU law|url=https://euobserver.com/science/150396|url-status=live|access-date=2 April 2021|website=EU Observer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201216060516/https://euobserver.com/science/150396 |archive-date=16 December 2020 }}</ref>\n\n====Amazon====\nAmazon welcomed the DMA and according to its position,{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} the company has not been as concerned about it as the other GAFAM members.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} This can be explained by the fact that compared to Google's and Apple's case, the Digital Markets Act could affect Amazon only in three aspects:{{original research inline|date=October 2022}}\n\n* Amazon might be obliged to allow business users to offer the same products or services to end-users at prices or conditions that are different from those offered by Amazon (DMA Article 5b)\n* Amazon might be obliged not to use data from competitors that is not public (DMA Article 6a)\n* Amazon might be obliged not to treat the services and the products it offers more favourably (DMA Article 6d)\n\nThe prohibition on using non-public data from competitors it hosts on its platform and the prohibition on ranking its product before the ones offered by competitors may impact Amazon if the proposal for the DMA is adopted under its current form. Moreover, these aspects caused Amazon to negotiate the final version of the regulation, taking into account that it spent \u20ac1.75 million on lobbying practices and that it became a member of several think tanks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Corporate Europe Observatory |title=Big Tech Lobbying Google, Amazon & friends and their hidden influence |url=https://corporateeurope.org/en/2020/09/big-tech-lobbying |date=23 September 2020 |access-date=14 April 2021 |archive-date=14 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414161824/https://corporateeurope.org/en/2020/09/big-tech-lobbying |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Microsoft====\nCompared to other Big Tech firms, Microsoft is the most discreet, as it does not use media or newspapers to express its opinion on the Digital Markets Act. The only thing done in a public manner by Microsoft was to react to the commission's consultations. They suggested that the qualification of platforms as gatekeepers might be determined by using a two-pronged test. On the one hand, it should be assessed the level of market power protected by significant barriers to entry.
