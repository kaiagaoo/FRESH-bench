Behind this development are market forces that encompass (1) important economies of scale on the supply side; (2) strong direct and indirect network effects on the demand-side; (3) data-driven competitive advantage; (4) high rate of innovation; and (5) development of conglomerates that structure entire ecosystems.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|last=De Streel|first=A.|date=2020|title=Digital Markets Act: Making economic regulation of platforms fit for the digital age|url=https://cerre.eu/publications/digital-markets-act-economic-regulation-platforms-digital-age/|url-status=live|publisher=Centre on Regulation in Europe|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124073823/https://cerre.eu/publications/digital-markets-act-economic-regulation-platforms-digital-age/ |archive-date=24 November 2020 }}</ref> In addition, the combination of these elements can lead to market dynamics that follow the \"winner-takes-most\" scenarios.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nDuring the last years, serious concerns have been expressed by authorities across the world with regard to the economic power of some digital giants. In Europe, the European Commission \u2013 backed by years of enforcement experience in EU competition law<ref name=\":02\"/> \u2013 has pointed out that a part of those intermediary platforms may be considered \"Gatekeeper\" or \"structuring platforms\" in their respective market segments.<ref name=\":2\"/> Moreover, it has also expressed the concern that Big Tech companies might unlawfully take advantage of their market and bargaining powers, in order to lock in dominant positions (i.e. in the existing markets), to increase their level of influence, and to obtain leading positions in new sectors of activity. Hence, this can be interpreted as providing unfair advantages to the incumbents present in core and ancillary services, as distorting the competition, and as harming the consumers, in the long run, through either increased prices or reduced options.<ref name=\":2\"/> Under EU competition law, reaching a \"dominant position\" is by no mean considered illegal, nor is the idea of a \"winner takes most\" scenario. However, practices that lock in dominant positions or that impose unfair conditions, terms to third parties might be treated as unlawful.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n== The DMA rules ==\n=== General framework ===\nThe Digital Markets Act sets up a list of conducts that should be outlawed, on the one hand, and obligations that platforms identified as gatekeepers should respect, on the other hand. The list is divided in two different parts, the general blacklisted actions (Article 5) and the case by case assessment that needs to be specified (Article 6).\n\n=== Criteria defining Gatekeepers ===\nThe DMA combines quantitative and qualitative criteria in the process of designating gatekeepers. There are three criteria in the legislation:<ref>{{cite web |url= https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_2349|title= Questions and Answers: Digital Markets Act: Ensuring fair and open digital markets|last= |first= |date= 6 September 2023 |website= European Commission |access-date= 9 October 2023|quote=}}</ref>\n* Criteria relating to the size of the companies: (a) a turnover of the company of at least 7.5 billion euro in the [[European Economic Area]] for three years at least or (b) a market capitalization or equivalent of at least 75 billion euro;\n* Criteria relating to the place of the company in controlling access of other businesses to final customers: the company needs to have (a) more than 45 million monthly active end users in the EU and (b) more than 10,000 yearly active business in the EU; \n* \"An entrenched durable position\" which is a qualitative criterion which the regulator considers met if the numbers of active users in the second criterion are met for three years in a row.\n\n=== Sectors concerned (Core Platforms Services) ===\nThe DMA covers eight different sectors, also known as Core Platforms Services (CPS).

The tensions between Alphabet/Google and the European Union have been generated by sanctions applied to unfair practices related to advertising, mobile operating system, or shopping strategies. Several fines were imposed by the European Commission to Google because of breaches of competition law but taking into account that despite the CJEU's rulings, \"inefficient market outcomes in terms of higher prices, lower quality, less choice and innovation\" still emerged, the DMA aims to better regulate this area.\n\nAs the main focus of the Digital Markets Act is represented by operators that provide search engines, social networks, cloud computing services and operating systems, Google was one of the companies that officially presented its position.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|last=Kelion|first=Leo|date=15 December 2020|title=EU reveals plan to regulate Big Tech|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55318225|url-status=live|access-date=2 April 2021|archive-date=21 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210321200604/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55318225}}</ref> In an interview, Google's President of Business and Operations for the EMEA region Matt Brittin stated that: \"It's so important to get the rules right for European consumers to have more choice, to support the kind of jobs we'll need in the future and to support European businesses.\"<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nEven though not specifically named, Google is one of the companies that will be affected by the stringent rules, because the legislation will be applied to firms with European revenues of at least \u20ac6.5&nbsp;bn or at least 45 million users across Europe.

However, comparing the data obtained on the meetings of the European Commission with the information made available by the other institutions, it can be observed that transparency is even less stringent.\n\nIn October 2023 the [[Federal Cartel Office|German cartel office]] said Alphabet unit Google had agreed to change its user data practices to end a German antitrust investigation aimed at curbing its data-driven market power.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-10-05 |title=Google changes user data practices to end German antitrust probe |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/german-cartel-office-google-users-084130313.html |access-date=2023-10-05 |website=Yahoo Finance |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAlphabet responded by:<ref>https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/complying-with-the-digital-markets-act/</ref>\n*Creating the Data Portability API, an API that allows to transfer content of Chrome browser, Google Maps, Play Store, Google Search, Google Shopping, and YouTube to another service, but is only available in all EEA countries only, and the United Kingdom\n*Added additional data for EEA advertisers.\n*Launching a program to have external payment in Google Play Store.\n*[[Android 14]] supports seamless updating on third-party app stores worldwide.\n*Added a settings panel to unlink data between most Google services.\n*Added EU choice screens to Android, which are randomly ordered\n*Added dedicated chips to link to external services for flights and other stuff\n\n===Amazon===\nAmazon welcomed the DMA and according to its position,{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} the company has not been as concerned about it as the other GAFAM members.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} This can be explained by the fact that compared to Google's and Apple's case, the Digital Markets Act could affect Amazon only in three aspects:{{original research inline|date=October 2022}}\n* Amazon might be obliged to allow business users to offer the same products or services to end-users at prices or conditions that are different from those offered by Amazon (DMA Article 5b)\n* Amazon might be obliged not to use data from competitors that is not public (DMA Article 6a)\n* Amazon might be obliged not to treat the services and the products it offers more favourably (DMA Article 6d)\n\nThe prohibition on using non-public data from competitors it hosts on its platform and the prohibition on ranking its product before the ones offered by competitors may impact Amazon if the proposal for the DMA is adopted under its current form. Moreover, these aspects caused Amazon to negotiate the final version of the regulation, taking into account that it spent \u20ac1.75 million on lobbying practices and that it became a member of several think tanks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Corporate Europe Observatory |date=23 September 2020 |title=Big Tech Lobbying Google, Amazon & friends and their hidden influence |url=https://corporateeurope.org/en/2020/09/big-tech-lobbying |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414161824/https://corporateeurope.org/en/2020/09/big-tech-lobbying |archive-date=14 April 2021 |access-date=14 April 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Apple===\nThe new European draft legislation has also targeted Apple's App Store with regard to its practices and preinstalled applications. One of the main changes that will be brought to their current business model is represented by the removal of the \"self-preferencing\" strategy.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite web|last=Potuck|first=Michael|date=15 December 2020|title=New EU legislation targets Apple's App Store practices and preinstalled apps|url=https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/apple-eu-legislation-app-store-changes/|url-status=live|access-date=12 April 2021|website=9to5Mac|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201215170149/https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/apple-eu-legislation-app-store-changes/ |archive-date=15 December 2020 }}</ref> As a result of the proposal on the Digital Markets Act, Apple would be forced to change the manner in which its apps are displayed in the App Store searches, so as to give the chance to smaller developers to have their software downloaded by consumers. Moreover, Apple will have to allow its customers to uninstall preloaded first-party apps from the devices procured. Thus, both Google and Apple will be constrained and their practices more regulated. According to the DMA final proposal, these big tech companies will be compelled to share performance metrics for free with advertisers and publishers.<ref name=\":17\"/>\n\nBefore the official release of the DMA proposal, some companies \u2013 including Apple \u2013 tried to change their behaviour, taking into account the reactions generated by the commission's intent to regulate the digital market. As far as Apple is concerned, in October, a group of French publishers \u2013 led by {{lang|fr|italicno|Alliance de la Presse d'Information G\u00e9n\u00e9rale}} (APIG) \u2013 highlighted its concern with regard to the App Store's terms of service. For example, one of their requirements was related to the economic dependence on Apple \u2013 \"Content publishers are in a situation of absolute economic dependence on Apple for the distribution of their content on the iPhone, since the only store available on this device is the AppStore\". In addition, Apple was criticised for the 30% commission on sales that it makes through apps on the platform, thus the APIG showed its concern vis a vis the further concentration on the market.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stolton|first=Samuel|date=19 November 2020|title=Commission has never evaluated 'deterrence effect' of antitrust fines, auditors say|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/commission-has-never-evaluated-deterrence-effect-of-antitrust-fines-auditors-say/|url-status=live|website=Euractiv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119075904/https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/commission-has-never-evaluated-deterrence-effect-of-antitrust-fines-auditors-say/ |archive-date=19 November 2020 }}</ref> The reaction of Apple to these allegations was focused especially on a reduction of its commission rate to 15% for app developers with less than $1 million in annual net sales, but this did not impede the European Commission to continue advocating for the Digital Markets Act.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pfau|first=Matthias|date=13 February 2024|title=Apple's malicious compliance: app sideloading will remain impossible on your iPhone|url=https://tuta.com/blog/apple-eu-dma-malicious-compliance|access-date=15 February 2024 }}</ref>\n\nSimilar to Google's case, Apple also seeks to limit the influence of the commission and to escape the definition of gatekeeper, so as not to become subject to further obligations. However, as Brussels still wants to outlaw gatekeepers' ability to ban others from accessing their marketplaces, firms like Spotify and Facebook \u2013 that believe Apple has set unfair conditions on those companies' apps within App Store, seem to support the commission's proposal.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kayali|first=Laura|date=29 October 2020|title=Google goes on the offensive against EU platform rules|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/google-battles-against-eu-platform-rules/|url-status=live|access-date=12 April 2021|website=Politico|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101121537/https://www.politico.eu/article/google-battles-against-eu-platform-rules/ |archive-date=1 November 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe strategy of Apple to limit the influence of the DMA is not as clear or well-structured as in Google's case. However, there can be observed some practices engaged in by the company to ensure that its objectives are taken into account by the European officials. According to a research conducted by the Corporate Europe Observatory,<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|date=11 December 2020|title=Big Tech brings out the big guns in fight for future of EU tech regulation|url=https://corporateeurope.org/en/2020/12/big-tech-brings-out-big-guns-fight-future-eu-tech-regulation|url-status=live|access-date=12 April 2021|website=Corporate Europe Observatory|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201213233635/https://corporateeurope.org/en/2020/12/big-tech-brings-out-big-guns-fight-future-eu-tech-regulation |archive-date=13 December 2020 }}</ref> it seems that Apple, Google, and Facebook used to work with several associations that declared themselves independent, without disclosing their linkages. For example, the Center for European Reform has featured on its website a list of its corporate donors \u2013 one of them being Apple \u2013 but Apple does not specify this information on the Transparency Register entry.<ref name=\":18\"/> Under these circumstances, it can be observed the network created around interests' groups, companies, NGOs and think tanks, as all of them seek to shape the legislative process in Brussels in their favour.\n\nWhen it comes to lobby spending, despite the limited and incomplete information, it can be observed that Apple is in the top 30 individual corporate lobby spenders in Brussels, at numbers 16 (with over \u20ac2 million). In comparison with Google, that has allocated a budget of \u20ac8 million, Apple still invests a considerable sum of money on access to European officials, so as to present its demands.<ref name=\":18\"/>\n\n===ByteDance===\n[[ByteDance]] is the one non-American company on the list of Gatekeepers. Its major service offering is the video hosting social network [[TikTok]].\n\nByteDance responded by launching a Data Portability API for EEA users, later to provide \"increased access\" to the API, improving the Download Your Data tool's speed and adding the ability to partially export TikTok data by allowing selections of categories to export. A webform for future DMA compliance was created.<ref>https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-eu/tiktoks-compliance-with-the-dma</ref>\n\n===Meta===\nConsidering that the Digital Markets Act aims to limit the influence of large companies by allowing alternative players to emerge, Meta has also been targeted by the legislative proposal. As in the other companies' cases, once the DMA is adopted, unfair practices will be highly discouraged and even prohibited, so as to stop the harm they bring to competition.\n\nHowever, apart from Google, Apple, and Amazon, Meta seems to support the EU rules that have been published last year.{{clarify timeframe|reason=Meaning of \"last year\" depends on when you're reading!|date=April 2022}} In its official declarations, Meta claimed that it hopes that the European Union will set boundaries for Apple. Nevertheless, in this context there were not observed solely tensions between the Commission and the Big Tech companies, but even between GAFAM, taking into account their statements and the objectives they advocate for.\n\nThe controversies between Meta and Apple started with the privacy feature used by Apple, that allows consumers to block advertisers from tracking them across different applications.
