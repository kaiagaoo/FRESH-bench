Each member's quota also determines its relative voting power. Thus, financial contributions from member governments are linked to voting power in the organization.<ref name=\"Political Economy of IMF voting\" />\n\nThis system follows the logic of a shareholder-controlled organization: wealthy countries have more say in the making and revision of rules.<ref name=\"chorev\"/> Since decision making at the IMF reflects each member's relative economic position in the world, wealthier countries that provide more money to the IMF have more influence than poorer members that contribute less; nonetheless, the IMF focuses on redistribution.<ref name=\"Political Economy of IMF voting\" />\n\n===Inflexibility of voting power===\nQuotas are normally reviewed every five years and can be increased when deemed necessary by the board of governors. IMF voting shares are relatively inflexible: countries that grow economically have tended to become under-represented as their voting power lags behind.<ref name=\"Lipscy 2015\" /> Currently, reforming the representation of [[developing countries]] within the IMF has been suggested.<ref name=\"Political Economy of IMF voting\" /> These countries' economies represent a large portion of the global economic system but this is not reflected in the IMF's decision-making process through the nature of the quota system. [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues, \"There is a need to provide more effective voice and representation for developing countries, which now represent a much larger portion of world economic activity since 1944, when the IMF was created.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stiglitz and Members of a UN Commission on Financial Experts|first1=Joseph E.|title=The Stiglitz Report: Reforming the International Monetary and Financial Systems in the Wake of the Global Crisis|year=2010|publisher=The New Press|location=New York}}</ref> In 2008, a number of quota reforms were passed including shifting 6% of quota shares to dynamic emerging markets and developing countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Factsheet: IMF Quotas|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/quotas.htm|work=About the IMF|publisher=The International Monetary Fund}}</ref>\n\n===Overcoming borrower/creditor divide===\nThe IMF's membership is divided along income lines: certain countries provide financial resources while others use these resources. Both [[developed country]] \"creditors\" and [[developing country]] \"borrowers\" are members of the IMF. The developed countries provide the financial resources but rarely enter into IMF loan agreements; they are the creditors. Conversely, the developing countries use the lending services but contribute little to the pool of money available to lend because their quotas are smaller; they are the borrowers. Thus, tension is created around governance issues because these two groups, creditors and borrowers, have fundamentally different interests.<ref name=\"Political Economy of IMF voting\" />\n\nThe criticism is that the system of voting power distribution through a quota system institutionalizes borrower subordination and creditor dominance. The resulting division of the IMF's membership into borrowers and non-borrowers has increased the controversy around conditionality because the borrowers are interested in increasing loan access while creditors want to maintain reassurance that the loans will be repaid.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kafka|first1=Alejandre|title=Some IMF Problems after the Committee of Twenty|work=International Financial Policy: Essays in honour of Jaques J.

The new Framework became fully operational in February 2003 and it was applied in the subsequent decisions on Argentina and Brazil.<ref>[https://www.imf.org/external/np/acc/2004/eng/032304.pdf inf.org: \"International Monetary Fund \u2013 Review of Exceptional Access Policy\"], {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508080842/https://www.imf.org/external/np/acc/2004/eng/032304.pdf |date=8 May 2007 }}, 23 March 2004</ref> Its purpose was to place some sensible rules and limits on the way the IMF makes loans to support governments with debt problem\u2014especially in emerging markets\u2014and thereby move away from the bailout mentality of the 1990s. Such a reform was essential for ending the crisis atmosphere that then existed in emerging markets. The reform was closely related to and put in place nearly simultaneously with the actions of several emerging market countries to place [[collective action clause]]s in their bond contracts.\n\nIn 2010, the framework was abandoned so the IMF could make loans to Greece in an unsustainable and political situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economicsone.com/2014/03/25/why-the-imfs-exceptional-access-framework-is-so-important/|title=Why the IMF's Exceptional Access Framework is So Important|first1=John|last1=Taylor|date=26 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=taywsj>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303519404579352883092156074|title=The Wall Street Journal|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=13 February 2014|via=online.wsj.com|last1=Taylor|first1=John B.}}</ref>\n\nThe topic of sovereign debt restructuring was taken up by IMF staff in April 2013 for the first time since 2005, in a report entitled \"Sovereign Debt Restructuring: Recent Developments and Implications for the Fund's Legal and Policy Framework\".<ref name=\"imf.org\"/> The paper, which was discussed by the board on 20 May,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> summarised the recent experiences in Greece, St Kitts and Nevis, Belize, and Jamaica.

The [[Group of 24]] (G-24), on behalf of LDC members, and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) complained that the IMF did not distinguish sufficiently between disequilibria with predominantly external as opposed to internal causes. This criticism was voiced in the aftermath of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Then LDCs found themselves with payment deficits due to adverse changes in their [[terms of trade]], with the Fund prescribing stabilization programmes similar to those suggested for deficits caused by government over-spending. Faced with long-term, externally generated disequilibria, the G-24 argued for more time for LDCs to adjust their economies.\n* Some IMF policies may be anti-developmental; the report said that [[deflationary]] effects of IMF programmes quickly led to losses of output and employment in economies where incomes were low and unemployment was high. Moreover, the burden of the deflation is disproportionately borne by the poor.\n* The IMF's initial policies were based in theory and influenced by differing opinions and departmental rivalries.

Caught in the debt's downward spiral, developing countries soon had no other recourse than to take on new debt in order to repay the old debt. Before providing them with new loans, at higher interest rates, future leaders asked the IMF, to intervene with the guarantee of ulterior reimbursement, asking for a signed agreement with the said countries. The IMF  thus agreed to restart the flow of the 'finance pump' on condition that the concerned countries first use this money to reimburse banks and other private lenders, while restructuring their economy at the IMF's discretion: these were the famous conditionalities, detailed in the Structural Adjustment Programmes. The IMF and its ultra-liberal experts took control of the borrowing countries' economic policies. A new form of colonisation was thus instituted. It was not even necessary to establish an administrative or military presence; the debt alone maintained this new form of submission.<ref>{{cite book|last=Toussaint and Millet|title=Debt, The IMF, and The world Bank|year=2010|publisher=Monthly Review Press U.S.|pages=83}}</ref>}}\n\nInternational politics play an important role in IMF decision making. The clout of member states is roughly proportional to its contribution to IMF finances. The United States has the greatest number of votes and therefore wields the most influence.
