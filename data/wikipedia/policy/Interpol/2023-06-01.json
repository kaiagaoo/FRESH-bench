Its broad mandate covers virtually every kind of crime, including [[crimes against humanity]], [[child pornography]], [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] and production, [[political corruption]], [[intellectual property infringement]], as well as [[white-collar crime]]. The agency also facilitates cooperation among national law enforcement institutions through criminal databases and communications networks. Contrary to popular belief, Interpol is itself not a law enforcement agency.\n\nInterpol has an annual budget of \u20ac142 million, most of which comes from annual contributions by member police forces in 181 countries. It is governed by a General Assembly composed of all member countries, which elects the executive committee and the President (currently [[Ahmed Naser Al-Raisi]] of the [[United Arab Emirates]]) to supervise and implement Interpol's policies and administration. Day-to-day operations are carried out by the General Secretariat, comprising around 1,000 personnel from over 100 countries, including both police and civilians. The Secretariat is led by the Secretary-General, currently [[J\u00fcrgen Stock]], the former deputy head of Germany's [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office]].\n\nPursuant to its [[Constitution|charter]], Interpol seeks to remain [[Politically Neutral|politically neutral]] in fulfilling its mandate, and is thus barred from interventions or activities that are political, military, religious, or racial in nature and from involving itself in disputes over such matters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Legal-materials/Neutrality-Article-3-of-the-Constitution|title=Neutrality (Article 3 of the Constitution)|publisher=INTERPOL|access-date=31 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331115209/https://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Legal-materials/Neutrality-Article-3-of-the-Constitution|archive-date=31 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The agency operates in four languages: Arabic, English, French and Spanish.<ref name=\"General Secretariat\" />\n\n== History ==\nUntil the nineteenth century, cooperation among police in different national and political jurisdictions was organized largely on an ''ad hoc'' basis, focused on a specific goal or criminal enterprise. The earliest attempt at a formal, permanent framework for international police coordination was the Police Union of German States, formed in 1851 to bring together police from various German-speaking states. Its activities were centered mostly on political dissidents and criminals. A similar plan was launched by Italy in the [[International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists|1898 Anti-Anarchist Conference of Rome]], which brought delegates from twenty-one European countries to create a formal structure for addressing the international anarchist movement. Neither the conference nor its follow up meeting in St. Petersburg in 1904 yielded results.\n\n[[File:ICPO-Interpol Lione.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Interpol headquarters in the [[6th arrondissement of Lyon]], France]]\nThe early 20th century saw several more efforts to formalize international police cooperation, as growing international travel and commerce facilitated transnational criminal enterprises and fugitives of the law.<ref name=\"Deflem1\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3115142| jstor = 3115142| url=https://deflem.blogspot.com/2000/12/bureaucratization-and-social-control.html|title = Bureaucratization and Social Control: Historical Foundations of International Police Cooperation| journal = Law & Society Review| volume = 34| issue = 3| pages = 739\u2013778| year = 2000| last1 = Deflem | first1 = M. }}</ref> The earliest was the International Criminal Police Congress hosted by [[Monaco]] in 1914, which brought police and legal officials from two dozen countries to discuss international cooperation in investigating crimes, sharing investigative techniques, and extradition procedures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interpol.int/Who-we-are/Our-history/12-wishes-then-and-now|title=12 wishes: then and now|website=www.interpol.int}}</ref> The Monaco Congress laid out twelve principles and priorities that would eventually become foundational to Interpol, including providing direct contact between police in different nations; creating an international standard for forensics and data collection; and facilitating the efficient processing of extradition requests. The idea of an international police organization remained dormant due to the First World War. The United States attempted to lead a similar effort in 1922 through the International Police Conference in New York City, but it failed to attract international attention.<ref name=\"Deflem12\">{{Cite journal|last1=Deflem|first1=M.|year=2000|title=Bureaucratization and Social Control: Historical Foundations of International Police Cooperation|url=https://deflem.blogspot.com/2000/12/bureaucratization-and-social-control.html|journal=Law & Society Review|volume=34|issue=3|pages=739\u2013778|doi=10.2307/3115142|jstor=3115142}}</ref>\n\nA year later, in 1923, a new initiative was undertaken at another International Criminal Police Congress in [[Vienna]], spearheaded by [[Johannes Schober]], President of the Viennese Police Department. The 22 delegates agreed to found the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC), the direct forerunner of Interpol, which would be based in Vienna.
