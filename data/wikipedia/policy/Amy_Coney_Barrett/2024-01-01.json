On the merits, Barrett departed from her colleagues Wood and Rovner, who held that DHS's interpretation of that provision was unreasonable under ''[[Chevron deference|Chevron]]'' Step Two.

Barrett declined to address whether the husband had been denied a constitutional right (or whether the constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse existed at all) because the consular officer's decision to deny the visa application was [[Facial challenge|facially]] legitimate and bona fide, and under Supreme Court precedent, in such a case courts will not \"look behind the exercise of that discretion\". The dispute concerned what it takes to satisfy this standard. A petition for rehearing ''[[en banc]]'' was denied, with Chief Judge Wood, joined by Rovner and Hamilton, dissenting.

They included ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'' ([[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporating]] the Fourth Amendment onto the states),<ref name=\"Barrett-2013\">{{cite journal |last=Barrett |first=Amy C. |title=Precedent and Jurisprudential Disagreement |date=August 22, 2013 |url=http://texaslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Barrett.pdf |journal=Texas Law Review |volume=91 |issue=7 |pages=1711, 1734\u201335|access-date=September 26, 2020|archive-date=July 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200721112732/http://texaslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Barrett.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> but specifically excluded ''Roe v. Wade'' (1973). In explaining why it was excluded, Barrett referenced scholarship agreeing that in order to qualify as \"superprecedent\", a decision must have widespread support from not only [[jurist]]s but politicians and the public at large to the extent of becoming immune to reversal or challenge (for example, the [[legal tender cases|constitutionality of paper money]]). She argued that the people must trust a ruling's validity to such an extent that the matter has been taken \"off of the Court's agenda\", with lower courts no longer taking challenges to them seriously. Barrett pointed to ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992) as evidence that ''Roe'' had not attained this status, and quoted Richard H. Fallon Jr.: \"[A] decision as fiercely and enduringly contested as ''Roe v. Wade'' has acquired no immunity from serious judicial reconsideration, even if arguments for overruling it ought not succeed.\"<ref name=\"Barrett-2013\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fallon |first1=Richard H.

Gerhardt also found that during the Rehnquist Court's last 11 years, the average number of times a justice called for the overruling of precedent was higher for textualist justices, with one per year coming from Ginsburg (non-textualist) up to just over two per year from Thomas (textualist). Gerhardt wrote that not all the calls for overruling were related to textualism issues, and that one must be careful in the inferences one draws from the numbers, which \"do not indicate either why or on what basis the justices urged overruling.\"<ref name=\"Barrett-2013\"/>\n\n=== Affordable Care Act ===\nIn 2012, Barrett signed a letter criticizing the Obama administration's approach to providing employees of religious institutions with [[birth control]] coverage without having the religious institutions pay for it, calling it an \"assault\" to religious liberty.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBarrett has been critical of the majority opinion written by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] in ''[[National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius]]'' (2012), which upheld the constitutionality of the [[Affordable Care Act]]'s [[individual mandate]]. She wrote in 2017: \"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did\u2014as a penalty\u2014he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\"<ref name=\"majoritarian\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{cite news |title=Who Is Amy Coney Barrett, Front-Runner For The Supreme Court Nomination? |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/09/24/915781077/conenator-who-is-amy-coney-barrett-front-runner-for-supreme-court-nomination|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925002352/https://www.npr.org/2020/09/24/915781077/conenator-who-is-amy-coney-barrett-front-runner-for-supreme-court-nomination|archive-date=September 25, 2020|access-date=September 25, 2020 |publisher=[[NPR]]}}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{cite news |last1=Wolf |first1=Richard |last2=Groppe |first2=Maureen |date=September 27, 2020 |title=On key issues: Statements and rulings by Amy Coney Barrett |url=https://www.southbendtribune.com/story/news/local/2020/09/23/on-key-issues-statements-and-rulings-by-amy-coney-barre/43954211/ |access-date=September 27, 2020 |work=[[South Bend Tribune]] |archive-date=September 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925204210/https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/on-key-issues-statements-and-rulings-by-amy-coney-barrett/article_853864c0-fbbc-11ea-9c8b-8b2b07717d56.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keith|first=Katie|date=20 September 2020|title=After Justice Ginsburg's Loss, What A New Court Could Mean For The ACA|url=https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20200920.954961/full/|doi=10.1377/forefront.20200920.954961|journal=Health Affairs Forefront}}</ref>\n\n=== Abortion ===\nBarrett [[anti-abortion|opposes abortion]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Liptak |first1=Adam |author-link1=Adam Liptak |title=Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's Supreme Court Pick, Signed Anti-Abortion Ad |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/amy-coney-barrett-abortion.html |access-date=October 3, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 1, 2020 |archive-date=October 2, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002233802/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/amy-coney-barrett-abortion.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |first=Colby |last=Itkowitz |year=2020 |title=Who is Amy Coney Barrett, the judge at the top of Trump's list to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg? |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/19/who-is-amy-coney-barrett/ |quote=is fervently antiabortion |access-date=October 1, 2020 |archive-date=October 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001003446/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/19/who-is-amy-coney-barrett/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2006, she signed an advertisement placed by St. Joseph County Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, in a [[South Bend, Indiana]], newspaper.
