The classification determines the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) authority over ISPs: the FCC would have significant ability to regulate ISPs if classified as common carriers, but would have little control over them if classified as information services. Because the Communications Act has not been amended by Congress to account for ISPs, the FCC has the authority to designate how ISPs are classified, as affirmed by the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in the case ''[[National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services]]'' (2005), in addition to choosing what regulations to set on common carriers. The five member FCC commission changes with each new administration, and no more than three members may be of the same political party, thus the FCC's attitudes and rule-making regarding net neutrality shifts relatively frequently.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the FCC adopted a position that ISPs were Title I information services, and proposed net neutrality principles via the [[FCC Open Internet Order 2010]]. Courts ruled in ''[[Comcast v. FCC]]'' (2010) and ''[[Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC (2014)|Verizon v. FCC]]'' (2014) that the FCC was not authorized to enforce these net neutrality principles on Title I information services. Under FCC chair [[Tom Wheeler]], the FCC voted in the 2015 FCC open order to categorize ISPs as Title II common carriers and thus subject to net neutrality principles, which was upheld after a legal challenge raised by the ISP industry in ''[[United States Telecom Association v. FCC (2016)|United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC]]'' in 2016.\n\nDuring the [[First presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]], in 2017, the FCC reverted to handling ISPs as Title I information services with some court-mandated leeway being given to state-level legislation. In July 2021, President [[Joe Biden]] called for the FCC to undo some of these changes. In April 2024, the FCC voted 3-2 to restore net neutrality rules and regulation of Internet service providers.<ref name=\"fcc-oct-2023\">{{cite news |last1=Brodkin |first1=John |title=FCC moves ahead with Title II net neutrality rules in 3-2 party-line vote |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/fcc-moves-ahead-with-title-ii-net-neutrality-rules-in-3-2-party-line-vote/ |access-date=19 October 2023 |work=Ars Technica |date=19 October 2023}}</ref><ref name=\"verge April 2024\">{{Cite web |last=Feiner |first=Lauren |date=2024-04-25 |title=FCC votes to restore net neutrality |url=https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24140157/fcc-vote-restore-net-neutrality-rosenworcel-biden |access-date=2024-04-28 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fung |first1=Brian |title=Net neutrality is back as FCC votes to regulate internet providers |work=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=April 25, 2024 |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/25/tech/net-neutrality-is-back/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240712180127/https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/25/tech/net-neutrality-is-back/index.html |archive-date=July 12, 2024}}</ref> In August 2024 a Federal court again blocked net neutrality rules.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shepardson |first1=David |title=US court blocks Biden administration net neutrality rules |url=https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-court-blocks-biden-administration-net-neutrality-rules-2024-08-01/ |website=Reuters |access-date=21 August 2024}}</ref>\n\n==Regulatory history==\n===Early history 1980 \u2013 early 2000s===\n{{Timeline of release years\n| title = Major events related to net neutrality in the United States\n| subtitle = Red: [[Presidency of George W.

Services such as telegrams and the phone network (officially, the [[public switched telephone network]] or PSTN) have been considered [[common carrier]]s under U.S. law since the [[Mann\u2013Elkins Act|Mann\u2013Elkins Act of 1910]], which means that they have been akin to [[public utilities]] and expressly forbidden to give preferential treatment. The [[Communications Act of 1934]] created the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to regulate the industry and ensure fair pricing and access.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-12-92A1.pdf|title=Report and order|website=fcc.gov|access-date=26 September 2023}}</ref> Different titles of the Act covered different modes of communication, but primary focus on the debate of net neutrality has been on Titles I and II. The Act distinguished between common carriers, who were bound under Title II of the Act, and other telecommunication systems of the time, covered broadly under Title I. Within Title II, common carriers such as the phone networks were to be regulated by the FCC as to assure reasonable pricing rates and non-discriminatory practices. Systems under Title I were left to be unregulated by the FCC.\n\nIn the late 1980s the Internet became legally available for commercial use, and in the early years of public use of the Internet, this was its main use \u2013 public access was limited and largely reached through [[dial-up modem]]s (as was the [[Bulletin board system]] dial-up culture that preceded it). The Internet was viewed more as a commercial service than a domestic and societal system. However, by the late 1990s and early 2000s, [[Internet in the United States|the Internet started to become common]] in households and wider society. Also in the 1980s, arguments about the public interest requirements of the telecommunications industry in the U.S. arose; whether companies involved in broadcasting were best viewed as community [[trustees]], with obligations to society and consumers, or mere [[Market (economics)|market]] participants with obligations only to their shareholders.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/abstracts/Volume%2060/Fowler.htm Mark S.

Brand X Internet Services}}\nIn the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the introduction of \"information services\" under Title I prompted many cable-based Internet access providers to urge the FCC to classify their services as Title I information services, rather than as cable providers under the Act's Title III which required them to provide open access to other service provides. The FCC took in comments, and after providing its initial findings in 2002, issued \"Inquiry Concerning High-Speed Access to the Internet over Cable and Other Facilities\" in which it had determined that cable ISPs were neither a telecommunications provider (under Title II) nor a cable provider (under Title III) but were solely an information service that fell under Title I and thus could operate unregulated by the FCC.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Aronowitz | first = Steven  | title = Brand X Internet Services v.

The cases were consolidated to the [[Ninth Circuit]]. In May 2003, the Ninth Circuit vacated the FCC's ruling, stating that cable ISPs had a telecommunications function and thus should be regulated under Title II. The [[NCTA (association)|National Cable & Telecommunications Association]] challenged the ruling, and while the Ninth Circuit refused to rehear the case ''en banc'', the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. The Court announced its judgment in June 2005. The 6\u20133 decision reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling, deeming that the FCC had properly defined cable ISPs as an information service.

Powell recognized that it was still early to have a clear picture of what government regulation should be for net neutrality, but agreed that based on practices of broadband operators of the past few years, it was necessary to establish what rights consumers should expect from broadband service. In a speech at the Silicon Flatirons Symposium, Powell encouraged ISPs to offer users these four freedoms:<ref name=\"Powell Principles\">{{cite web |author=Powell, Michael |author-link=Michael Powell (attorney) |title=Preserving Internet Freedom: Guiding Principles for the Industry |url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-243556A1.pdf |date=February 8, 2004 |access-date=July 7, 2006 |archive-date=May 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519220745/http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-243556A1.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n# Freedom to access content - Consumers should have access to their choice of legal content\n# Freedom to run applications - Consumers should be able to run applications of their choice\n# Freedom to attach devices - Consumers should be permitted to attach any devices they choose to the connection in their homes\n# Freedom to obtain service plan information - Consumers should receive meaningful information regarding their service plans\n\nIn early 2005, in the ''Madison River'' case, the FCC for the first time showed the willingness to enforce its network neutrality principles by opening an investigation about Madison River Communications, a local telephone carrier that was blocking [[Vonage]]'s [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) service in its [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) offering to customers. At the time, while the FCC classified cable providers under Title I as an information provider (as per the ''Brand X'' case) and were unregulated, services such as DSL were still considered under Title II as a common carrier, and were bound by non-discriminatory regulation from the FCC.<ref name=\"btlj madison\"/> Nevertheless, the FCC's investigation led to a settlement between the FCC and Madison River Communications before any further litigation occurred, with Madison River agreeing to stop blocking VoIP traffic and paying a {{USD|15,000|long=no}} fine.<ref>{{cite web |title=In the Matter of Madison River Communications, LLC and affiliated companies |url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-05-543A2.pdf |work=Consent Decree DA 05-543 |publisher=FCC |access-date=April 30, 2014 |year=2005 |archive-date=December 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208120436/http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-05-543A2.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> While the action did not set any precedent for the FCC's stance on net neutrality, the Madison River case was an indication the agency was willing to uphold Powell's principles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-05-543A2.pdf%7Cformat%3DPDF |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213153816/https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-05-543A2.pdf%7Cformat=PDF |archive-date=February 13, 2018 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Shortly after the case was settled, the FCC issued a new rule in 2005 to reclassified DSL as a Title I information service and allowing them to operate unregulated by the FCC.<ref>Appropriate Framework for Broadband Access to the Internet Over Wireline Facilities, Federal Communications Commission, {{Federal Register|70|60222}} (October 17, 2005)</ref><ref name=\"btlj madison\">{{cite journal | last = Reicher | first=  Alexander | title = Redefining Net Neutrality After Comcast v.

FCC'' in March 2010, the FCC amended these rules to account for the court's decision. The FCC voted in December 2010 to approve the FCC Open Internet Order banning cable television and telephone service providers from preventing access to competitors or certain web sites. The order established six net \"neutrality principles\" that would apply to ISPs:\n\n* Transparency: Consumers and innovators have a right to know the basic performance characteristics of their Internet access and how their network is being managed;\n* No blocking: This includes a right to send and receive lawful traffic, prohibits the blocking of lawful content, apps, services and the connection of non-harmful devices to the network;\n* Level playing field: Consumers and innovators have a right to a level playing field. This means a ban on unreasonable content discrimination. There is no approval for so-called \"pay for priority\" arrangements involving fast lanes for some companies but not others;\n* Network management: This is an allowance for broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management. These rules do not forbid providers from offering subscribers tiers of services or charging based on bandwidth consumed;\n* Mobile: The provisions adopted today do not apply as strongly to mobile devices, though some provisions do apply. Of those that do are the broadly applicable rules requiring transparency for mobile broadband providers and prohibiting them from blocking websites and certain competitive applications;\n* Vigilance: The order creates an open Internet advisory committee to assist the commission in monitoring the state of Internet openness and the effects of the rules.<ref name=\"wired 2010 order\">{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/12/fcc-order/ |magazine=Wired |first=Sam |last=Gustin |title=FCC Passes Compromise Net Neutrality Rules |date=December 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe 2010 orders did not reclassify ISPs under Title II common carriers, leaving them unregulated by the FCC under Title I information services as a cumulative result of past FCC orders.<ref name=\"wired 2010 order\"/> The measure was denounced by net neutrality advocates as a capitulation to telecommunication companies such as allowing them to discriminate on transmission speed for their profit, especially on mobile devices like the [[iPad]], while pro-business advocates complained about any regulation of the Internet at all.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/12/22/1881959/fcc-adopts-web-rules.html |title=FCC adopts web rules |last=Bartash |first=Jeffry |work=[[MarketWatch]]|date=December 22, 2010 |access-date=December 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717035844/http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/12/22/1881959/fcc-adopts-web-rules.html |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.care2.com/causes/politics/blog/fcc-adopts-net-neutrality-rules/ |title=FCC Adopts Net Neutrality Rules |publisher=Care2.com |date=December 21, 2010 |access-date=January 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/21/AR2010122106110.html |title=FCC Approves Net-Neutrality Rules; Criticism is Immediate |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 22, 2010 |access-date=September 23, 2011 |first=Cecilia |last=Kang|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905161027/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/21/AR2010122106110.html|archive-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====''Verizon v. FCC'' (2014)====\n{{main|Verizon Communications Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission (2014)}}\nWhile the 2010 Open Internet Order was generally favorable to ISPs, the issuing of the neutrality principles that would still apply to Title I information services was criticized by some ISPs. [[Verizon Communications]] challenged the order at the [[D.C. Circuit]] court in early 2011, asserting that the FCC had overstepped its authority by applying principles to Title I information services. The D.C. Circuit ruled in January 2014 to vacate the blocking and discrimination principles from the 2010 Open Internet Order while upholding other parts. The decision determined that the FCC improperly relied on Section 706 of the amended Communications Act, which gives the FCC authority to incentivize the deployment of telecommunications services to all Americans including those in rural and low-income areas. The FCC had relied on Section 706's language that they had authority to \"promulgate rules governing broadband providers\u2019 treatment of Internet traffic\" to apply these rules to Title I information services. The Court ruled that ISPs were still specifically treated as Title I information services by the FCC, and for the FCC to be able to regulate aspects like blocking or discrimination, they would specifically have to be cataloged as telecommunication common carriers under Title II. The court agreed that FCC can regulate broadband in a general manner and may craft more specific rules that stop short of identifying service providers as common carriers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Brodkin |first=Jon |title=Net neutrality is half-dead: Court strikes down FCC's anti-blocking rule |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/01/net-neutrality-is-half-dead-court-strikes-down-fccs-anti-blocking-rules/|access-date=January 14, 2014|date=January 14, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Robertson |first=Adi |title=Federal court strikes down FCC net neutrality rules |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/14/5307650/federal-court-strikes-down-net-neutrality-rules |website=[[The Verge]]|access-date=January 14, 2014|date=January 14, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Wright | first = Christopher J.  | title = The Scope of the FCC's Ancillary Jurisdiction after the DC Crcuit's Net Neutrality Decisions. | journal = [[Federal Communications Law Journal]] | volume = 67 | year =2014 | pages = 19\u201340 }}</ref>\n\nAs a response to the DC Circuit Court's decision, a dispute developed as to whether net neutrality could be guaranteed under existing law, or if reclassification of ISPs was needed to ensure net neutrality.<ref name=dispute >{{cite news |last=Berkman |first=Fran |date=May 20, 2014 |title=Title II is the key to net neutrality\u2014so what is it? |url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/what-is-title-ii-net-neutrality-fcc/ |newspaper=The Daily Dot|access-date=November 13, 2014}}</ref> Wheeler stated that the FCC had the authority under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to regulate ISPs, while others, including President Obama,<ref>{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Edward |date=November 10, 2014 |title=Obama Asks F.C.C. to Adopt Tough Net Neutrality Rules |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/technology/obama-net-neutrality-fcc.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=November 13, 2014}}</ref> supported reclassifying ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the [[Communications Act of 1934]].

Debate over the issue predates the coining of the term. Advocates of net neutrality have raised concerns about the ability of broadband providers to use their [[Last mile (telecommunications)|last mile]] infrastructure to block Internet applications and content (e.g. websites, services, and protocols), and even to block out competitors.<ref>Lessig, L. 1999.

Restrictions on offering a data fast lane will be enforced between content providers and ISPs to avoid unfair advantages. This hybrid proposal has become the most popular solution among the three options that FCC has reported.

Section 201(b) of the Act, which was cited as an argument by the Commission but not addressed by the Court on procedural grounds, could grant the Commission authority to regulate broadband Internet services where they render \"charges, practices and regulations for, and in connection with\" common carrier services unjust and unreasonable.\"<ref name=\"papers.ssrn.com\"/> Secondly, she suggests, it is \"''undesirable and premature'' to legislatively mandate network neutrality or for the Commission to adopt a paternalistic approach on the issue ... [as] there have been few overt incidents to date, and the costs of those incidents to consumers have been limited.\"<ref name=\"papers.ssrn.com\"/> She cites \"''prompt media attention and public backlash''\" as effective policing tools to prevent ISPs from throttling traffic. She suggests that it \"would be more prudent to consider introducing modest [[consumer protection]] rules, such as requiring ISPs to disclose their network management practices and to allow for consumers to switch ISPs inexpensively, rather than introducing network neutrality laws.\"<ref name=\"papers.ssrn.com\"/> \"While by regulating broadband services the commission is not directly regulating content and applications on the Internet\", content will be affected by the reclassification. \"The different layers of the Internet work in tandem with each other such that there is no possibility of throttling or improving one layer's performance without impacting the other layers. ...
