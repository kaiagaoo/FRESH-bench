Prior to enactment of the Act, [[American Samoa]] was the only U.S. territory which [[Same-sex marriage in American Samoa|neither performed nor recognized same-sex marriages]], even if performed legally in another jurisdiction of the United States or elsewhere. It does not apply to [[Same-sex marriage in tribal nations in the United States|federally-recognized Native American nations]], which are free to determine their own policy on performance and recognition. \n\n=== Choice of law problem ===\nIn addition to repealing DOMA, the legislation would establish a method for the federal government to determine whether a marriage is valid for federal purposes, a legal dilemma known as [[choice of laws]]. Anticipating that federal courts and administrators would need to determine the validity ''for federal purposes'' of a marriage that is recognized in one state and not another, or in a foreign country and not by every U.S. state, it creates two tests. If celebrated in a state of the U.S. (with \"state\" interpreted to include territories and the District of Columbia), a marriage is valid for federal purposes if valid in that state. If celebrated elsewhere, a marriage is valid for federal purposes if it is valid in at least one U.S. state.<ref name=baude>{{cite journal|first=William|last=Baude|title=Beyond DOMA: Choice of State Law in Federal Statutes|journal=[[Stanford Law Review]]|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|location=Stanford, California|volume=64|date=June 2012|pages=1371\u20131430|url=http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/sites/default/files/Baude-64-Stan-L-Rev-1371.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220719234455/https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/?webauth-document=Baude-64-Stan-L-Rev-1371.pdf |archive-date=July 19, 2022|access-date=July 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nLegal scholars disputed whether the language of the Respect for Marriage Act was an appropriate solution to the problem.
