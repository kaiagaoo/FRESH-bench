written by the REPEAT Project, a partnership between the Evolved Energy Research firm and [[Princeton University]]'s ZERO Lab, said the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act alone will make only a small reduction in emissions, but as they say:<ref>{{cite report |url=https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_Preliminary_Report_102021.pdf |title=Preliminary Report: The Climate Impact of Congressional Infrastructure and Budget Bills |date=20 October 2021 |publisher=Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit |page=9 |access-date=26 January 2022

modeling capabilities to reflect the net effect of surface transportation investments in highways (which tend to increase on-road vehicle and freight miles traveled) and rail and public transit (which tend to reduce on-road vehicle and freight miles traveled). These significant programs are therefore not modeled in this analysis, an important limitation of our assessment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.</blockquote>The Georgetown Climate Center tried to estimate how the $599 billion investment for surface transportation in the law can impact emissions from transportation. It created two scenarios: \"high emissions\" and \"low emissions\". In the first scenario, from the money dedicated to highways, more money will go to building new highways, while in the second, more will go to repairing existing highways. The other spending areas characteristics are not so different. The first scenario sees increased cumulative emissions over the years 2022\u20132040 by more than 200 million tons, while the second decreases them by around 250 million tons.<ref>{{cite web |title=Issue Brief: Estimating the Greenhouse Gas Impact of Federal Infrastructure Investments in the IIJA |url=https://www.georgetownclimate.org/articles/federal-infrastructure-investment-analysis.html |website=Georgetown climate center |date=16 October 2021|access-date=27 November 2023}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2022, the [[Boston Consulting Group]] analyzed the Act and found $41 billion of it would be spent on energy projects germane to climate action, $18 billion on similarly germane transportation projects, $18 billion on \"clean tech\" intended to cut hard-to-abate emissions, $0 on manufacturing, and $34 billion on other climate action provisions.<ref name=\"BCG 2022-08-16\" />\n\nThe law includes the largest federal investment in [[public transit]] in history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/ |website=The White House |date=November 6, 2021 |access-date=26 January 2022 |archive-date=January 26, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220126170901/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The law includes spending figures of $105 billion in public transport.
