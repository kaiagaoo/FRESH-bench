ZERO Lab, said the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act alone will make only a small reduction in emissions, but as they say: \"We lack modeling capabilities to reflect the net effect of surface transportation investments in highways (which tend to increase on-road vehicle and freight miles traveled) and rail and public transit (which tend to reduce on-road vehicle and freight miles traveled). These significant programs are therefore not modeled in this analysis, an important limitation of our assessment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Preliminary Report: The Climate Impact of Congressional Infrastructure and Budget Bills |date=20 October 2021 |publisher=Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit|page=9 |url=https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_Preliminary_Report_102021.pdf |access-date=26 January 2022 |archive-date=October 20, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211020161736/https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_Preliminary_Report_102021.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Georgetown Climate Center tried to estimate how the $599 billion investment for surface transportation in the bill can impact emissions from transportation. It created two scenarios: \"high emissions\" and \"low emissions\". The main difference is that, from the money dedicated to highways in the first scenario, more money will go to building new highways, while in the second, more will go to repairing existing highways. The other spending areas' characteristics are not so different. The first scenario sees increased cumulative emissions over the years 2022-2040 by more than 200 million tons, while the second decreases them by around 250 million tons.<ref>{{cite web |title=Issue Brief: Estimating the Greenhouse Gas Impact of Federal Infrastructure Investments in the IIJA |url=https://www.georgetownclimate.org/articles/federal-infrastructure-investment-analysis.html |website=Georgetown climate center |date=16 October 2021|access-date=27 November 2023}}</ref>\n\nThe law includes the largest federal investment in [[public transit]] in history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/ |website=The White House |date=November 6, 2021 |access-date=26 January 2022 |archive-date=January 26, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220126170901/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The law includes spending figures of $105 billion in public transport.
