The Congress had no power to [[tax levies|levy]] and [[tax collector|collect]] taxes, nor was there a tangible basis for securing funds from foreign investors or governments. The delegates resolved to issue paper money in the form of [[bills of credit]], promising [[fiat money|redemption]] in [[coin]] on faith in the revolutionary cause. On June 22, 1775, only a few days after the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], the Continental Congress issued $2&nbsp;million in bills; on July 25, 28 citizens of Philadelphia were employed by Congress to sign and number the currency.\n\nOn July 29, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] assigned the responsibility for the administration of the revolutionary government's finances to joint Continental treasurers [[George Clymer]] and [[Michael Hillegas]]. Congress stipulated that each of the colonies contribute to the Continental government's funds. To ensure proper and efficient handling of the growing [[national debt]] in the face of weak economic and political ties between the colonies, the Congress, on February 17, 1776, designated a committee of five to superintend the treasury, [[settlement (finance)|settle accounts]], and report periodically to the Congress. On April 1, a Treasury Office of Accounts, consisting of an auditor general and [[clerk]]s, was established to facilitate the settlement of claims and to keep the public accounts for the government of the United Colonies. With the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 4, 1776, the newborn republic as a [[sovereign nation]] was able to secure loans from abroad.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Banks and Politics in America: From the Revolution to the Civil War|last=Hammond|first=Bray|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1957|location=Princeton, NJ}}</ref>\n\nDespite the infusion of foreign and domestic loans, the [[Thirteen Colonies|united colonies]] were unable to establish a well-organized agency for financial administration. Michael Hillegas was first called Treasurer of the United States on May 14, 1777. The Treasury Office was reorganized three times between 1778 and 1781. The $241.5&nbsp;million in paper Continental bills [[devaluation|devalued]] rapidly. By May 1781, the dollar [[hyperinflation|collapsed]] at a rate of from 500 to 1000 to 1 against [[hard currency]]. Protests against the worthless money swept the colonies, giving rise to the expression \"[[early American currency#Continental currency|not worth a Continental]]\". The office has, since the late 18th century, been [[British English|customarily referred]] to as the singular \"Treasury\", without any [[Article (grammar)|preceding article]], as a remnant of the country's transition from [[British English|British]] to [[American English]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3NUAAAAYAAJ|title=Reports of the secretary of the Treasury of the United States: prepared in obedience to the act of May 10, 1800|date=1851|publisher=Printed by Blair & Rives|language=en|access-date=April 27, 2020|archive-date=December 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231213050157/https://books.google.com/books?id=s3NUAAAAYAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Dewey|first=Davis Rich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSopAAAAYAAJ&q=history+of+the+united+states+treasury|title=Financial History of the United States|date=1922|publisher=Longmans, Green and Company|language=en|access-date=November 22, 2020|archive-date=December 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231213050157/https://books.google.com/books?id=VSopAAAAYAAJ&q=history+of+the+united+states+treasury#v=snippet&q=history%20of%20the%20united%20states%20treasury&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, the department notes its guiding purpose as \"Treasury's mission\" instead of \"the Treasury's mission.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/role-of-the-treasury|title=Role of the Treasury {{!}} U.S. Department of the Treasury|website=home.treasury.gov|access-date=April 27, 2020|quote=Treasury's mission highlights its role as the steward of U.S. economic and financial systems, and as an influential participant in the world economy.|archive-date=April 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200429220544/https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/role-of-the-treasury|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was designated Superintendent of Finance in 1781 and restored stability to the nation's finances. Morris, a wealthy colonial [[merchant]], was nicknamed \"the financier\" because of his reputation for procuring funds or goods on a moment's notice. His staff included a [[comptroller]], a [[treasurer]], a [[Register of the Treasury|register]], and [[auditor]]s, who managed the country's finances through 1784, when Morris resigned because of ill health. The treasury board, consisting of three commissioners, continued to oversee the finances of the confederation of former colonies until September 1789.\n\n===Creation of the Treasury===\n[[Image:Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury (1789-1968).png|thumb|Original seal, dating from before 1968]]\nThe [[1st United States Congress|First United States Congress]] convened in [[New York City]] on March 4, 1789, marking the beginning of government under the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]]. On September 2, 1789, Congress created a permanent institution for the management of government finances:<blockquote>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That there shall be a Department of Treasury, in which shall be the following officers, namely: a Secretary of the Treasury, to be deemed head of the department; a Comptroller, an Auditor, a Treasurer, a Register, and an [[United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury|Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury]], which assistant shall be appointed by the said Secretary.<ref name=\"Act-to-establish\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legisworks.org/sal/1/stats/STATUTE-1-Pg65.pdf|title=Chapter 12, 1 Statue. 65|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019033202/http://legisworks.org/sal/1/stats/STATUTE-1-Pg65.pdf|archive-date=October 19, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>[[Alexander Hamilton]] took the oath of office as the first [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|secretary of the treasury]] on September 11, 1789. Hamilton had served as [[George Washington]]'s ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was influential in the [[United States Constitution#1788 ratification|ratification]] of the Constitution. Hamilton's [[business acumen|financial and managerial acumen]] made him a logical choice for addressing the problem of the new nation's heavy [[war debt]]. His first official act as secretary was to submit a report to Congress in which he laid the foundation for the nation's financial health.\n\nTo the surprise of many legislators, he insisted upon [[Debt Assumption|federal assumption]] and dollar-for-dollar repayment of the country's $75&nbsp;million debt in order to revitalize the [[public credit]]: \"[T]he debt of the United States was the price of liberty.

In 1862, she prevented a major theft from the department of more than $200,000 when she came across a box filled with U.S. currency, including a number of thousand-dollar bills, and reported it to Secretary Spinner. U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] subsequently honored her with a commendation for her actions, and the federal government rewarded her with an appointment for life as a messenger with its Department of Issues.<ref>Logan, Mrs. John A.
