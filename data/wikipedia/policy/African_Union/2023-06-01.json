The most important decisions of the AU are made by the [[Assembly of the African Union]], a semi-annual meeting of the heads of state and government of its member states.\n\nThe AU's secretariat, the [[African Union Commission]], is based in Addis Ababa. The largest city in the AU is [[Lagos, Nigeria]], while the [[list of urban areas in Africa by population|largest urban agglomeration]] is [[Cairo, Egypt]].

The highest decision-making organ is the [[Assembly of the African Union]], made up of all the heads of state or government of member states of the AU. The Assembly is chaired by [[F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi]], President of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The AU also has a representative body, the [[Pan-African Parliament]], which consists of 265 members elected by the national legislatures of the AU member states. Its president is [[Roger Nkodo Dang]].\n\nOther political institutions of the AU include:\n\n* the [[Executive Council of the African Union|Executive Council]], made up of [[foreign minister]]s, which prepares decisions for the Assembly;\n* the [[Permanent Representatives' Committee of the African Union|Permanent Representatives Committee]], made up of the ambassadors to [[Addis Ababa]] of AU member states; and\n* the [[Economic, Social, and Cultural Council]] (ECOSOCC), a civil society consultative body.\n\nThe [[African Union Commission|AU Commission]], the secretariat to the political structures, is chaired by [[Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma]] of South Africa. On 15 July 2012, Dlamini-Zuma won a tightly contested vote to become the first female head of the African Union Commission, replacing [[Jean Ping]] of [[Gabon]].\n\nOther AU structures are hosted by different member states:\n\n* the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] is based in [[Banjul]], [[the Gambia]]; and\n* the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) and [[APRM]] [[wikt:secretariat|Secretariats]] and the [[Pan-African Parliament]] are in [[Midrand]], South Africa.\n\nThe AU's first military intervention in a member state was the May 2003 deployment of a peacekeeping force of soldiers from South Africa, [[Ethiopia]], and [[Mozambique]] to [[Burundi]] to oversee the implementation of the various agreements. AU troops were also deployed in the [[Sudan]] for peacekeeping during the [[War in Darfur|Darfur Conflict]], before the mission was handed over to the [[United Nations]] on 1 January 2008 via [[United Nations\u2013African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]].

These include the [[African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption]] (2003), the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (2007), the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) and its associated Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance.<ref>[http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Documents/Treaties/treaties.htm Africa-union.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604051527/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Documents/Treaties/treaties.htm |date=4 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the African Union|History of Africa}}\n\nThe historical foundations of the African Union originated in the '''First Congress of Independence African States''', held in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]], from 15 to 22 April 1958.

The seat of the PAP is at [[Midrand]], [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. The Parliament is composed of 265&nbsp;elected representatives from all 55&nbsp;AU states, and intended to provide popular and civil-society participation in the processes of democratic governance. Its president is [[Roger Nkodo Dang]], of [[Cameroon]].\n; [[Assembly of the African Union]]: Composed of heads of state and heads of government of AU states, the Assembly is currently the supreme governing body of the African Union. It is gradually devolving some of its decision-making powers to the Pan-African Parliament. It meets once a year and makes its decisions by consensus or by a two-thirds majority. The current [[Chairperson of the African Union|chair of the AU]] is President [[Macky Sall]], President of [[Senegal]].\n; [[African Union Commission|African Union Commission (or Authority)]] : The secretariat of the African Union, composed of ten commissioners and supporting staff and headquartered in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia. In a similar fashion to its [[European Union|European]] counterpart, the [[European Commission]], it is responsible for the administration and coordination of the AU's activities and meetings.\n; [[Court of Justice of the African Union]]: The Constitutive Act provides for a Court of Justice to rule on disputes over interpretation of AU treaties. A protocol to set up this Court of Justice was adopted in 2003 and entered into force in 2009. It was, however, superseded by a protocol creating an [[African Court of Justice and Human Rights]], which will incorporate the already established [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (see below) and have two chambers: one for general legal matters and one for rulings on the human rights treaties.\n; [[Executive Council of the African Union|Executive Council]]: Composed of ministers designated by the governments of member states. It decides on matters such as foreign trade, social security, food, agriculture and communications, is accountable to the Assembly, and prepares material for the Assembly to discuss and approve. It is chaired by Shawn Makuyana of Zimbabwe (2015\u2013 ).\n; [[Permanent Representatives' Committee of the African Union|Permanent Representatives' Committee]]: Consisting of nominated permanent representatives of member states, the Committee prepares the work for the Executive Council, similar to the role of the [[Committee of Permanent Representatives]] in the [[European Union]].\n; [[Peace and Security Council]] (PSC): Proposed at the Lusaka Summit in 2001 and established in 2004 under a protocol to the Constitutive Act adopted by the AU Assembly in July 2002. The protocol defines the PSC as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and effective response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa. Other responsibilities conferred to the PSC by the protocol include prevention, management and resolution of conflicts, post-conflict peace building and developing common defence policies. The PSC has fifteen members elected on a regional basis by the Assembly. Similar in intent and operation to the [[United Nations Security Council]].\n; [[Economic, Social and Cultural Council]]:An advisory organ composed of professional and civic representatives, similar to the European [[Economic and Social Committee]]. The chair of ECOSOCC, elected in 2008, is Cameroonian lawyer [[Akere Muna]] of the Pan-African Lawyers Union (PALU).\n; [[Specialised Technical Committees of the African Union|Specialised Technical Committees]]: Both the Abuja Treaty and the Constitutive Act provide for Specialised Technical Committees to be established made up of African ministers to advise the Assembly. In practice, they have never been set up. The ten proposed themes are: Rural Economy and Agricultural Matters; Monetary and Financial Affairs; Trade, Customs, and Immigration; Industry, Science and Technology; Energy, Natural Resources, and Environment; Transport, Communications, and Tourism; Health; Labour, and Social Affairs; Education, Culture, and Human Resources.\n; Financial institutions\n* [[African Central Bank]] \u2013 [[Abuja]], Nigeria\n* [[African Investment Bank]] \u2013 [[Tripoli, Libya]]\n* [[African Monetary Fund]] \u2013 [[Yaound\u00e9]], Cameroon\nThese institutions have not yet been established; however, the Steering Committees working on their founding have been constituted. Eventually, the AU aims to have a single currency (the [[Afro (currency)|Afro]]).\n; Health: The [[Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention]] (Africa CDC), founded in 2016 and launched in 2017.

The [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] was established in 2006 to supplement the work of the commission, following the entry into force of a protocol to the African Charter providing for its creation.

No final decision was taken on the recommendations, however, and a committee of ten heads of state was appointed to consider the review and report back to the July 2008 summit to be held in Egypt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Conferences/2008/january/summit/docs/decisions/Assembly.Dec_171%20-%20192%20_X_%20-%20Addis_February_2008.pdf |title=Decision on the Report of the Executive Council on the Audit of the Union and the Report of the Ministerial Committee on the Union Government, Doc.

The 1980 [[Lagos Plan of Action for the Development of Africa]] and the 1991 treaty to establish the African Economic Community (also referred to as the Abuja Treaty), proposed the creation of [[Regional Economic Communities]] (RECs) as the basis for African integration, with a timetable for regional and then continental integration to follow.<ref>See note on [https://web.archive.org/web/20040906140832/http://www.dfa.gov.za/docs/2003/au0815.htm The Role of the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) as the Building Blocks of the African Union] prepared by the South African Department of Foreign Affairs.</ref>\n\nCurrently, there are eight RECs recognised by the AU, each established under a separate regional treaty. They are:\n* the [[Arab Maghreb Union]] (AMU)\n* the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA)\n* the [[Community of Sahel-Saharan States]] (CEN-SAD)\n* the [[East African Community]] (EAC)\n* the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] (ECCAS)\n* the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS)\n* the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD)\n* the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC)\n\nThe membership of many of the communities overlaps, and their rationalisation has been under discussion for several years\u2014and formed the theme of the 2006 Banjul summit. At the July 2007 Accra summit the Assembly finally decided to adopt a Protocol on Relations between the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities.<ref>Decision on the Protocol on Relations between the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities (RECs), Assembly/AU/Dec.166 (IX).</ref> This protocol is intended to facilitate the harmonisation of policies and ensure compliance with the Abuja Treaty and Lagos Plan of Action time frames.\n\n=== Selection of the chairperson ===\nIn 2006, the AU decided to create a Committee \"to consider the implementation of a rotation system between the regions\" in relation to the presidency. Controversy arose at the 2006 summit when Sudan announced its candidacy for the AU's chairmanship, as a representative of the East African region. Several member states refused to support Sudan because of tensions over [[Darfur]] (see also below). Sudan ultimately withdrew its candidacy and President [[Denis Sassou-Nguesso]] of the [[Republic of the Congo]] was elected to a one-year term. At the January 2007 summit, Sassou-Nguesso was replaced by President [[John Agyekum Kufuor]] of Ghana, despite another attempt by Sudan to gain the chair. The year 2007 was the 50th anniversary of Ghana's independence, a symbolic moment for the country to hold the chair of the AU\u2014and to host the mid-year summit at which the proposed Union Government was also discussed. In January 2008, President [[Jakaya Kikwete]] of Tanzania took over as chair, representing the East African region and thus apparently ending Sudan's attempt to become chair\u2014at least till the rotation returned to East Africa.<ref>See [http://www.afrimap.org/english/images/report/AU_People-DrivenNov07.pdf ''Towards a People-Driven African Union: Current Obstacles and New Opportunities''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216054523/http://www.afrimap.org/english/images/report/AU_People-DrivenNov07.pdf |date=16 February 2008 }}, AfriMAP, AFRODAD and Oxfam GB, Updated Edition November 2007, pp. 45\u201346, and [http://www.afrimap.org/english/images/report/AfriMAP-AU-Guide-EN.pdf ''Strengthening Popular Participation in the African Union: A Guide to AU Structures and Processes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927110741/http://www.afrimap.org/english/images/report/AfriMAP-AU-Guide-EN.pdf |date=27 September 2013 }}, AfriMAP and Oxfam GB, 2010, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> The current chair is [[Azali Assoumani]], President of [[Comoros]], whose term began on February 18, 2023.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20230218/president-azali-assoumani-union-comoros-takes-over-new-chairperson/|title=PRESS RELEASES President Azali Assoumani of the Union of Comoros, Takes Over as the New Chairperson of the African Union (AU) for 2023|publisher=African Union|date=February 18, 2022|accessdate=February 20, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==== List of chairpersons ====\n{{main|Chairperson of the African Union}}\n[[File:Jakaya Kikwete and Muammar al-Gaddafi, 12th AU Summit, 090202-N-0506A-678.jpg|thumb|left|[[Muammar Gaddafi]] embracing Tanzanian President [[Jakaya Kikwete|Kikwete]] after assuming the chairmanship]]\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-valign=top\n|+Chairpersons of the African Union\n|-\n!Name\n!Beginning of term\n!End of term\n!Country\n|-\n|[[Thabo Mbeki]]\n|9 July 2002\n|10 July 2003\n|{{flag|South Africa}}\n|-\n|[[Joaquim Chissano]]\n|10 July 2003\n|6 July 2004\n|{{flag|Mozambique}}\n|-\n|[[Olusegun Obasanjo]]\n|6 July 2004\n|24 January 2006\n|{{flag|Nigeria}}\n|-\n|[[Denis Sassou-Nguesso]]\n|24 January 2006\n|24 January 2007\n|{{flag|Republic of the Congo}}\n|-\n|[[John Kufuor]]\n|30 January 2007\n|31 January 2008\n|{{flag|Ghana}}\n|-\n|[[Jakaya Kikwete]]\n|31 January 2008\n|2 February 2009\n|{{flag|Tanzania}}\n|-\n|[[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]\n|2 February 2009\n|31 January 2010\n|{{flagdeco|Libya|1977}} [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]\n|-\n|[[Bingu wa Mutharika]]<ref>[https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE60U05O20100131l Gaddafi fails in bid to remain African Union chair], Reuters, 31 January 2010 {{Dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111230205627/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g8cvj3048f4WEB6UQuim80MKqhVA Malawi president takes over as AU president], AFP, 31 January 2010</ref>\n|31 January 2010\n|31 January 2011\n|{{flag|Malawi|2010}}\n|-\n|[[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]]<ref>[http://www.au.int/en/dp/cp/biography According to the AU] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006153642/http://www.au.int/en/dp/cp/biography |date=6 October 2011 }}, his official style is ''Son Excellence Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique, Chef de l'\u00c9tat et Pr\u00e9sident Fondateur du Parti D\u00e9mocratique de Guin\u00e9e Equatoriale'' {{in lang|fr}}.

red rings, from which palm leaves shoot up around an outer gold circle and an inner green circle, within which is a gold representation of Africa. The red interlinked rings stand for African solidarity and the blood shed for the liberation of Africa; the palm leaves, for peace; the gold, for Africa's wealth and bright future; the green, for African hopes and aspirations. To symbolise African unity, the silhouette of Africa is drawn without internal borders.<ref>[https://au.int/en/about/symbols African Union Symbols], AU website.</ref>\n\nThe African Union adopted its new flag at its 14th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government taking place in Addis Ababa 2010. During the 8th African Union Summit which took place in Addis Ababa on 29 and 30 January 2007, the Heads of State and Government decided to launch a competition for the selection of a new flag for the Union. They prescribed a green background for the flag symbolising hope of Africa and stars to represent Member States.\n\nPursuant to this decision, the African Union Commission (AUC) organised a competition for the selection of a new flag for the African Union. The AUC received a total of 106 entries proposed by citizens of 19 African countries and 2 from the Diaspora. The proposals were then examined by a panel of experts put in place by the African Union Commission and selected from the five African regions for short listing according to the main directions given by the Heads of State and Government.<ref name=\"bojia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2010/02/18/hfs-staffer-yadesa-bojia-celebrated-for-designing-striking-new-african-union-flag/ |title=HFS staffer Yadesa Bojia celebrated for designing striking new African Union flag |first=Peter |last=Kelley |date=February 18, 2010 |publisher=[[University of Washington]]}}</ref>\n\nAt the 13th Ordinary Session of the Assembly, the Heads of State and Government examined the report of the Panel and selected one among all the proposals. The flag is now part of the paraphernalia of the African Union and replaces the old one.\n\nThe old [[flag of the African Union]] bears a broad green horizontal stripe, a narrow band of gold, the emblem of the African Union at the centre of a broad white stripe, another narrow gold band and a final broad green stripe. Again, the green and gold symbolise Africa's hopes and aspirations as well as its wealth and bright future, and the white represents the purity of Africa's desire for friends throughout the world. The flag has led to the creation of the \"[[national colours]]\" of Africa of gold and green (sometimes together with white). These colours are visible in one way or another in the flags of many African nations.

The PSC has the power, among other things, to authorise peace support missions, to impose sanctions in case of unconstitutional change of government, and to \"take initiatives and action it deems appropriate\" in response to potential or actual conflicts. The PSC is a decision-making body in its own right, and its decisions are binding on member states.\n\nArticle 4(h) of the Constitutive Act, repeated in article 4 of the Protocol to the Constitutive Act on the PSC, also recognises the right of the Union to intervene in a member state in circumstances of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. Any decision to intervene in a member state under article 4 of the Constitutive Act will be made by the Assembly on the recommendation of the PSC.\n\nSince it first met in 2004, the PSC has been active in relation to the crises in Darfur, Comoros, Somalia, [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], Burundi, Ivory Coast and other countries. It has adopted resolutions creating the AU peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Darfur, and imposing sanctions against persons undermining peace and security (such as travel bans and asset freezes against the leaders of the rebellion in Comoros).
