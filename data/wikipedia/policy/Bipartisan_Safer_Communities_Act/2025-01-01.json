They directed her to Senators [[John Cornyn]] and [[Thom Tillis]]. Thirty minutes later, Senator [[Chris Murphy]] texted Sinema to join the negotiation, as Murphy had been one of the Senate's most prominent gun control advocates since the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in his state in 2012.

The bill also requires CMS to provide resources and guidance to state governments and schools in order to provide mental health services in school settings. It creates a technical assistance center to facilitate this goal and authorizes CMS to distribute $50 million in grants to state governments. The bill requires CMS to review and assist state implementation of the [[EPSDT]] program.

It prohibits the purchase of a firearm if the purchaser has committed a disqualifying crime while under 18 and requires a [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]] (NICS) background check to include the records of state governments and local law enforcement. It also ensures that during this process mental health records under the age of 16 are not disqualifying, that no waiting periods are applied, and that an annual audit take place to ensure that only applicable criminal records are considered. These provisions expire on September 30, 2032, except for the restrictions on juvenile criminal records and the protections of mental health records under the age of 16.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSection 12002 clarifies definitions of gun sellers and requires routine gun sellers to obtain a federal firearms license (FFL).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSection 12003 permits states to use grant funds from the [[Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program|Byrne JAG]] program to implement crisis intervention programs. These may include \"[[red flag law]]s\", but the bill contains protections for due process, including a right to fair hearings and legal counsel and a burden of proof. States are permitted to choose what type of crisis intervention program to implement using this funding, if any, and are required to provide an annual report on any programs funded through this program.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSection 12004 makes it a federal crime to [[weapons trafficking|traffic illegal firearms]] into the United States. It also makes it a crime to make a straw purchase by purchasing a firearm on behalf of someone who is not permitted to purchase a firearm. Violators of these statutes are subject to up to 15 years in prison, and the penalty increases to 25 years if the firearm is used in a terrorist attack or [[drug trafficking]]. It provides law enforcement the authority to utilize several mechanisms to investigate these crimes, including [[wire-tapping]], forfeiture, [[racketeering]] charges, fines, and [[money laundering]] authorities. It also expands criminal statutes to criminalize smuggling firearms outside of the United States, grants all FFL holders access to the NICS background check system, funds an [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms|ATF]] education program on [[straw purchase]]s, funds coordination programs between federal and local law enforcement, and forbids [[Operation Fast and Furious]] type programs.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSection 12005 narrows the \"[[boyfriend loophole]]\" by changing regulations on firearm purchases by those convicted of [[domestic violence]]. Previously, the law only regulated firearms purchases following domestic assault of a spouse or [[Cohabitation|cohabitant]]. The bill expands this restriction to disqualify anyone found guilty of a domestic violence charge in a romantic relationship, regardless of marital status. The restrictions apply for five years, after which the ability to own a firearm is restored if no additional violent crimes take place. The provision only applies to domestic violence charges after the law takes effect with no retroactive penalties.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Title III: Other Matters===\nTitle III of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act provides for administrative measures to implement the bill. It places a one-year moratorium on the Medicare Rebate Rule to offset the funds spent under this bill and requires that all remaining funds be deposited into the Medicare Improvement Fund. It also prohibits the use of [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] funds for the provision of dangerous weapons. The Luke and Alex School Safety Act of 2022 codifies the purpose of the schoolsafety.gov website into law.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Appropriations===\nThe bill makes the following appropriations, funded by the Medicare Rebate Rule offset:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]\n** $750 million over five years for [[Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program|Byrne Justice Assistance Grant  (JAG) Program]] crisis prevention programs\n*** This sum is allocated to states to support the creation and maintenance of crisis intervention programs for state courts, including [[red flag law]] programs and [[mental health court]], [[drug court]], or [[veterans' court]] programs.<ref name=LaiCochrane/><ref>Chip Brownlee & Tom Kutsch, [https://www.thetrace.org/2022/06/senate-gun-bill-safer-communities-act/ What You Need to Know About the Senate Gun Reform Bill], ''The Trace'' (June 24, 2022).</ref>\n** $300 million over five years to fund provisions of the [[STOP School Violence Act]].\n** $250 million over five years for community violence intervention programs.\n** $200 million over five years for NICS background checks.\n** $100 million to fund FBI expenses.\n* [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]\n** $250 million over four years to provide states with flexible funding to create community mental health services through the [[SAMHSA]] Community Mental Health Block Grant program.\n** $240 million over four years to assist students with mental health disorders and educate school personnel on mental health disorders through SAMHSA's Project AWARE.\n** $150 million to implement the 988 [[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline]].\n** $120 million over four years for SAMHSA to train first responders on how to engage with individuals with mental disorders.\n** $80 million over four years to facilitate cooperation between pediatric primary care providers and mental health specialists.\n** $60 million over five years to train pediatric primary care physicians in mental healthcare through the [[HRSA]] Primary Care Training and Enhancement Program.\n** $40 million over four years to assist children that have experienced traumatic events through SAMHSA's National Child Traumatic Stress Network.\n* [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]\n** $1 billion to provide states with funds to create a variety of school safety programs, crisis intervention programs, and school personnel training on suicide prevention and human trafficking.\n** $500 million to expand the School-Based Mental Health Services Grants.\n** $500 million to expand the School-Based Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration Grant.\n** $50 million to expand [[21st Century Community Learning Centers]].\n\n===Other===\nSection 1 at the beginning of the bill contains the original provision that names the United States Courthouse and Federal Building in Tallahassee, Florida after former judge [[Joseph W.
