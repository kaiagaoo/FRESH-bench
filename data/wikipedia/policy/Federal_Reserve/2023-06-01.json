This practice is called [[fractional-reserve banking]]. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a [[bank run]]. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a [[lender of last resort]] when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel]] laureate [[Milton Friedman]], believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929; Friedman argued that this contributed to the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"Federal Reserve Board\">{{Cite web |last=Bernanke, Ben |date=October 24, 2003 |title=Remarks by Governor Ben S.

It is briefly described in ''The Federal Reserve System{{Nsmdns}}Purposes and Functions'' as follows:<ref>{{Harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83}}</ref>\n\n{{Blockquote|By creating the Federal Reserve System, Congress intended to eliminate the severe financial crises that had periodically swept the nation, especially the sort of financial panic that occurred in 1907. During that episode, payments were disrupted throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks, a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks. To address these problems, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system. The System, then, was to provide not only an elastic currency{{Nsmdns}}that is, a currency that would expand or shrink in amount as economic conditions warranted{{Nsmdns}}but also an efficient and equitable check-collection system.}}\n\n==== Lender of last resort ====\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve serves as the [[lender of last resort]] to those institutions that cannot obtain credit elsewhere and the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy. It took over this role from the private sector \"clearing houses\" which operated during the [[History of central banking in the United States#1837\u20131862: \"Free Banking\" Era|Free Banking Era]]; whether public or private, the availability of liquidity was intended to prevent bank runs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/glossary.cfm?js=0#l |title=Lender of last resort |publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]] |access-date=May 21, 2010}}; {{Cite ssrn |title=Lender of Last Resort: The Concept in History |last=Humphrey |first=Thomas M. |date=1 January 1989 |ssrn=2125371}}</ref>\n\n==== Fluctuations ====\nThrough its [[discount window]] and credit operations, Reserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals. Longer-term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate).\n\nBy making these loans, the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates.<ref name=\"dfeverydayecon\"/> For example, on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized an $85&nbsp;billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant [[American International Group]] (AIG).<ref name=\"Federal Reserve-AIG Press Release-2008-09-16\">{{Cite web |date=September 16, 2008 |title=Press Release: Federal Reserve Board, with full support of the Treasury Department, authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to $85 billion to the American International Group (AIG) |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20080916a.htm |access-date=August 29, 2011 |publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve}}; {{Cite news |last1=Andrews |first1=Edmund L. |last2=de la Merced |first2=Michael J. |last3=Walsh |first3=Mary Williams |date=September 16, 2008 |title=Fed's $85 Billion Loan Rescues Insurer |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/business/17insure.html |access-date=September 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Central bank ===\n{{Further|Central bank}}\n[[File:Onedolar2009series.jpg|right|thumb|Obverse of a Federal Reserve [[United States one-dollar bill|$1 note]] issued in 2009]]\n\nIn its role as the [[central bank]] of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems [[Treasury security|U.S. government securities]] such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's [[Coins of the United States dollar|coin]] and [[Federal Reserve note|paper currency]]. The U.S. Treasury, through its [[United States Mint|Bureau of the Mint]] and [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways.<ref name=\"Fed_currency\">{{Cite web |date=June 2008 |title=How Currency Gets into Circulation |url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed01.html |access-date=August 29, 2011 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York}}</ref> During the [[Fiscal Year]] 2020, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 57.95&nbsp;billion notes at an average cost of 7.4 cents per note.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Annual Production Reports {{!}} Engraving & Printing |url=https://www.bep.gov/currency/production-figures/annual-production-reports |access-date=2023-01-06 |website=www.bep.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System |date=2021 |title=2021 Currency Budget |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/foia/files/2021currency.pdf |publisher=federalreserve.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Federal funds ====\n{{Main|Federal funds}}\n\nFederal funds are the reserve balances (also called [[Federal Reserve Deposits]]) that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 2007 |title=Federal Funds |url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed15.html |access-date=August 29, 2011 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York}}; {{Cite web |year=1993 |editor-last=Cook |editor-first=Timothy Q. |editor2-last=Laroche |editor2-first=Robert K. |title=Instruments of the Money Market |url=http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/special_reports/instruments_of_the_money_market/pdf/full_publication.pdf |access-date=August 29, 2011 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond}}</ref> These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System. The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is what inspired the name of the system and it is what is used as the basis for monetary policy. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds.\n\nFederal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit, which can be converted into [[federal reserve note]]s. Private banks maintain their [[bank reserves]] in federal reserve accounts.\n\n=== Bank regulation ===\nThe Federal Reserve regulates private banks. The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation. In 2006 [[Donald L. Kohn]], vice chairman of the board of governors, summarized the history of this compromise:<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 3, 2006 |title=Speech \u2013 Kohn, The Evolving Role of the Federal Reserve Banks |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kohn20061103a.htm |access-date=August 29, 2011 |publisher=Federalreserve.gov}}</ref>\n\n{{Blockquote|Agrarian and progressive interests, led by William Jennings Bryan, favored a central bank under public, rather than banker, control. But the vast majority of the nation's bankers, concerned about government intervention in the banking business, opposed a central bank structure directed by political appointees.\n\nThe legislation that Congress ultimately adopted in 1913 reflected a hard-fought battle to balance these two competing views and created the hybrid public-private, centralized-decentralized structure that we have today.}}\n\nThe balance between private interests and government can also be seen in the structure of the system. Private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the board of governors are selected by the [[president of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].\n\n==== Government regulation and supervision ====\n[[File:House Financial Services Committee hearing with Ben Bernanke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ben Bernanke]] (lower right), former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, at a [[House Financial Services Committee]] hearing on February 10, 2009.

It has supervisory responsibilities for state-chartered banks<ref>See example: {{Cite web |date=March 31, 2009 |title=Advantages of Being/Becoming a State Chartered Bank |url=http://www.state.ar.us/bank/benefits_advantages.html |access-date=August 29, 2011 |publisher=Arkansas State Bank Department |df=mdy-all}}</ref> that are members of the Federal Reserve System, [[Bank holding company|bank holding companies]] (companies that control banks), the foreign activities of member banks, the U.S. activities of foreign banks, and [[Edge Act]] and \"agreement corporations\" (limited-purpose institutions that engage in a foreign banking business). The Board and, under delegated authority, the Federal Reserve Banks, supervise approximately 900 state member banks and 5,000 bank holding companies. Other federal agencies also serve as the primary federal supervisors of commercial banks; the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] supervises national banks, and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] supervises [[state bank]]s that are not members of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSome regulations issued by the Board apply to the entire banking industry, whereas others apply only to member banks, that is, [[state bank]]s that have chosen to join the Federal Reserve System and national banks, which by law must be members of the System. The Board also issues regulations to carry out major federal laws governing [[Consumer protection|consumer credit protection]], such as the [[Truth in Lending Act|Truth in Lending]], [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act|Equal Credit Opportunity]], and [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]]s. Many of these consumer protection regulations apply to various lenders outside the banking industry as well as to banks.\n\nMembers of the Board of Governors are in continual contact with other policy makers in government. They frequently testify before [[congressional committee]]s on the economy, [[monetary policy]], [[Bank regulation|banking supervision and regulation]], [[Consumer protection|consumer credit protection]], [[financial market]]s, and other matters.\n\nThe Board has regular contact with members of the President's [[Council of Economic Advisers]] and other key economic officials. The Chair also meets from time to time with the [[President of the United States]] and has regular meetings with the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]. The Chair has formal responsibilities in the international arena as well.}}\n\n===== Regulatory and oversight responsibilities =====\nThe board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. If the board of directors of a district bank has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly, it will report this to the board of governors. This policy is described in law:\n\n{{Blockquote|Each Federal reserve bank shall keep itself informed of the general character and amount of the loans and investments of its member banks with a view to ascertaining whether undue use is being made of bank credit for the speculative carrying of or trading in securities, real estate, or commodities, or for any other purpose inconsistent with the maintenance of sound credit conditions; and, in determining whether to grant or refuse advances, rediscounts, or other credit accommodations, the Federal reserve bank shall give consideration to such information. The chairman of the Federal reserve bank shall report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any such undue use of bank credit by any member bank, together with his recommendation. Whenever, in the judgment of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, any member bank is making such undue use of bank credit, the Board may, in its discretion, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend such bank from the use of the credit facilities of the Federal Reserve System and may terminate such suspension or may renew it from time to time.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 22, 2010 |title=U.S. Code Title 12, Chapter 3, Subchapter 7, Section 301.

The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities.<ref>{{Harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83\u201385}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act]] of 1980, Congress reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system. The act subjects all depository institutions, not just member commercial banks, to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services.\nThe Federal Reserve plays a role in the nation's retail and wholesale payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retail clients{{Nsmdns}}individuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks' retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, electronically transferring funds through [[FedACH]] (the Federal Reserve's [[automated clearing house]] system), and beginning in 2023, facilitating [[instant payment]]s using the [[FedNow]] service. By contrast, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's large corporate customers or counterparties, including other financial institutions. The Reserve Banks' wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the [[Fedwire|Fedwire Funds Service]] and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the Fedwire Securities Service.\n\n== Structure ==\n{{Main|Structure of the Federal Reserve System}}\n[[File:FederalReserve System.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Organization of the Federal Reserve System]]\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has a \"unique structure that is both public and private\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Role of the Federal Reserve System |url=http://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2005/Pianalto_20051005.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315065708/http://clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2005/Pianalto_20051005.cfm |archive-date=March 15, 2013 |access-date=June 24, 2013 |website=Innovation and Education: Renewing the Northeast Ohio Economy |publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland]] |df=mdy-all}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/about%20us/who%20we%20are.aspx |title=Who We Are |access-date=2015-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208042053/https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/about%20us/who%20we%20are.aspx |archive-date=December 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and is described as \"[[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent within the government]]\" rather than \"[[Privatization|independent of government]]\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> The System does not require public funding, and derives its authority and purpose from the [[Federal Reserve Act]], which was passed by Congress in 1913 and is subject to Congressional modification or repeal.<ref name=\"FRBPhilPubPriv\">[http://www.philadelphiafed.org/education/teachers/resources/fed-today/fed-today_lesson-3.pdf \"Is The Fed Public Or Private?\"] [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]].

The FOMC oversees and sets policy on [[open market operations]], the principal tool of national monetary policy. These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; the presidents of the other banks rotate membership at two- and three-year intervals. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the chair of the board of governors as its chair and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion. The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed.<ref>{{Harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\nThere is very strong consensus among economists against politicising the FOMC.<ref name=\"igmchicago.org\">{{Cite web |title=Fed Appointments - IGM Forum |url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/fed-appointments}}</ref>\n\n=== Federal Advisory Council ===\n{{Main|Federal Advisory Council}}\n\nThe Federal Advisory Council, composed of twelve representatives of the banking industry, advises the board on all matters within its jurisdiction.\n\n=== Federal Reserve Banks ===\n{{Main|Federal Reserve Bank}}\n[[File:Federal Reserve Districts Map - Banks & Branches.png|upright=1.8|right|thumb|Map of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, with the 12 Federal Reserve Banks marked as black squares, and all Branches within each district (24 total) marked as red circles.

What happens to money and credit affects interest rates (the cost of credit) and the performance of an economy. The [[Federal Reserve Act of 1913]] gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States.<ref name=\"mp\">{{Cite web |date=August 22, 2011 |title=Federal Open Market Committee |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm |access-date=August 29, 2011 |publisher=Federalreserve.gov}}</ref><ref name=\"mpb\">{{Cite web |title=We Apologize |url=https://www.federalreserveeducation.org/pagenotfound?aspxerrorpath=/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105153340/http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm |archive-date=January 5, 2010 |website=www.federalreserveeducation.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Interbank lending ===\nThe Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the [[federal funds rate]], which is the rate of interbank lending of [[excess reserves]]. The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the [[interbank lending market|interbank market]] and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the three \"tools\" of monetary policy described in the [[Federal Reserve System#Monetary policy|''Tools'' section]] below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve summarized its monetary policy in 2005:\n\n{{Blockquote|The Federal Reserve implements U.S. monetary policy by affecting conditions in the market for balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve Banks...By conducting [[open market operations]], imposing reserve requirements, permitting depository institutions to hold contractual clearing balances, and extending credit through its discount window facility, the Federal Reserve exercises considerable control over the demand for and supply of Federal Reserve balances and the federal funds rate. Through its control of the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve is able to foster financial and monetary conditions consistent with its monetary policy objectives.<ref name=\"BoG 2005 pp=27\"/>}}\n\nEffects on the quantity of reserves that banks used to make loans influence the economy. Policy actions that add reserves to the banking system encourage lending at lower interest rates thus stimulating growth in money, credit, and the economy. Policy actions that absorb reserves work in the opposite direction. The Fed's task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit, avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth.<ref>{{Cite web |year=2012 |title=Federal Reserve System in Action |url=http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019011327/http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action |archive-date=October 19, 2012 |access-date=November 24, 2012 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Tools ===\nThere are three main tools of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve uses to influence the amount of reserves in private banks:<ref name=\"mp\"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Federal Reserve Board - Policy Tools |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policytools.htm |access-date=2022-02-15 |website=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n!Tool\n!Description\n\n|-\n| [[Open market operations]]\n| Purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities{{Nsmdns}}the Federal Reserve's principal tool for implementing monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's objective for open market operations has varied over the years. During the 1980s, the focus gradually shifted toward attaining a specified level of the [[federal funds rate]] (the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed), a process that was largely complete by the end of the decade.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 26, 2010 |title=Monetary Policy, Open Market Operations |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413160651/http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm |archive-date=April 13, 2001 |access-date=August 29, 2011 |publisher=Federalreserve.gov}}</ref>\n\n|-\n| Discount rate\n| The interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional Federal Reserve Bank's lending facility{{Nsmdns}}the [[discount window]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 19, 2011 |title=FRB: Monetary Policy, the Discount Rate |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/discountrate.htm |access-date=August 29, 2011 |publisher=Federalreserve.gov}}</ref>\n\n|-\n| [[Reserve requirements]]\n| The amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities.<ref name=\"reserve_req\">{{Cite web |date=October 26, 2010 |title=Monetary Policy, Reserve Requirements |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm |access-date=August 29, 2011 |publisher=Federalreserve.gov}}</ref>\n\n|}\n\n==== Federal funds rate and open market operations ====\n{{Further|Open market operations|money creation|federal funds rate}}\n[[File:Federal funds rate history and recessions.png|frameless|upright=2.75|right]]\n\nThe Federal Reserve System implements [[monetary policy]] largely by targeting the [[federal funds rate]]. This is the [[interest rate]] that banks charge each other for overnight loans of [[federal funds]], which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations. The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.\n\nOpen market operations allow the Federal Reserve to increase or decrease the amount of money in the banking system as necessary to balance the Federal Reserve's dual mandates. Open market operations are done through the sale and purchase of [[United States Treasury security]], sometimes called \"Treasury bills\" or more informally \"T-bills\" or \"Treasuries\". The Federal Reserve buys Treasury bills from its primary dealers. The purchase of these securities affects the federal funds rate, because primary dealers have accounts at depository institutions.<ref name=\"FRB of NY\">{{Cite web |date=August 2007 |title=Open Market Operations |url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html |access-date=October 29, 2011 |publisher=New York Federal Reserve Bank}}</ref>\n\nThe Federal Reserve education website describes open market operations as follows:<ref name=\"mpb\"/>\n\n{{Blockquote|Open market operations involve the buying and selling of U.S. government securities (federal agency and mortgage-backed). The term 'open market' means that the Fed doesn't decide on its own which securities dealers it will do business with on a particular day. Rather, the choice emerges from an 'open market' in which the various securities dealers that the Fed does business with{{Nsmdns}}the primary dealers{{Nsmdns}}compete on the basis of price. Open market operations are flexible and thus, the most frequently used tool of monetary policy.\n\nOpen market operations are the primary tool used to regulate the supply of bank reserves. This tool consists of Federal Reserve purchases and sales of financial instruments, usually securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, Federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. Open market operations are carried out by the Domestic Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under direction from the FOMC. The transactions are undertaken with primary dealers.\n\nThe Fed's goal in trading the securities is to affect the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other. When the Fed wants to increase reserves, it buys securities and pays for them by making a deposit to the account maintained at the Fed by the primary dealer's bank. When the Fed wants to reduce reserves, it sells securities and collects from those accounts. Most days, the Fed does not want to increase or decrease reserves permanently so it usually engages in transactions reversed within a day or two. That means that a reserve injection today could be withdrawn tomorrow morning, only to be renewed at some level several hours later. These short-term transactions are called repurchase agreements (repos){{Nsmdns}}the dealer sells the Fed a security and agrees to buy it back at a later date.}}\n\n===== Repurchase agreements =====\n{{Further|Repurchase agreement}}\n\nTo smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply, the desk engages in [[repurchase agreement]]s (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On the day of the transaction, the Fed deposits money in a [[Primary dealers|primary dealer's]] reserve account, and receives the promised securities as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the [[primary dealer]]'s reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 2007 |title=Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Transactions |url=http://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed04.html |access-date=August 29, 2011 |website=Ny.frb.org |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York}}</ref>\n\n==== Discount rate ====\n{{Further|Discount window}}\n\nThe Federal Reserve System also directly sets the '''discount rate''' (a.k.a. the '''policy rate'''), which is the interest rate for \"discount window lending\", overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed. This rate is generally set at a rate close to 100 [[basis point]]s above the target federal funds rate.

It had several key components, including a central bank with a Washington-based headquarters and fifteen branches located throughout the U.S. in geographically strategic locations, and a uniform elastic currency based on gold and commercial paper. Aldrich believed a central banking system with no political involvement was best, but was convinced by Warburg that a plan with no public control was not politically feasible.<ref name=\"Warburg document\"/> The compromise involved representation of the public sector on the board of directors.<ref name=\"ecresearch\">{{Cite web |title=America's Unknown Enemy: Beyond Conspiracy |url=https://www.aier.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/EEB198405-REVISED1993.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220110165519/https://www.aier.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/EEB198405-REVISED1993.pdf |archive-date=10 January 2022 |publisher=American Institute of Economic Research}}</ref>\n\nAldrich's bill met much opposition from politicians.
