The 5\u20134 decision ruled that the CFPB structure, with a sole director that could only be terminated for cause, was unconstitutional as it violated the separation of powers, vacating the lower court judgement and remanding the case for review. The Court recognized that the statutes around the director of the CFPB was [[Severability|severable]] from the rest of the statute establishing the agency, and thus \"The agency may therefore continue to operate, but its Director, in light of our decision, must be removable by the President at will.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/29/supreme-court-leaves-consumer-regulator-standing-but-backs-presidents-ability-to-fire-director.html | title = Supreme Court leaves consumer regulator standing but backs president's ability to fire director | first1 = Dan | last1 = Mangan | first2 = Tucker | last2 = Higgens | date = June 29, 2020 | access-date = June 29, 2020 | work = [[CNBC]] | archive-date = June 29, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200629150200/https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/29/supreme-court-leaves-consumer-regulator-standing-but-backs-presidents-ability-to-fire-director.html | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nChief Justice [[John Roberts]] wrote the majority opinion joined by Justices [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Samuel Alito]], [[Neil Gorsuch]], and [[Brett Kavanaugh]]. Roberts wrote that the CFPB structure with a single point of leadership that could only be removed for cause \"has no foothold in history or tradition\", and has only been used in four other instances: three current uses for the [[United States Office of Special Counsel]], the [[Social Security Administration]], and the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]], and temporarily for one year during the [[American Civil War]] for the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]].<ref name=\"cnbc decision\" /> Roberts wrote that the three current uses \"are modern and contested.

Kagan wrote that \"Today's decision wipes out a feature of that agency its creators thought fundamental to its mission\u2014a measure of independence from political pressure.\"<ref name=\"cnbc decision\" /> Kagan challenged the separation of powers argument presented by the majority: \"Nowhere does the text [of the Constitution] say anything about the President's power to remove subordinate officials at will.\"<ref name=\"cnbc decision\" /> The dissenting Justices did concur on the matter of severability of the remaining structure of the CFPB outside of the director.\n\n===2022 dispute over funding structure===\n{{main|Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Community Financial Services Association of America, Limited}}\nIn 2018, the [[Community Financial Services Association of America]] sued the CFPB over its 2017 rule that blocked lenders to attempt to collect funds from borrowers' accounts after two consecutive failed attempts, unless the borrower had consented. Part of its argument in the case was that the CFPB's budgetary structure was unconstitutional, as it did not receive funding through Congressional appropriations but requested its funding through the Federal Reserve. While the district court ruled against the association, the [[Fifth Circuit]] ruled in favor of the association in October 2022, deeming that its funding structure was unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-protection-watchdogs-funding-unconstitutional-court-rules-2022-10-20/ | title = U.S. consumer protection watchdog's funding unconstitutional, court rules | first = Nate | last = Redmond |date = October 20, 2022 | accessdate = October 20, 2022 | work = [[Reuters]] }}</ref> \n\nThat opinion was appealed to the US Supreme Court, which reversed the 5th Circuit and upheld the CFPB's funding mechanism.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Jake |title=Existential Threat to CFPB Spotlights Massive Stakes of New Supreme Court Term |url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/cfpb-supreme-court |access-date=15 November 2023 |work=www.commondreams.org |date=2 October 2023 |language=en}}</ref> May 2024, the Court ruled for the CFPB in a 7-2 decision written by Justice [[Clarence Thomas]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 16, 2024|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/16/supreme-court-rules-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-funding-structure-is-legal.html|website=CNBC|title=Supreme Court Rules Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Funding Structure is Legal}}</ref>\n\n===2023 sanctioned over conduct===\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]] affirmed sanctions levied by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau due to its conduct during discovery.<ref>{{cite web |title=Evasive Deposition Tactics by the CFPB Supported Dismissal as a Sanction, Affirmed by Eleventh Circuit |url=https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/evasive-deposition-tactics-by-the-cfpb-4375456/ |website=JD Supra |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==List of directors==\n; Status\n{{legend|#FAF0E6|Special Advisor|border=black}}\n{{legend|#E6E6AA|Acting Director|border=black}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:right; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!No.\n!
