However, there has also been criticism over human rights violations and environmental impact, as well as concerns of [[debt-trap diplomacy]] resulting in [[neocolonialism]] and economic imperialism.\n\n==Objectives==\n===Background===\n{{Main|China's peaceful rise|Chinese Century|Beijing Consensus|Chinese Dream}}\nThe initiative was unveiled by [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and [[paramount leader]] [[Xi Jinping]] in September and October 2013 during visits to [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Indonesia]],<ref name=\"xinhua-chronology\"/> and was thereafter promoted by [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese premier]] [[Li Keqiang]] during [[state visit]]s to Asia and Europe. The initiative was given intensive coverage by [[Media of China#Official media channels|Chinese state media]], and by 2016 had become often featured in the ''[[People's Daily]]''.<ref name=\"AutoLT-3\"/>{{Citation needed|date=November 2020|reason=Dead link to user-generated content}}\n\nThe stated objectives are \"to construct a unified large market and make full use of both international and domestic markets, through [[cultural exchange]] and integration, to enhance mutual understanding and trust of member nations, resulting in an innovative pattern of capital inflows, [[talent pool]]s, and technology databases.\"<ref name=\"uniview\"/> The Belt and Road Initiative addresses an \"infrastructure gap\" and thus has the potential to accelerate economic growth across the [[Asia Pacific]], Africa and [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. A report from the [[World Pensions & Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] estimates that Asia, excluding China, requires up to US$900&nbsp;billion of infrastructure investments per year over the next decade, mostly in debt instruments, 50% above current infrastructure spending rates.<ref name=\"World Bank blog\"/> The gaping need for long term capital explains why many Asian and Eastern European heads of state \"gladly expressed their interest to join this new international financial institution focusing solely on 'real assets' and infrastructure-driven economic growth\".<ref name=\"Analyse Financi\u00e8re\"/>\n\nThe initial focus has been infrastructure investment, education, construction materials, railway and highway, automobile, real estate, power grid, and iron and steel.<ref name=\"AutoLT-4\"/> Already, some estimates list the Belt and Road Initiative as one of the largest infrastructure and investment projects in history, covering more than 68 countries, including 65% of the [[World population|world's population]] and 40% of the global gross domestic product as of 2017.<ref name=\"time_4776845\"/><ref name=\"cnn_20170511_asia\" /> The project builds on the old trade routes that once connected China to the west, [[Marco Polo]] and [[Ibn Battuta]]'s routes in the north and the maritime expedition routes of [[Ming dynasty]] admiral [[Zheng He]] in the south. The Belt and Road Initiative now refers to the entire geographical area of the historic \"[[Silk Road]]\" [[trade route]], which has been continuously used in antiquity.<ref name=\"AutoLT-5\"/> Development of the [[Renminbi]] as a currency of international transactions, development of the infrastructures of Asian countries, strengthening diplomatic relations whilst reducing dependency on the US and creating new markets for Chinese products, exporting surplus industrial capacity, and integrating commodities-rich countries more closely into the Chinese economy are all objectives of the BRI.<ref name=\"dhakatribune_20171031_one\"/>\n\nWhile some countries, especially the United States, view the project critically because of possible Chinese influence, others point to the creation of a new global growth engine by connecting and moving Asia, Europe and Africa closer together.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}\n\nThe [[G7]] industrial country [[Italy]] has been a partner in the development of the project since March 2019. According to estimates, the entire project today affects more than 60% of the world's population and approximately 35% of the global economy. Trade along the Silk Road could soon account for almost 40% of total world trade, with a large part being by sea. The land route of the Silk Road also appears to remain a niche project in terms of transport volume in the future.<ref name=\"AutoLT-6\"/>\n\nIn the maritime silk road, which is already the route for more than half of all containers in the world, deepwater ports are being expanded, logistical hubs are being built and new traffic routes are being created in the hinterland. The maritime silk road runs with its connections from the Chinese coast to the south via [[Hanoi]] to [[Jakarta]], Singapore and [[Kuala Lumpur]] through the Strait of Malacca via the Sri Lankan [[Colombo]] towards the southern tip of India via [[Mal\u00e9]], the capital of the Maldives, to the East African [[Mombasa]], from there to Djibouti, then through the Red Sea via the [[Suez Canal]] to the Mediterranean, there via [[Haifa]], [[Istanbul]] and [[Athens]] to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of [[Trieste]] with its international free port and its rail connections to Central Europe and the [[North Sea]].<ref name=\"AutoLT-7\"/><ref name=\"AutoLT-8\"/><ref name=\"AutoLT-9\"/><ref name=\"AutoLT-10\"/>\n\nAs a result, [[Poland]], the [[Baltic States]], Northern Europe, and Central Europe are also connected to the maritime silk road and logistically linked to East Africa, [[India]] and China via the [[Adriatic]] ports and [[Piraeus]]. All in all, the ship connections for container transports between Asia and Europe will be reorganized. In contrast to the longer East Asian traffic via north-west Europe, the southern sea route through the Suez Canal towards the junction Trieste shortens the goods transport by at least four days.<ref name=\"AutoLT-11\"/><ref name=\"AutoLT-12\"/><ref name=\"AutoLT-13\"/>\n\nIn connection with the Silk Road project, China is also trying to network worldwide research activities.<ref name=\"AutoLT-14\"/>\n\nSimon Shen and Wilson Chan have compare the initiative to the post-World War II Marshall Plan.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Shen |first1=Simon |last2=Chan |first2=Wilson |date=2018-03-27 |title=A comparative study of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Marshall plan |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0077-9 |journal=Palgrave Communications |language=en |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201311 |doi=10.1057/s41599-018-0077-9 |s2cid=4387434 |issn=2055-1045}}</ref>\n\n=== Project name ===\nThe official name for the initiative is the ''Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road Development Strategy'' ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u4e1d\u7ef8\u4e4b\u8def\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5e26\u548c21\u4e16\u7eaa\u6d77\u4e0a\u4e1d\u7ef8\u4e4b\u8def\u53d1\u5c55\u6218\u7565}}),<ref name=\"cbbc_20170713\"/> which was initially abbreviated as the ''One Belt One Road'' ({{zh|c=\u4e00\u5e26\u4e00\u8def|link=no}}) or the ''OBOR'' strategy.

This concerns the networked nature of financial centers and the vital role of advanced business services (e.g. law and accounting) that bring agents and sites into view (such as law firms, financial regulators, and offshore centers) that are generally less visible in geopolitical analysis, but vital in the financing of BRI.<ref name=\"AutoLT-29\"/>\n\nThe [[COVID-19 pandemic]] has stopped work on some projects{{Which|date=July 2021}}, while some have been scrapped; focus has been brought on projects that were already of questionable economic viability before the pandemic. Many{{Weasel inline|date=July 2021}} of the loans agreed upon are in or nearing technical default, as many debtor countries reliant on exporting commodities have seen a slump in demand for them. Some debtor countries have started to negotiate to defer payments falling due.<ref name=\":0\" /> In particular, the African continent owes an estimated $145&nbsp;billion, much of which involves BRI projects, with $8bn falling due in 2020.

Interest on Chinese loans continued to accrue during the freeze. In June 2020, Chinese leader Xi Jinping decided to cancel interest-free loans for certain African countries. Since 2000, these types of loans have accounted for 2 to 3 percent of total loans China has issued to African countries. Furthermore, foreign aid is a controversial topic in China due to it having its own areas with significant poverty.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sun|first=Yun|date=2015-10-08|title=The domestic controversy over China's foreign aid and the implications for Africa|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2015/10/08/the-domestic-controversy-over-chinas-foreign-aid-and-the-implications-for-africa/|access-date=2021-04-08|website=Brookings|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure networks==\nThe Belt and Road Initiative is about improving the physical infrastructure through land corridors that roughly equate to the old Silk Road.

Besides a zone largely analogous to the historical Silk Road, an expansion includes South Asia and Southeast Asia.\n\nMany of the countries in this belt are also members of the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).\n\nThree belts are proposed. The North belt would go through Central Asia and Russia to Europe. The Central belt passes through Central Asia and West Asia to the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Mediterranean]]. The South belt runs from China through Southeast Asia and South Asia and on to the Indian Ocean through Pakistan. The strategy will integrate China with Central Asia through Kazakhstan's [[Nurly Zhol]] infrastructure program.<ref name=\"EUreporterNZ\"/>\n\n===21st Century Maritime Silk Road===\n{{Main|21st Century Maritime Silk Road}}\nThe \"21st Century Maritime Silk Road\" (Chinese:21\u4e16\u7eaa\u6d77\u4e0a\u4e1d\u7ef8\u4e4b\u8def), or just the Maritime Silk Road, is the sea route 'corridor.'{{r|what}} It is a complementary initiative aimed at investing and fostering collaboration in Southeast Asia, Oceania and Africa through several contiguous bodies of water: the [[South China Sea]], the [[South Pacific Ocean]], and the wider Indian Ocean area.<ref name=\"AutoLT-18\"/><ref name=\"AutoLT-19\"/><ref name=\"ciis7231376\"/> It was first proposed in October 2013 by Xi Jinping in a speech to the [[People's Representative Council|Indonesian Parliament]].<ref name=\"chinadaily17008940\"/> As with the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative, most member countries have joined the [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]].\n\nThe maritime Silk Road runs with its links from the Chinese coast to the south via [[Hanoi]] to [[Jakarta]], Singapore and [[Kuala Lumpur]] through the [[Strait of Malacca]] via the Sri Lankan [[Colombo]] opposite the southern tip of India via [[Mal\u00e9]], the capital of the Maldives, to the East African [[Mombasa]], from there to [[Djibouti]], then through the Red Sea over the [[Suez Canal]] into the Mediterranean, there via [[Haifa]], [[Istanbul]] and [[Athens]] to the Upper Adriatic to the northern Italian junction of [[Trieste]] with its international free port and its rail connections to Central Europe and the [[North Sea]].\n[[File:Port of Shanghai, Yangshan Deep-water Harbour Zone, 02.jpg|left|thumb|Yangshan Port of Shanghai, China]]\n[[File:Kwai Tsing Container Terminals.jpg|thumb|Container terminals in Kwai Chung, Hong Kong]]\nAccording to estimates in 2019, the land route of the Silk Road remains a niche project and the bulk of the Silk Road trade continues to be carried out by sea. The reasons are primarily due to the cost of container transport. The maritime Silk Road is also considered to be particularly attractive for trade because, in contrast to the land-based Silk Road leading through the sparsely populated Central Asia, there are on the one hand far more states on the way to Europe and, on the other hand, their markets, development opportunities, and population numbers are far larger. In particular, there are many land-based links such as the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor (BCIM). Due to the attractiveness of this now subsidized sea route and the related investments, there have been major shifts in the logistics chains of the shipping sector in recent years.<ref>Bernhard Simon: Die nat\u00fcrlichen Grenzen der Neuen Seidenstra\u00dfe.

Concrete projects (as well as their financing), which are to ensure the connection of the Mediterranean ports with the European hinterland, are decided among others at the annual China-Central-East-Europe summit, which was launched in 2012. This applies, for example, to the expansion of the Belgrade-Budapest railway line, the construction of the high-speed train between Milan, Venice and Trieste<ref>[https://www.stol.it/artikel/wirtschaft/italien-will-in-schnellere-bahnverbindung-triest-venedig-investieren Italy wants to invest in a faster train connection from Trieste to Venice]</ref> and connections on the Adriatic-Baltic and Adriatic-North Sea axis. [[Poland]], the [[Baltic States]], Northern Europe and Central Europe are also connected to the maritime Silk Road through many links and are thus logistically networked via the Adriatic ports and Piraeus to East Africa, [[India]] and China. Overall, the ship connections for container transports between Asia and Europe will be reorganized. In contrast to the longer East Asia traffic via northwest Europe, the south-facing sea route through the [[Suez Canal]] towards the Trieste bridgehead shortens the transport of goods by at least four days.<ref>Gerald Pohl: Neue Seidenstra\u00dfe: China dr\u00e4ngt es nach Europa ''Die Presse'', 17 September 2019; Hafen Triest auf Wachstumskurs: Neue Bahnverbindung nach Rostock.

The example of [[Munich]] shows that the transport there from Shanghai via Trieste takes 33 days, while the northern route takes 43 days. From Hong Kong, the southern route reduces transport to Munich from 37 to 28 days. The shorter transport means, on the one hand, better use of the liner ships for the shipping companies and, on the other hand, considerable ecological advantages, also with regard to the lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, because shipping is a heavy burden on the climate. Therefore, in the Mediterranean area, where the economic zone of the [[Liverpool\u2013Milan Axis]] meets functioning railroad connections and deep-water ports, there are significant growth zones. Henning V\u00f6pel, Director of the Hamburg World Economic Institute, recognizes that the North Range (i.e. transport via the North Sea ports to Europe) is not necessarily the one that will remain dominant in the medium term.<ref>Triest \u2013 Ein Welthafen f\u00fcr Bayern, In: Bayrische Staatszeitung 30 November 2018; Marcus Hernig: Die Renaissance der Seidenstra\u00dfe (2018), p 112; Bruno Macaes: China's Italian advance threatens EU unity.

The port of Trieste, next to Gioia Tauro the only deep water port in the central Mediterranean for container ships of the seventh generation, is therefore a special target for Chinese investments. In March 2019, the [[China Communications Construction Company]] (CCCC) signed agreements to promote the ports of Trieste and Genoa. Accordingly, the port's annual handling capacity will be increased from 10,000 to 25,000 trains in Trieste (Trihub project) and a reciprocal platform to promote and handle trade between Europe and China will be created. It is also about logistics promotion between the North Adriatic port and Shanghai or [[Guangdong]]. This also includes a state Hungarian investment of 100 million euros for a 32 hectare logistics center and funding from the [[European Union]] of 45 million euros in 2020 for the development of the railway system in the port city.<ref>\"Trieste, ex Aquila venduta all'ungherese Adria Port\" ''Il Piccolo'', 18 December 2020.</ref> Furthermore, the Hamburg port logistics group [[HHLA]] invested in the logistics platform of the port of Trieste (PLT) in September 2020.<ref>Matteo Bressan: Opportunities and challenges for BRI in Europe in Global Time, 2 April 2019; Andreas Deutsch: Verlagerungseffekte im containerbasierten Hinterlandverkehr (2014), p 143; Johnny Erling: Peking streckt die Hand nach italienischen H\u00e4fen aus ''Die Welt'', 21 March 2019; Alexander Zwagerman: The eternal city welcomes the eternal Red Emperor: Italy's embrace of Beijing is a headache for its partners, ''Hong Kong Free Press'', 31 March 2019; Guido Santevecchi: Di Maio e la Via della Seta: \u00abFaremo i conti nel 2020\u00bb, siglato accordo su Trieste in Corriere della Sera: 5 November 2019; Trieste to become Hungary's sea exit, The Budapest Business Journal, 21 June 2019; \"Hamburger Hafenkonzern investiert gro\u00df in Triest\" in Die Presse 29 September 2020; Linda Vierecke, Elisabetta Galla \"Triest und die neue Seidenstra\u00dfe\" Deutsche Welle, 8 December 2020.</ref> In 2020, Duisburger Hafen AG (Duisport), the world's largest intermodal terminal operator, took a 15% stake in the Trieste freight terminal.<ref>\"Logistica, il colosso Duisport acquisisce il 15% delle quote dell'Interporto di Trieste\" ''Il Piccolo'', 15 December 2020.</ref> There are also further contacts between Hamburg, Bremen and Trieste with regard to cooperation.<ref>[https://nordesteconomia.gelocal.it/infrastrutture/2021/01/31/news/verso-il-colosso-ue-dei-container-amburgo-brema-un-faro-su-trieste-1.39843003 On the way to the EU container giant Hamburg-Bremen.
