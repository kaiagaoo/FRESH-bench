Initiated as part of China's broader strategy to engage in global health governance, the HSR seeks to improve healthcare facilities, enhance disease prevention, and strengthen healthcare cooperation across participating countries. The initiative includes the construction of healthcare facilities, such as hospitals in Pakistan and Laos, and collaborative programs with global organizations like the World Health Organization. [[Shaoyu Yuan]] finds that while the HSR contributes to health sector improvements in participating nations, it also prompts discussions regarding the long-term debt sustainability and the transparency of project execution.

The reasons are primarily due to the cost of container transport. The maritime Silk Road is also considered to be particularly attractive for trade because, in contrast to the land-based Silk Road leading through the sparsely populated Central Asia, there are on the one hand, far more states on the way to Europe and, on the other hand, their markets, development opportunities, and population numbers are far larger. In particular, there are many land-based links, such as the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor (BCIM). Due to the attractiveness of this now subsidized sea route and the related investments, there have been major shifts in the logistics chains of the shipping sector in recent years.<ref>Bernhard Simon: Die nat\u00fcrlichen Grenzen der Neuen Seidenstra\u00dfe.

To the northeast of Mombasa, a large port with 32 berths including an adjacent industrial area including infrastructure with new traffic corridors to [[South Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]] is being built. A modern deep-water port, a satellite city, an airfield and an industrial area are being built in [[Bagamoyo]], Tanzania.

In several countries, such as [[Zambia]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Ghana]], dams have been built with Chinese help. In Nairobi, China is funding the construction of the tallest building in Africa, the Pinnacle Towers.

Concrete projects (as well as their financing), which are to ensure the connection of the Mediterranean ports with the European hinterland, are decided among others at the annual China-Central-East-Europe summit, which was launched in 2012. This applies, for example, to the expansion of the Belgrade-Budapest railway line, the construction of the high-speed train between Milan, Venice and Trieste<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stol.it/artikel/wirtschaft/italien-will-in-schnellere-bahnverbindung-triest-venedig-investieren|title=Italien will in schnellere Bahnverbindung Triest-Venedig investieren|website=stol.it|access-date=10 February 2021|archive-date=9 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210209173547/https://www.stol.it/artikel/wirtschaft/italien-will-in-schnellere-bahnverbindung-triest-venedig-investieren|url-status=live}}</ref> and connections on the Adriatic-Baltic and Adriatic-North Sea axis. [[Poland]], the [[Baltic States]], Northern Europe and Central Europe are also connected to the maritime Silk Road through many links and are thus logistically networked via the Adriatic ports and Piraeus to East Africa, [[India]] and China. Overall, the ship connections for container transport between Asia and Europe will be reorganized. In contrast to the longer East Asia traffic via northwest Europe, the south-facing sea route through the [[Suez Canal]] towards the Trieste bridgehead shortens the transport of goods by at least four days.<ref>Gerald Pohl: Neue Seidenstra\u00dfe: China dr\u00e4ngt es nach Europa ''Die Presse'', 17 September 2019; Hafen Triest auf Wachstumskurs: Neue Bahnverbindung nach Rostock.

The example of [[Munich]] shows that the transport there from Shanghai via Trieste takes 33 days, while the northern route takes 43 days. From Hong Kong, the southern route reduces transport to Munich from 37 to 28 days. The shorter transport means, on the one hand, better use of the liner ships for the shipping companies and, on the other hand, considerable ecological advantages, also with regard to the lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, because shipping is a heavy burden on the climate. Therefore, in the Mediterranean area, where the economic zone of the [[Liverpool\u2013Milan Axis]] meets functioning railroad connections and deep-water ports, there are significant growth zones. Henning V\u00f6pel, Director of the Hamburg World Economic Institute, recognizes that the North Range (i.e. transport via the North Sea ports to Europe) is not necessarily the one that will remain dominant in the medium term.<ref>Triest \u2013 Ein Welthafen f\u00fcr Bayern, In: Bayrische Staatszeitung 30 November 2018; Marcus Hernig: Die Renaissance der Seidenstra\u00dfe (2018), p 112; Bruno Macaes: China's Italian advance threatens EU unity.

The port of Trieste, next to Gioia Tauro the only deep water port in the central Mediterranean for container ships of the seventh generation, is therefore a special target for Chinese investments. In March 2019, the [[China Communications Construction Company]] (CCCC) signed agreements to promote the ports of Trieste and Genoa. Accordingly, the port's annual handling capacity will be increased from 10,000 to 25,000 trains in Trieste (Trihub project) and a reciprocal platform to promote and handle trade between Europe and China will be created. It is also about logistics promotion between the North Adriatic port and Shanghai or [[Guangdong]]. This also includes a state Hungarian investment of 100 million euros for a 32 hectare logistics center and funding from the [[European Union]] of 45 million euros in 2020 for the development of the railway system in the port city.<ref>\"Trieste, ex Aquila venduta all'ungherese Adria Port\" ''Il Piccolo'', 18 December 2020.</ref> Furthermore, the Hamburg port logistics group [[HHLA]] invested in the logistics platform of the port of Trieste (PLT) in September 2020.<ref>Matteo Bressan: Opportunities and challenges for BRI in Europe in Global Time, 2 April 2019; Andreas Deutsch: Verlagerungseffekte im containerbasierten Hinterlandverkehr (2014), p 143; Johnny Erling: Peking streckt die Hand nach italienischen H\u00e4fen aus ''Die Welt'', 21 March 2019; Alexander Zwagerman: The eternal city welcomes the eternal Red Emperor: Italy's embrace of Beijing is a headache for its partners, ''Hong Kong Free Press'', 31 March 2019; Guido Santevecchi: Di Maio e la Via della Seta: \u00abFaremo i conti nel 2020\u00bb, siglato accordo su Trieste in Corriere della Sera: 5 November 2019; Trieste to become Hungary's sea exit, The Budapest Business Journal, 21 June 2019; \"Hamburger Hafenkonzern investiert gro\u00df in Triest\" in Die Presse 29 September 2020; Linda Vierecke, Elisabetta Galla \"Triest und die neue Seidenstra\u00dfe\" Deutsche Welle, 8 December 2020.</ref> In 2020, Duisburger Hafen AG (Duisport), the world's largest intermodal terminal operator, took a 15% stake in the Trieste freight terminal.<ref>\"Logistica, il colosso Duisport acquisisce il 15% delle quote dell'Interporto di Trieste\" ''Il Piccolo'', 15 December 2020.</ref> There are also further contacts between Hamburg, Bremen and Trieste with regard to cooperation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nordesteconomia.gelocal.it/infrastrutture/2021/01/31/news/verso-il-colosso-ue-dei-container-amburgo-brema-un-faro-su-trieste-1.39843003|title=Verso il colosso Ue dei container Amburgo-Brema.
