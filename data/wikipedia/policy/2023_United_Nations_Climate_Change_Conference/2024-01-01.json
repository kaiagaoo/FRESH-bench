For having a more than 50% chance of limiting temperature rise to 1.5&nbsp;\u00b0C and more than 67% chance of limiting it to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C, global emissions must peak by the year 2025.\n\n* Trillions of dollars are needed for limiting warming to 1.5&nbsp;\u00b0C. Financial flows need to significantly change.\n\n* More effective international cooperation and collaboration are crucial for reaching the targets of the Paris Agreement.\n\n== Reception ==\nAs the host country, the UAE named Sultan Al Jaber as president-designate of COP28 in January 2023.<ref>{{Cite news |date=12 January 2023 |title=COP28 UAE: Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber named President-Designate |work=Gulf Business |url=https://gulfbusiness.com/cop28-uae-dr-sultan-al-jaber-is-pres-designate/ |url-status=live |access-date=2023-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230223190158/https://gulfbusiness.com/cop28-uae-dr-sultan-al-jaber-is-pres-designate/ |archive-date=2023-02-23 |author-last=Salian |author-first=Neesha}}</ref> His appointment was criticised by Western lawmakers due to him being the CEO of [[Abu Dhabi National Oil Company]] (ADNOC).<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news |date=2023-05-28 |title=US and EU lawmakers call for UAE to remove Jaber from UN climate role |language=en |work=The Financial Times |url=https://www.ft.com/content/34fb5016-d9f4-4d4d-9bb4-174bfcadbe77 |url-status=live |access-date=2023-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102225119/https://www.ft.com/content/34fb5016-d9f4-4d4d-9bb4-174bfcadbe77 |archive-date=2020-01-02 |author-last=Bikales |author-first=James}}</ref> 99 members of the European Parliament and 34 US senators and representatives wrote an open letter, addressed to US President [[Joe Biden]] and European Commission President [[Ursula von der Leyen]], to call the UAE to withdraw Al Jaber's appointment.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite news |date=2023-05-23 |title=COP28 chief under fire from EU and US lawmakers over oil ties |language=en |work=Politico |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/sultan-al-aber-united-nations-cop28-chief-under-fire-for-oil-ties-from-eu-and-us-lawmakers/ |url-status=live |access-date=2023-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102225119/https://www.politico.eu/article/sultan-al-aber-united-nations-cop28-chief-under-fire-for-oil-ties-from-eu-and-us-lawmakers/ |archive-date=2020-01-02 |author-last=Weise |author-first=Zia}}</ref> Signatory US lawmakers included [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Elizabeth Warren]].

The document included \"strategic messages\" approved by the Emirati government, which were to be used as a reply to the media. The document highlighted that the country would defend ADNOC's failure to disclose its emissions since 2016 by saying that \"ADNOC is currently conducting necessary studies\". Besides, the document also mentioned that questions on Sultan Al Jaber's presidency will be answered with, \"Dr. Sultan's full circle career [in energy, climate, and diplomacy] gives him the expertise needed to constructively engage, disrupt, and unite the very sectors needed to achieve meaningful action.\"<ref>{{Cite news |author-last=Carrington |author-first=Damian |date=2023-08-01 |title=Leak reveals 'touchy' issues for UAE's presidency of UN climate summit |language=en |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/01/leak-uae-presidency-un-climate-summit-oil-gas-emissions-yemen |access-date=2023-08-01 |archive-date=2023-08-01  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230801102601/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/01/leak-uae-presidency-un-climate-summit-oil-gas-emissions-yemen |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe UAE hired a US-based PR firm, First International Resources, to \"counteract all negative press and media reports\" around the Gulf state as a COP28 host.

On 4 August 2023, the company registered under the United States [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] to represent [[Masdar]]. According to the filings, the PR firm was supposed to seek to \"reinforce attitudes among decision-makers in Washington DC, and across Europe regarding the strategic value of the UAE in the global fight to address climate change\". The UAE was to pay First International Resources a monthly retainer fee of $100,000. Fossil Free Media founder and director Jamie Henn said such an amount is not paid to a PR firm \"when you're confident about your public image\".

According to the rights group, in September 2023, a dozen migrant workers from Asia and Africa were working outdoors in temperatures hitting 42&nbsp;\u00b0C (107.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) despite a midday ban. COP28 denied the allegations and claimed that no evidence of the midday ban's breach was found. A worksite supervisor said most of the work is done at night, but some has to be done whenever possible.

Amnesty's view of the UAE's promise to offer a \"platform for activists' voices\" would be unachievable without respect for the human rights of privacy and the right of peaceful assembly. Amnesty opposed the \"unlawful electronic surveillance of conference participants [and of] Emirati nationals and residents\".

McKinsey has been accused of putting its own interests ahead of the climate by sources involved in preparatory meetings for COP28. McKinsey's energy scenario for the COP28 presidency would allow for continued investment in fossil fuels, which would undermine the goals of the [[Paris Agreement]]; an \"energy transition narrative\" recommends oil use to be reduced by only 50% by 2050, and that trillions of dollars should continue to be invested in high-emission assets each year to at least 2050.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top consultancy McKinsey undermining climate change fight: whistleblowers |date=12 November 2023 |url=https://japantoday.com/category/features/environment/top-consultancy-mckinsey-undermining-climate-change-fight-whistleblowers |access-date=2023-11-14  |archive-date=2023-11-14  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231114083742/https://japantoday.com/category/features/environment/top-consultancy-mckinsey-undermining-climate-change-fight-whistleblowers |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn 27 November 2023, the Centre for Climate Reporting and [[BBC News]] reported that based on leaked documents, the UAE intended to use COP28 as a platform to discuss fossil fuel deals with 15 countries, including a deal with China to \"jointly evaluate international [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] opportunities\" in Mozambique, Canada and Australia.

Described as \"incredibly concerning\" and bordering on climate denial, his comments contradict the stance of UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. The remarks were made during a confrontational exchange with Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group, at a live online event on November 21. ''The Times'' noted widespread condemnation of Al Jaber's statements at COP28, where numerous countries, including the UK and EU members, advocated for the phased reduction of unabated fossil fuels. In contrast, former US vice president Al Gore emphasized the historical significance of a potential COP28 agreement to phase out fossil fuels, considering it one of the most crucial events in human history. Simultaneously, BBC News reported a substantial increase in the United Arab Emirates' oil production, with Adnoc, the state oil firm, projected to drill 42% more by 2030. Despite this, Adnoc claims it aims to enhance climate-friendliness, including venturing into renewable energy, amid the global call for fossil fuel reduction.<ref>{{Cite web |title=COP28 president says there is 'no science' behind demands for phase-out of fossil fuels |url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/cop28-president-says-there-is-no-science-behind-demands-for-phase-out-of-fossil-fuels/ |access-date=2023-12-13 |website=Carbon Brief |language=en |archive-date=2023-12-04  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231204131434/https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/cop28-president-says-there-is-no-science-behind-demands-for-phase-out-of-fossil-fuels/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Carbon footprint ===\nSeveral commentators criticised the fact that COP28 had over 70,000 accredited attendees,<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> as well as the use of private jets by many figures to attend.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-30 |title=Sunak, Cameron and King Charles each take own private jets to travel to Cop28 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/king-charles-sunak-cameron-cop28-private-jets-b2456050.html |access-date=2023-12-04 |website=The Independent |language=en |archive-date=2023-12-02  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231202005442/https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/king-charles-sunak-cameron-cop28-private-jets-b2456050.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Carole |last2=Maslin |first2=Mark |last3=Parikh |first3=Prof Priti |date=2023-12-01 |title=Why are people still flying to climate conferences by private jet? |url=http://theconversation.com/why-are-people-still-flying-to-climate-conferences-by-private-jet-218459 |access-date=2023-12-04 |website=The Conversation |language=en-US |archive-date=2023-12-04  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231204222512/http://theconversation.com/why-are-people-still-flying-to-climate-conferences-by-private-jet-218459 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-11-30 |title=Do 70,000 People Really Need to Be at a Climate Confab? |language=en |work=Bloomberg.com |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-30/cop28-do-70-000-people-really-need-to-be-at-a-climate-confab |access-date=2023-12-04 |archive-date=2023-11-30  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231130151030/http://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-30/cop28-do-70-000-people-really-need-to-be-at-a-climate-confab |url-status=live }}</ref> The meeting is estimated to have the largest carbon footprint of any climate summit.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gatten |first=Emma |date=2023-11-30 |title=UAE's Cop28 has 'biggest carbon footprint' of any climate summit |language=en-GB |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/11/30/uae-cop-has-biggest-carbon-footprint-of-any-climate-summit/ |access-date=2023-12-08 |issn=0307-1235 |archive-date=2023-12-08  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231208020028/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/11/30/uae-cop-has-biggest-carbon-footprint-of-any-climate-summit/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Suppression of protests===\nOn 11 December 2023, [[Licypriya Kangujam]], a climate activist from India, walked onto the main stage of the conference, held up a sign, \"End fossil fuels.
