After [[COP27]] it was 2.4\u20132.6&nbsp;\u00b0C and in the best case, if all pledges are accomplished, 1.7\u20132.1&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n* As of September 2023, the world is not on track to reach the targets of the Paris Agreement. For having a more than 50% chance of limiting temperature rise to 1.5&nbsp;\u00b0C and more than 67% chance of limiting it to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C, global emissions must peak by the year 2025.\n\n*

Agreement.\n\n=== Expectations ===\n[[Fatih Birol]], head of the [[International Energy Agency]], expressed hope for significant achievements at the summit but noted: \"[the] geopolitical situation,

FairSquare, a UK-based human rights group, released a report based on testimonies and photographs, stating that the migrant workers were being exposed to dangerously hot weather and humidity to prepare for the climate summit. According to the rights group, in September 2023, a dozen migrant workers from Asia and Africa were working outdoors in temperatures hitting {{cvt|42|C}} despite a midday ban. COP28 denied the allegations and claimed that no evidence of the midday ban's breach was found. A worksite supervisor said most of the work is done at night, but some has to be done whenever possible. A COP28 spokesperson said contractors were required to have worker heat safety plans and weather stations that monitor the [[Thermal work limit|Thermal Work Limit]], as well as taking into account heat and humidity metrics including wet and dry bulb temperature and wind speed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lakhani |first=Nina |title=Migrant workers toil in perilous heat to prepare for Cop28 climate talks in UAE |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/20/cop28-migrant-workers-uae-heat-climate-crisis |access-date=31 October 2023 |work=The Guardian |date=20 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231020071429/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/20/cop28-migrant-workers-uae-heat-climate-crisis |archive-date=20 October 2023}}</ref>\n\n=== Digital surveillance ===\nAhead of COP28, [[Amnesty International]] raised concerns that the UAE might continue to use digital surveillance to spy on human rights defenders and civil society members in the UAE, including the COP28 participants. According to Amnesty International's Disrupting Surveillance Team, the UAE had a record of using digital surveillance to \"crush dissents and stifle freedom of expression\". Amnesty's view of the UAE's promise to offer a \"platform for activists' voices\" would be unachievable without respect for the human rights of privacy and the right of peaceful assembly. Amnesty opposed the \"unlawful electronic surveillance of conference participants [and of] Emirati nationals and residents\". It said that the COP28 attendees should be allowed to download \"privacy-respecting international communications applications\" in the UAE that would ensure safe and encrypted means of communication.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-11-15 |title=UAE: Concerns around authorities' use of digital surveillance during COP28 |language=en |work=Amnesty International |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/11/uae-concerns-around-authorities-use-of-digital-surveillance-during-cop28/ |access-date=2023-11-23 |archive-date=2023-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231123124208/https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/11/uae-concerns-around-authorities-use-of-digital-surveillance-during-cop28/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"euronews 2023 e345\">{{cite web | title=COP28: Activists fear surveillance and arrests at Dubai climate summit | website=Euronews | date=2023-11-24 | url=https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/11/24/repressive-state-activists-raise-concerns-about-surveillance-and-arrest-at-cop28 | access-date=2023-11-29 | archive-date=2023-11-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231129024819/https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/11/24/repressive-state-activists-raise-concerns-about-surveillance-and-arrest-at-cop28 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Alleged fossil fuel deals===\nOn 7 November 2023, an [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] investigation revealed in multiple leaked documents that [[McKinsey & Company|McKinsey]] was using its position as the primary advisor to COP28 hosts, the [[United Arab Emirates]], to push the interest of its oil and gas clients ([[ExxonMobil climate change denial|ExxonMobil]] and [[Aramco]]). McKinsey has been accused of putting its own interests ahead of the climate by sources involved in preparatory meetings for COP28. McKinsey's energy scenario for the COP28 presidency would allow for continued investment in fossil fuels, which would undermine the goals of the [[Paris Agreement]]; an \"energy transition narrative\" recommends oil use to be reduced by only 50% by 2050, and that trillions of dollars should continue to be invested in high-emission assets each year to at least 2050.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top consultancy McKinsey undermining climate change fight: whistleblowers |date=12 November 2023 |url=https://japantoday.com/category/features/environment/top-consultancy-mckinsey-undermining-climate-change-fight-whistleblowers |access-date=2023-11-14 |archive-date=2023-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231114083742/https://japantoday.com/category/features/environment/top-consultancy-mckinsey-undermining-climate-change-fight-whistleblowers |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn 27 November 2023, the Centre for Climate Reporting and [[BBC News]] reported that based on leaked documents, the UAE intended to use COP28 as a platform to discuss fossil fuel deals with fifteen countries, including a deal with China to \"jointly evaluate international [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] opportunities\" in Mozambique, Canada and Australia.

Described as \"incredibly concerning\" and bordering on climate denial, his comments contradict the stance of UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. The remarks were made during a confrontational exchange with Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group, at a live online event on 21 November. ''The Times'' noted widespread condemnation of Al Jaber's statements at COP28, where numerous countries, including the UK and EU members, advocated for the phased reduction of unabated fossil fuels. In contrast, former US vice president Al Gore emphasised the historical significance of a potential COP28 agreement to phase out fossil fuels, considering it one of the most crucial events in human history. Simultaneously, BBC News reported a substantial increase in the United Arab Emirates' oil production, with ADNOC, the state oil firm, projected to drill 42% more by 2030. Despite this, ADNOC claims it aims to enhance climate-friendliness, including venturing into renewable energy, amid the global call for fossil fuel reduction.<ref>{{Cite web |title=COP28 president says there is 'no science' behind demands for phase-out of fossil fuels |url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/cop28-president-says-there-is-no-science-behind-demands-for-phase-out-of-fossil-fuels/ |access-date=2023-12-13 |website=Carbon Brief |language=en |archive-date=2023-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231204131434/https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/cop28-president-says-there-is-no-science-behind-demands-for-phase-out-of-fossil-fuels/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Suppression of protests===\nOn 11 December 2023, [[Licypriya Kangujam]], a climate activist from India, walked onto the main stage of the conference, held up a sign, \"End fossil fuels.
