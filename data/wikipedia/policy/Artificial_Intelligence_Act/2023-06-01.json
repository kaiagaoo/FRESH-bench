As a piece of product regulation, the proposal does not confer rights on individuals, but regulates the providers of artificial intelligence systems, and entities making use of them in a professional capacity.\n\nThe proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act aims to classify and regulate artificial intelligence applications based on their risk to cause harm. This classification primarily falls into three categories: banned practices, high-risk systems, and other AI systems.<ref name=\"Veale 2021\">{{Cite journal |last=Veale |first=Michael |date=2021 |title=Demystifying the Draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act |journal=Computer Law Review International |volume=22 |issue=4 |doi=10.31235/osf.io/38p5f |s2cid=241559535 }}</ref>\n\nBanned practices are those that employ artificial intelligence to cause subliminal manipulation or exploit people's vulnerabilities that may result in physical or psychological harm, make indiscriminate use of real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces for law enforcement, or use AI-derived 'social scores' by authorities to unfairly disadvantage individuals or groups. The Act entirely prohibits the latter, while an authorisation regime is proposed for the first three in the context of law enforcement.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mueller |first=Benjamin |date=2021-05-04 |title=The Artificial Intelligence Act: A Quick Explainer |url=https://datainnovation.org/2021/05/the-artificial-intelligence-act-a-quick-explainer/ |access-date=2021-11-14 |website=Center for Data Innovation |language=en-US |archive-date=14 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221014172842/http://datainnovation.org/2021/05/the-artificial-intelligence-act-a-quick-explainer/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHigh-risk systems, as per the Act, are those that pose significant threats to health, safety, or the fundamental rights of persons. They require a compulsory [[conformity assessment]], undertaken as self-assessment by the provider, before being launched in the market. Particularly critical applications, such as those for medical devices, require the provider's self-assessment under AI Act requirements to be considered by the [[notified body]] conducting the assessment under existing EU regulations, like the [[Regulation (EU) 2017/745|Medical Devices Regulation]].\n\nAI systems outside the categories above are not subject to any regulation, with Member States largely prevented from further regulating them via [[maximum harmonisation]]. Existing national laws related to the design or use of such systems are disapplied. However, a voluntary code of conduct for such systems is envisaged, though not from the outset.<ref name=\"Veale 2021\"/>\n\nThe Act further proposes the introduction of a European Artificial Intelligence Board to promote national cooperation and ensure compliance with the regulation.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Propp|first=Mark MacCarthy and Kenneth|date=2021-05-04|title=Machines learn that Brussels writes the rules: The EU's new AI regulation|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/05/04/machines-learn-that-brussels-writes-the-rules-the-eus-new-ai-regulation/|access-date=2021-09-07|website=Brookings|language=en-US|archive-date=27 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221027115538/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/05/04/machines-learn-that-brussels-writes-the-rules-the-eus-new-ai-regulation/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLike the European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]], the AI Act could become a global standard.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-09-07 |title=Home |url=https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/ |access-date=2022-02-17 |website=The Artificial Intelligence Act |language=en-US |archive-date=17 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220217115807/https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It is already having impact beyond Europe; in September 2021, Brazil\u2019s Congress passed a bill that creates a legal framework for artificial intelligence.<ref>{{Cite web |title=C\u00e2mara aprova projeto que regulamenta uso da intelig\u00eancia artificial - Not\u00edcias |url=https://www.camara.leg.br/noticias/811702-camara-aprova-projeto-que-regulamenta-uso-da-inteligencia-artificial/ |access-date=2022-02-17 |website=Portal da C\u00e2mara dos Deputados |language=pt-br |archive-date=17 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220217115806/https://www.camara.leg.br/noticias/811702-camara-aprova-projeto-que-regulamenta-uso-da-inteligencia-artificial/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The European Council adopted its general approach on the AI Act on 6 December 2022.<ref>{{cite web |title=Artificial Intelligence Act: Council calls for promoting safe AI that respects fundamental rights |url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/06/artificial-intelligence-act-council-calls-for-promoting-safe-ai-that-respects-fundamental-rights/#:~:text=The%20Council%20has%20adopted%20its,fundamental%20rights%20and%20Union%20values. |website=www.consilium.europa.eu |access-date=9 January 2023 |language=en |archive-date=9 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230109091701/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/06/artificial-intelligence-act-council-calls-for-promoting-safe-ai-that-respects-fundamental-rights/#:~:text=The%20Council%20has%20adopted%20its,fundamental%20rights%20and%20Union%20values. |url-status=live }}</ref> Germany supports the Council's position but still sees some need for further improvement as formulated in an accompanying statement by the member state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act) and amending certain Union legislative acts General approach - Statement by Germany |url=https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14954-2022-ADD-1/en/pdf |website=www.data.consilium.europa.eu |access-date=9 January 2023 |archive-date=27 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230127144123/https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14954-2022-ADD-1/en/pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Among the measures likely to be proposed is for AI developers for products such as Open AI's [[ChatGPT]] to declare whether copyrighted material was used to train their technology.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-04-14 |title=European parliament prepares tough measures over use of artificial intelligence |work=Financial Times |url=https://www.ft.com/content/addb5a77-9ad0-4fea-8ffb-8e2ae250a95a |access-date=2023-04-14 |archive-date=14 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414145058/https://www.ft.com/content/addb5a77-9ad0-4fea-8ffb-8e2ae250a95a |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Enforcement ==\nThe Act regulates the entry to the EU internal market. To this extent it uses the New Legislative Framework, which can be traced back to the New Approach which dates back to 1985. How this works is as follows: The EU legislator creates the AI-act, this Act contains the most important provisions that all AI-systems that want access to the EU internal market will have to comply with. These requirements are called 'essential requirements'. Under the New Legislative Framework, these essential requirements are passed on to European Standardisation Organisations who draw up technical standards that further specify the essential requirements.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Act requires Member States to set up their own notifying bodies. To check whether AI-systems are indeed conform the standards as set out in the AI-Act conformity assessment takes place.<ref>{{Cite web |title=EUR-Lex - 52021SC0084 - EN - EUR-Lex |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021SC0084 |access-date=2023-04-17 |website=eur-lex.europa.eu |language=en |archive-date=17 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230417093353/https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52021SC0084 |url-status=live }}</ref> This conformity assessment is either done by self-assessment, which means that the provider of the AI-system checks for conformity themselves, or this is done through third party conformity assessment which means that the notifying body will carry out the assessment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Veale |first=Michael |last2=Borgesius |first2=Frederik Zuiderveen |date=2021-08-01 |title=Demystifying the Draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act \u2014 Analysing the good, the bad, and the unclear elements of the proposed approach |url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.9785/cri-2021-220402/html |journal=Computer Law Review International |language=en |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=97\u2013112 |doi=10.9785/cri-2021-220402 |issn=2194-4164 |access-date=17 April 2023 |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326063315/https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.9785/cri-2021-220402/html |url-status=live }}</ref> Notifying bodies do retain the possibility to carry out audits to check whether conformity assessment is carried out properly.<ref name=fc>{{Cite journal |last=Casarosa |first=Federica |date=2022-06-01 |title=Cybersecurity certification of Artificial Intelligence: a missed opportunity to coordinate between the Artificial Intelligence Act and the Cybersecurity Act |url=https://doi.org/10.1365/s43439-021-00043-6 |journal=International Cybersecurity Law Review |language=en |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=115\u2013130 |doi=10.1365/s43439-021-00043-6 |issn=2662-9739}}</ref>\n\nUnder the current proposal it seems to be the case that many high-risk AI-systems do not require third party conformity assessment which is critiqued by some.<ref name=fc /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Smuha |first=Nathalie A. |last2=Ahmed-Rengers |first2=Emma |last3=Harkens |first3=Adam |last4=Li |first4=Wenlong |last5=MacLaren |first5=James |last6=Piselli |first6=Riccardo |last7=Yeung |first7=Karen |date=2021-08-05 |title=How the EU Can Achieve Legally Trustworthy AI: A Response to the European Commission\u2019s Proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3899991 |language=en |location=Rochester, NY |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3899991}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almada |first=Marco |last2=Petit |first2=Nicolas |date=2022-12-20 |title=The EU AI Act: Between Product Safety and Fundamental Rights |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4308072 |language=en |location=Rochester, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ebers |first=Martin |last2=Hoch |first2=Veronica R.
