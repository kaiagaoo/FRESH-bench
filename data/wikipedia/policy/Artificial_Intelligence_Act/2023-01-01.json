Its scope encompasses all sectors (except for military), and to all types of artificial intelligence. As a piece of product regulation, the proposal does not confer rights on individuals, but regulates the providers of artificial intelligence systems, and entities making use of them in a professional capacity.\n\nThe proposed regulation classifies artificial intelligence applications by risk, and regulates them accordingly. Low-risk applications are not regulated at all, with Member States largely precluded via [[maximum harmonisation]] from regulating them further and existing national laws relating to the regulation of design or use of such systems disapplied.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Veale |first=Michael |date=2021 |title=Demystifying the Draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act |url=doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/38p5f |journal=Computer Law Review International |volume=22 |issue=4|doi=10.31235/osf.io/38p5f |s2cid=241559535 }}</ref> A voluntary code of conduct scheme for such low risk systems is envisaged, although not present from the outset. Medium and high-risk systems would require compulsory [[conformity assessment]], undertaken as self-assessment by the provider, before being put on the market. Some especially critical applications which already require conformity assessment to be supervised under existing EU law, for example for medical devices, would the provider's self-assessment under AI Act requirements to be considered by the [[notified body]] conducting the assessment under that regulation, such as the [[Regulation (EU) 2017/745|Medical Devices Regulation]].\n\nThe proposal also would place prohibitions on certain types of applications, namely remote biometric recognition, applications that subliminally manipulate persons, applications that exploit vulnerabilities of certain groups in a harmful way, and social credit scoring. For the first three, an authorisation regime context of law enforcement is proposed, but social scoring would be banned completely.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mueller|first=Benjamin|date=2021-05-04|title=The Artificial Intelligence Act: A Quick Explainer|url=https://datainnovation.org/2021/05/the-artificial-intelligence-act-a-quick-explainer/|access-date=2021-11-14|website=Center for Data Innovation|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe act also proposes the introduction of a European Artificial Intelligence Board which will encourage national cooperation and ensure that the regulation is respected.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Propp|first=Mark MacCarthy and Kenneth|date=2021-05-04|title=Machines learn that Brussels writes the rules: The EU's new AI regulation|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/05/04/machines-learn-that-brussels-writes-the-rules-the-eus-new-ai-regulation/|access-date=2021-09-07|website=Brookings|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nLike the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the AI Act could become a global standard.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-09-07|title=Home|url=https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/|access-date=2022-02-17|website=The Artificial Intelligence Act|language=en-US}}</ref> It is already having impact beyond Europe; in September 2021, Brazil\u2019s Congress passed a bill that creates a legal framework for artificial intelligence.<ref>{{Cite web|title=C\u00e2mara aprova projeto que regulamenta uso da intelig\u00eancia artificial - Not\u00edcias|url=https://www.camara.leg.br/noticias/811702-camara-aprova-projeto-que-regulamenta-uso-da-inteligencia-artificial/|access-date=2022-02-17|website=Portal da C\u00e2mara dos Deputados|language=pt-br}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Laying Down Harmonised Rules on Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act)] on [[EUR-Lex]]\n* [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/procedure/EN/2021_106 Procedure 2021/0106/COD] on EUR-Lex\n* [https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&reference=2021/0106(COD) Procedure 2021/0106(COD)] on [[d:Q386647|\u0152IL]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Policies of the European Union]]\n[[Category:European Digital Strategy]]\n[[Category:2021 in law]]\n[[Category:2021 in the European Union]]\n\n\n{{law-stub}}\n{{politics-stub}}"}
