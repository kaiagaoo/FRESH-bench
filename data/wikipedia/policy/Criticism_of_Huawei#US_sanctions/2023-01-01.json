Huawei has stated that its products posed \"no greater cybersecurity risk\" than those of any other vendor, and that there was no evidence of the U.S. espionage claims.

In March 2019, Huawei sued the U.S. government over a military spending bill that restricted the purchase of equipment from Huawei or [[ZTE]] by the government, citing that it had been refused [[due process]]. Huawei exited the U.S. market due to these concerns, which had also made U.S. [[wireless carrier]]s reluctant to sell its products.\n\nHuawei has also faced allegations that it has engaged in [[corporate espionage]] to steal competitors' [[intellectual property]], and in 2019, was restricted from performing commerce with U.S. companies, over allegations that it willfully exported technology of U.S. origin to [[Iran]] in violation of [[United States sanctions against Iran|U.S. sanctions]]. The company has also been accused of assisting in the mass-detention of [[Uyghurs]] in [[Xinjiang internment camps|internment camps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thediplomat.com/2020/02/huaweis-human-rights-record-has-been-shamefully-ignored/|title=Huawei's Human Rights Record Has Been Shamefully Ignored|website=thediplomat.com|access-date=2020-05-25|archive-date=2020-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200504005414/https://thediplomat.com/2020/02/huaweis-human-rights-record-has-been-shamefully-ignored/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chinese-tech-giant-huawei-helps-to-persecute-uighurs-7dfcb56nw|title=Chinese tech giant Huawei 'helps to persecute Uighurs'|first=Caroline|last=Wheeler|via=www.thetimes.co.uk|access-date=2020-05-25|archive-date=2020-05-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200511163329/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chinese-tech-giant-huawei-helps-to-persecute-uighurs-7dfcb56nw|url-status=live}}</ref> and employing forced Uyghur labour in its supply chain.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/03/tory-mp-asks-bt-using-huawei-complies-anti-slavery-policy|title=Tory MP asks BT if using Huawei complies with anti-slavery policy|first=Dan|last=Sabbagh|date=March 3, 2020|via=www.theguardian.com|access-date=May 25, 2020|archive-date=April 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422202834/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/03/tory-mp-asks-bt-using-huawei-complies-anti-slavery-policy|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Intellectual property and theft==\n{{Further|Allegations of intellectual property theft by China}}\n=== Cisco patent lawsuit ===\n[[File:Huawei 4G+ Modem.jpg|thumb|right| Huawei Dual Band LTE Wi-Fi modem]]\nIn 2003 Cisco General Counsel Mark Chandler traveled to Shenzhen to confront Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei with evidence of Huawei's theft of Cisco IP.

T-Mobile claimed in its filed suit that Huawei's employees snuck into a T-Mobile lab during the period of 2012\u20132013 and stole parts of its smartphone testing robot Tappy. The Huawei employees then copied the operating software and design details, violating confidentiality agreements that both companies signed. Furthermore, Huawei is now using the stolen parts and data to build its own testing robot. A Huawei spokesman stated to ''The New York Times'' that there is some truth to the complaint, but that the two employees involved have been fired. T-Mobile has since stopped using Huawei as a supplier, which T-Mobile says could cost it tens of millions of dollars as it moves away from its handsets.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lightreading.com/mobile/devices-smartphones/t-mobile-accuses-huawei-of-espionage/d/d-id/710732 | title=T-Mobile Accuses Huawei of Espionage | date=9 September 2014 | author=Thomas, Sarah | access-date=4 April 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808200015/http://www.lightreading.com/mobile/devices-smartphones/t-mobile-accuses-huawei-of-espionage/d/d-id/710732 | archive-date=8 August 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2017, a jury agreed with T-Mobile that Huawei committed industrial espionage in United States, and Huawei was ordered to pay $4.8&nbsp;million in damages. Huawei responded to the lawsuit by arguing that Tappy was not a trade secret, and that it was made by [[Epson]], not T-Mobile. According to Huawei, \"T-Mobile's statement of the alleged trade secret is an insufficient, generic statement that captures virtually every component of its robot\", and it had failed to point out any trade secret stolen with sufficient specificity. T-Mobile dismissed Huawei's arguments, and contended that Epson had provided only a component of the robot.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/huawei_spied_us_jury_finds |
